{"parent": "12", "title": "", "name": "12_5", "child": "", "content": "The problems with Penn Station represent an overall lack of vision and planning with respect to managing transportation in the tri-state area. Neither Governor Cuomo nor Governor Christie has provided any leadership on this issue.  This failure stems directly from our country's ambivalence toward public transportation.  Ever the rugged individualists, we focus too many of our resources on roads for private automobiles, the least efficient way to move people around a congested region like this.  In other countries, where gasoline is far more expensive, rail transportation is accorded far more respect. It shows up in the form of modern, efficient facilities. The day will come when one of the two Hudson River tunnels goes out of service, whether for planned or unplanned reasons.  The fact that there is still no viable alternative to replace that capacity is beyond irresponsible.  Governor Christie, in particular, has wasted the seven years since canceling the ARC tunnel project and has offered no new options.  We are living on borrowed time, folks.  "}
