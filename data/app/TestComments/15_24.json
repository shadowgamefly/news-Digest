{"title": "", "content": "I think there is nothing wrong with following your dream, or even going to college if you want to. What is problematic is that people don't think outside of their dreams to the reality of making that dream happen. Can I afford college?  What loans can I take out and how much will I have to pay back when they are due? What will I do to pay my bills during and after college? If my field is a difficult one to find success, how can I survive while working towards my goals?  I came out of undergrad with $18,000 in loans (1992). Eight years later, with $5,000 left to pay, I went back to grad school. But the only way I intended to go to grad school was if they paid ME to attend, not the other way around. I found a full-scholarship tuition program, with a monthly stipend. I still took out loans for living expenses, even a couple of private ones (they should be avoided), but it was far less than if I had gone with loans all the way. I just paid everything off 4 years ago. I have no regrets.We are sold this idea of the American Dream, whereby people risk all for their dream, and then lose all when it doesn't come true. It's all or nothing in America. There is something to be said about working slow and steady, doing what you can afford, and not taking such big risks that you can't recover from them if they don't work out. The best thing my parents ever said to me was that while they would always support my dreams, it would be my responsibility to support myself.", "name": "15_24", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
