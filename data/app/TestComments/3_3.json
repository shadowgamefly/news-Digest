The Syrians are not allowed to use chemical weapons.  To do so would be a violation of international law and of treaties agreed to by Syria.  What I heard Mr. Tillerson say is that, even if Russia is not complicit in Syria's use of chemical weapons, they agreed to supervise the elimination of these weapons from Syria's arsenal and they have so far failed to do that.  He also said that he hoped Russia would help arrive at a peaceful resolution of Syria's violent civil war.  To me his comments all seemed right on target. "}
