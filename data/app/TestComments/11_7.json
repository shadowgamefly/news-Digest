{"child": "", "name": "11_7", "title": "", "parent": "11", "content": "This legislation is an illustration of the problems that occur where one political party dominates the state government.  Jerry Brown is of course a quintessential liberal Democrat and and the legislature is controlled by a super-majority of his party.  The situation is so tilted that our liberal governor has frequent vetoed or refused to sign some particularly extreme legislation.  Hopefully he will follow suit to veto this unprincipled and unconstitutional act.  What is ironic is that California and undocumented advocates have successfully urged courts that previous state efforts such as Proposition 187, which attempted to deny benefits to undocumented aliens, violate the Constitution's express declaration that immigration is a federal concern.  This latest effort turns that argument on its head,but is unconstitutional for the same reason.  California has decided that all federal immigration acts will be suspended in this state and that most persons who reach the state, regardless of whether they are legally entitled to be in the United States, will be sheltered against deportation.  Effectively California is making immigration policy, a matter that is expressly reserved to the federal government.  The Constitution expressly states that such state regulation is preempted.  "}
