{"title": "", "content": "As someone who has been paying $1,650 a month in student loans for 12 years (and counting), I certainly have sympathy for these borrowers - to an extent. However, personal accountability has to - needs to - come into play at some point. I could have gone to law school at night, lived at home and worked full time during the day to cut down on costs. Instead I chose to go away to school, and signed those loan documents because I was not thinking about the long term. It was monopoly money to me. I regret it every day, but it was a choice I made. I wasn't hoodwinked, or taken advantage of. In situations where people were lied to by Sallie Mae/Navient, then yes, there should be some recompense. I'm not seeing lies by these companies. I'm not seeing scenarios where low interest rates were falsely promised and then the borrowers were caught in a bait and switch scheme. If you know you are going to photography school and need $150,000 to pay for it, and you know what the interest rates are, why are the lenders to blame?In reading these comments, I don't see a lot of criticism of the academic institutions themselves or the government for subsidizing these federal loans thereby fueling the ability of schools to raise tuition rates ad nauseum. Both are to blame for the skyrocketing costs of tuition in general, which has greatly outpaced inflation and has made it impossible to attend school without taking out loans, getting grants/scholarships, and/or having family assistance.
