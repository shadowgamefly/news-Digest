{"title": "", "content": "It's amazing how many comments focus on the foolishness of students taking out loans, and give a pass to the predatory and fraudulent practices of Navient, Career Education Corporation, etc. Oh, the horror, some people might be forgiven their debt and not learn their lesson! But the corporations that perpetuated this fraud, of course, are free to continue on their merry way.  We're conditioned to blame the swindled for not being savvier, just as we are conditioned to blame rape victims for not being more careful.  Guess what? Survival of the fittest is not how modern society works.  Our system of laws was established to punish wrongdoing, not naivet\u00e9.  The schools and lenders worked together to sell young people on the American dream, while privately acknowledging that many of them would fail to ever repay their debt.  And with a massive 1.4 trillion owed in loans, it looks a lot like average people, not stupid people, trusted colleges and lenders.My wife and I together had almost $100k in student loan debt in graduation - and after ten years of hard work, we're almost done paying it off, without help from anyone else.  But unlike some commenters, I would not begrudge in the least someone else's debt being forgiven.  It would be far healthier for our economy to free people from their Sisyphean debt burdens than to condemn them to debt servitude for the rest of their lives.
