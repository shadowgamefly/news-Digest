{"title": "", "content": "When I applied to graduate school in the summer of 06 it was for a Masters of Fine Art. I was 23 years old and the University I applied to told me they wouldn't be able to get me an assistantship the first semester but they would probably be able to find me something in the following year.I filled out my FASFA and even though I was paying my own bills and living on my own I was told I was 6 months too young to be considered independent as far as a student loan application was concerned. My parents were not claiming me as a dependent and I had a job. Apparently you could appeal the \"dependent\" label if you could prove you were living on your own but they never told me that during the loan process and it was not in the fine print. I was directed to a private \"direct plus\" loan for $15k to cover that 1st semester. As a private loan it gained interest the entire time I was in school. The next year I had a full assistantship, with stipend and tuition remission, but that loan has weighed me down ever since. I have a job in the arts and I make a good salary and it is because I received my MFA in studio art. People here who speak with disdain about getting a MFA know nothing of the field and have no place to criticize. I do realize I am one of the lucky ones, but what I experienced was deceptive, predatory, and should be prosecuted.  Sallie Mae was all too eager to sign me up for a private loan. I have no doubt they deserve at least partial responsibility for this mess.", "name": "15_13", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
