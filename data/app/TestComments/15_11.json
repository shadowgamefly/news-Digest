{"title": "", "content": "Most \"short cuts\" in life lead to an unanticipated cliff - some people survive the fall, many others do not.  I thought the parallels painted between the mortgage crisis and the student loan debacle were spot on.   I certainly do not aim to \"blame the victim\" here, but my God, who hasn't heard of that saying, 'Nothing is as good as it seems\"?  If something IS too good to be true, then it probably isn't so why then even go down that road in the first place?   All I can think of is sometimes the want and desire clouds one's better judgment and common sense, and instinct goes out the window.   I have this debate with my husband all of the time about accredited colleges vs. everything else in between.  He still thinks I am a snob because I graduated from an accredited college. I remind him that nothing can take the place of old fashioned hard work and doing one's homework, which includes investigating the background and accreditations of any potential school or institute.   But in the end, my heart does break for the many individuals who assumed the training and classes they received doesn't even get their foot into the door of any potential employer.
