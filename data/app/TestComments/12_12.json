The original, and still used tunnels under the Hudson and the original Pennsylvania station (replaced by a hodgepodge mess) were created by private capital (the old \"Pennsy\" railroad). We need our local suburban (Dems and GOP) congressmen and not just the big spending/big govt. City Dems for whom it's a big jobs program with plums for favored contractors, to push for such a partnership. Let private capital work with public resources and private investment to rebuild the tunnels, convert the old Post Office to the Moynihan station, and replace those old Amtrak bridges in our area. At least the LIRR commuters will have an alternative when the East Side Access is finished to GCT."}
