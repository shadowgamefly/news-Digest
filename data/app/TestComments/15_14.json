{"title": "", "content": "On the one hand, I can't deny that the students are being taken advantage of- I see it enough myself, being a senior in college. But on the other hand, photography? Really? The examples this article is giving of students is showing that these students really don't have realistic career goals or expectations. I can't tell you how many people I see drowning in student debt because they're \"finding themselves\" for over four years or \"following their passion.\" Maybe we need to be giving kids more realistic expectations about their work lives as they grow up? As in \"NO, you can't be anything you want to be.\" It might also help if we developed some system where only the top of a high school class goes to college, much like in Germany. Do we really need to give everyone a college degree? Yes, I know it seems like a lot of jobs require it and it's the only way to get by these days. But instead of figuring out how to get everyone into college and turn it into a business, why don't we instead figure out how to structure our economy to deal with a majority of workers NOT having gone to college? Vocational school maybe? And for those who do go to college, heavily subsidize it because we need them as innovators and if its only a fraction of graduates, it's not that much of a burden to society. And suddenly you won't have a business of going to school, because there's less of a market base for that behavior.", "name": "15_14", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
