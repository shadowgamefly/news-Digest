{"title": "", "content": "At some point, the profit-motive morphed from the model of a-fair-price-for-a-fair-product to a model of predatory capitalism that is essentially the age-old art of swindling.  Unfortunately for hapless consumers and borrowers, the apparatus of the state - at least the legislative branch - which should be the honest broker and referee in such transactions, has been subverted to support the objectives of the predators.  Even \"neutral\" state organs, such as the courts, find their hands tied in the face of arbitration clauses that preclude  justice for the injured.  This is exactly what democratic socialists are talking about when they decry a rigged system that has created an uneven playing field: a \"heads-we-win-tails-you-lose\" system in which average Americans are completely at the mercy of corporations, a system facilitated and buttressed by (largely but by no means exclusively Republican) politicians who are  bought and paid for by these same corporations.  This story is yet one more example of how money has corrupted our democracy and how this corruption is ruining people's lives every day.  This is why we need a constitutional amendment overturning the Citizens United decision and banning all private campaign contributions.  Elected representatives should be beholden only to voters and not to those who write the biggest checks.", "name": "15_17", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
