{"child": "", "name": "11_6", "title": "", "parent": "11", "content": "Agriculture, construction, home care, all rely heavily on both documented and undocumented workers. Immigrants of both sorts contribute far more to our economy than you are perhaps willing to recognize, and both groups have a lower rate of violent crime than native born citizens.  When undocumented workers fear for their families and don't show up to work, crops rot in the fields, things go unbuilt, and people and animals go uncared for.  When employers try hiring legal immigrants or citizens, most of the jobs go unfilled.  We've turned a blind eye as a nation to the way our economy is supported at the bottom level by undocumented workers, so is it really fair, just, or humanitarian to suddenly deport people who have been working here for a decade (the average time an undocumented person has been living in the U.S.), to break up their families, to send young adults who have only ever known life in the U.S. to a country they do not remember and have no ties to?Also, net migration across the Mexican border has for some years been at zero or actually INTO Mexico.  Undocumented immigration that is on the rise is mainly from Central America, sub-saharan Africa, and some Asian countries."}
