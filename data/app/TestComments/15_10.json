{"title": "", "content": "I have published much on the way that student loans and the neo-liberal university are destroying the future of the United States.  It was the subject of the panel we did at the Pacific Sociological Association on Saturday, April 8th.  The switch from thinking of education as a social benefit to the mindset that it is an investment in one's individual success in marketing oneself as a product is rapidly impoverishing the nation.  This is only part of the issue that includes school vouches and charter schools based on the same notion.  It is an assault on democracy that requires an educated public and it is happening scarily fast. Debt and rising tuition falls especially hard on students who want to enter the arts, humanities, and helping professions.  It is hard to imagine borrowing even a modest amount, say 50k, and trying to pay it off while working as a teacher in K-12 schools where starting pay in my state of Arizona is lass than 35k in many districts.", "name": "15_10", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
