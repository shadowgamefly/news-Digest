{"title": "", "content": "As someone who has paid off over $100,000 in student loans, held by Sallie Mae/Navient, I have little sympathy for these borrowers. I thought long and hard before signing the paperwork for my student loans, fully understanding the huge financial responsibility that I would be undertaking. I researched my career choice and employment prospects to be sure that the risk was worth taking. I realized that I would be responsible for these loans regardless of whether or not I could find work in my chosen field and was fully prepared to do what I needed to do to meet my obligation. There needs to be some personal accountability in all of this. If the likelihood of employment in a given field is very low, then logic should dictate that taking on a tremendous debt load to get a degree in that field is a poor financial decision. Yes, there are predatory lenders, but they can only prey on you if you allow them to. Some lessons are learned the hard way.", "name": "15_1", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
