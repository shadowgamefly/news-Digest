{"title": "", "content": "Besides predatory lending that needs be outlawed, there are serious issues in this country that need to be addressed: 1) American's lack of financial literacy, 2) unfunded community colleges, and 3) the lack of substantial vocational training.

Community colleges across the nation have long waiting lists for mandatory classes. Funding needs to be reinstated! Finally, we need to get over the idea that everyone needs to go to university.
