Stumpf will only forfeit $28 million from compensation that had yet to be paid under a 2013 equity grant.  He retains the $137 million in compensation from stock option compensation that he \"earned.\"  That level of compensation certainly raises questions when Wells Fargo used a \"decentralized structure,\" in which department heads were given the authority to \"run it like you own it.\"  Given that, why did Wells Fargo so handsomely compensate Mr. Stumpf in the first place?As for Carrie Tolstedt, what is her punishment?  She set unrealistic sales goals that were bad for customers, created a toxic culture, mislead the Board of Directors, and was an insular leader.  No doubt Ms. Tolstedt was paid tens of millions of dollars.  If she keeps most of that money doesn't that reward her terrible management and lies?  What reason is there for anyone to follow ethical business practices if Ms. Tolstedt keeps more money that most of us will earn in our lifetimes, which she earned by creating a toxic organization?"}
