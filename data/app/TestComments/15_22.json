{"title": "", "content": "I was in the credit industry for many, many years. I've seen my share of people who, for a myriad of reasons, have huge difficulties paying back their loans. I've met my share of people who have no legitimate reason for non-payment. One thing of which I am certain: most people want to pay their loans back. Here's where I depart from the self-righteous commentators on this thread who feel no sympathy for those struggling to pay back their student loans. The student loan industry is set up to line the pockets of a huge number of 3rd parties who never had anything to do with providing an education to the borrower and whose only purpose is to profit. The fact that \"sub-prime\" and student loan occur within the same essay is evidence that too many predators lie in the background of this whole industry.Just a side bar: Here in Europe, the societies pay into the college systems. Students don't graduate with enormous debt and, surprise-surprise, they're as smart as any Americans I've met.", "name": "15_22", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
