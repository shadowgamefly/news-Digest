Crocker, perhaps the most experienced American career diplomat in the region, and dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.\"In other words, do not encourage Trump as Bumbler-in-Chief.(Haven't we had enough of this already.)The main issue of concern for Putin is the matter of the economic sanctions currently being leveled against Russia.The lifting of those sanctions would be a grave error.The only issue of importance at this point in time is the investigation of the interference of Russia in our election processes.If required, corrective action must be taken or the interference will surely occur again.We cannot afford to have further distortions in our election processes as it causes turmoil among us.All else should be put on hold until this matter is resolved through the current and ongoing investigations.Let us hope that Secretary Tillerson does not compromise on the issue of our elections.In fact let us hope that he questions Putin closely on this matter."}
