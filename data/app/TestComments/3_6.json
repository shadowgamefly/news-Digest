General McMaster doesn't want to destroy Assad's ability to commit mass murder, he just doesn't want him to actually commit mass murder, and definitely not with chemical weapons.  Good to know.  Neither is willing to commit to further action even if civilians are killed in large numbers, as long as they are killed with conventional weapons instead of chemical weapons.  Good to know. Our U. N. Ambassador apparently didn't get the memo that it's okay for Assad to keep killing people as long as chemical weapons are not involved, and even then we  might just lob a few more missiles to let Assad know we won't stand idly by, but in any case Assad can stay until the Syrians hold \"elections.\"  Well, I don't fault Nikki Haley for that, if we had a State Department with staff maybe somebody would have thought to shoot off a memo to keep her in the know.I think Putin is smiling and rubbing his hands together with glee.  You see, Putin knew where Obama stood on stuff because, like him or not, Obama was pretty clear on where he stood.  Now we have the shape shifting administration with no staff and nobody being consistent about anything, and a president who is happy to drop a few bombs whenever he feels like it without talking to Congress.The global instability Mr. Putin is hoping for is at hand.  Good to know.  "}
