{"title": "", "content": "Here's my student loan story. In medical school, I took out a loan I could well afford to pay back. Entirely absorbed in my studies, I never did figure out how my principle always stayed about the same, even though I paid the required amount every month and on time. The five post medical years of training brought in a liveable wage but not enough to pay down my loan. And, mind you, I worked some 80 hours a week, so there was no time to splurge. Thankfully, I owned a home and mortgage rates dropped sharply in the 1990's. So I refinanced my house with some cash out to pay off the student loan. The loan didn't disappear, however;  I continued to pay in that my house payments went on longer than it should have. What's the remedy for predatory loans? Other than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is suing Navient, I know of no other counter weight.  Yet the Republicans would eliminate or severely weaken this much needed agency. Yesterday, I heard all I could take of a Congressional hearing of this agency; the Republicans were absolutely vile in their treatment of Richard Cordray, who heads this agency. Well, I saw it as a despicable attack on those powerless against corporate practices. For those law and order conservatives, how about a crack down on white collar crime? Leave the victims alone.
