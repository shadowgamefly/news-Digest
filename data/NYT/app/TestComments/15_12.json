{"title": "", "content": "The man problem I see is one I also had: being 18 yrs old, full of enthusiasm, and totally inexperienced in financial matters. As a result, I attended Pratt Institute, a top art school, to study illustration, not understanding that this was an extremely competitive field.  I saved money from all my part time jobs in high school for college and was able to pay the first years costs. Working part time during school and full time the summers, and with help from my parents, ( they also were unaware of how difficult it was to make a living from illustration; they just \"knew\" that college was \"good\") I was able to pay for the next 2 years. For my senior year, I borrowed tuition and fees, not from Sallie Mae (was not around then). For 10 years I paid the loan.My point: dreams, enthusiasm, overpower logic, especially in creative fields. Ashley Hardin experienced this. I was lucky; with connections and school placement services, I had a very successful career. If I knew in advance, how difficult my chosen field would be, I probably would have chosen my second choice; accounting. In my case, I was fortunate.I have extreme sympathy for Ashley. We both followed our soul.", "name": "15_12", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
