On a day trip to Giverny, we were able to take the subway to Paris Saint Lazard, buy our intercity train ticket to Vernon-Giverny, where we followed the Giverny footsteps to the Giverny shuttle buses.  A fabulous day on wonderful French public transportation.  Agree with other readers that US public transportation is long overdue for infrastructure improvements.  Amtrak cannot be totally at fault when federal, state, and city governments fail to plan ahead and fully fund public transportation.  The US is woefully behind the rest of the world, particularly in Europe."}
