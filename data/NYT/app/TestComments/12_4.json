Singapore, so modern, Japan same, all signs in English, information booths to help a traveller, spotlessly clean toilets in every station, try and find one in NY.After reading this article I understand more now but what a pity we just can't keep up here because of dysfunctional departments and bickering and has nothing to present to the public and the farce about the extended 2nd ave line that has been worked on for 50 years?I was waiting for the subway recently on a Sunday, three lines had been closed, NO notice anywhere, no maps except for the new booths on the platforms that if you're down the other end you might not know they exhist, a man from Hong Kong said to me the subway system was like his hometown in the 60's. Then there are the airports but I won't go there haha     "}
