{"title": "", "content": "I feel like most people saw the student debt crisis coming. I think my professor covered the topic in Macroeconomics II. The idea is simple. We've placed the burden of professional success on individuals incapable of sustaining the financial cost. Thus, we've managed to crowd out both professional success and future consumption. Doomed to failure is an appropriate phrase.The inevitable financial remoras ensue. You wonder why our recovery is sluggish and uncertain? Society has once again stolen from our future. The price of admission to a median income these days is crippling debt. And for what? So middle aged sales people can take home a paycheck and the wealthy can watch their stocks grow? The bargain is misguided and selfish. The economic morass of the next few decades is entirely the result of greed.Education is a public good that sustains economic prosperity. There is no justifiable argument that supersedes this indelible fact. Do you want your workforce well trained and well educated? Well, you'll need to pay for it, not profit by it. The ultimate result of our current situation is the smartest members of society delaying, avoiding, or forgoing education in favor of other less favorable opportunities. Either that or they languish in an economic despair with little opportunity for escape.You might not care now but wait. When your own child or grandchild is on the chopping block, you might not find yourself so sanguine. The truth is we need public higher education.", "name": "15_7", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
