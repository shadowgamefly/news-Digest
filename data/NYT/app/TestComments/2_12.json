{"content": "This man is going to insert his personal religious beliefs into our body of laws.  He uses the notion of protecting \"religious freedom\" to make rulings that promote his particular religious views.  His views are antithetical to the rights of the majority of Americans who do not share his religious beliefs, and violate the specific prohibition against favoring one religion over others enshrined in the Constitution.  He holds a patriarchal view of women's rights with respect to reproductive freedom, a view not shared by a majority of men and women in the US.  His prior rulings indicate a callous indifference to working people that consistently favor corporate interests.Mr. Gorsuch's confirmation represents a profound erosion of the third branch of our secular, democratic government.  It joins the Legislative and Executive branches in an historic GOP takeover of US law, policy, and the power to implement.  The arrogant dismissal by Mitch McConnell of President Obama's constitutional right to name a Supreme Court candidate is symptomatic of a dangerous lurch toward one-party rule and eventually authoritarian leadership and plutocratic governance.  The only antidote to this shift is a thorough disputation of GOP policies and tactics by Democrats and mobilization of the Left.\"Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.\"  John Adams, Second President of the Unite States", "child": "", "name": "2_12", "title": "", "parent": "2"}
