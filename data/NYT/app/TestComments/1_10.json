{"child": "", "name": "1_10", "parent": "1", "title": "", "content": "I have been a Wells Fargo customer for almost 25 years. I started having doubts about their business practices a few years ago when they were the first of the large banks to announce that they were going to begin charging their own customers $3/month to use the bank's ATM machines. This was only rescinded after  a huge uproar. I also resented their sales tactics every time I called about my account, usually to tell them I would be traveling. Although it has taken two months to unwind my checking & savings accounts, I've just finished moving my business to a (much) smaller bank that provides all of the services that Wells Fargo provides, but with the added bonus that I will be spared any future Wells Fargo shenanigans."}
