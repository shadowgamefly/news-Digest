The fault falls squarely in the lap of our congress who has failed for more than a century to make the investments necessary to innovate and build rail infrastructure. We spend federal tax dollars on building and maintaining roads and highways, why would we expect a semi-private, desperately underfunded company like Amtrak (and Conrail) to maintain the nation's commuter rails? When you travel to any developed nation in Europe or Asia, the depth of our inadequate rail system is quickly evident. Ask your congressman why."}
