Two weeks ago they had one line, now they take a different approach. Trump spins off in either more directions.  This is not foreign policy: it is incoherent and lacks experience, background knowledge or a sense of historical or cultural context as well as the implications for other treaties and alliances.  The diplomats with real expertise have been sideline or isolated.It is good to take a strong moral lead about condemning atrocities, and also to be cautious about military and other interventions.  But there is a reason that we work with allies, and that the United Nations is an important global body.  An investigation by the U.N. would have been reassuring before missiles were launched.  The United States is not in this world alone, and there is a complex network of ties and consequences about any action.George W. Bush drew mockery when he said that he got a sense of Putin's soul from looking into his eyes.  Trump has many, many times praised Putin now and had Putin help him when the presidential election.  There are Trump financial ties and political ties as well as those in his inner circle that are under investigation now.  Nothing Tillerson, Haley or others say means much when Trump can tweet out something completely different in the middle of the night.Inexperience and changing minute-by-minute views or actions like the Syrian bombing do not bring stability or confidence."}
