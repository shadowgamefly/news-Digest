{"title": "", "content": "The thing that bothers me is this treats the rest of us like chumps. My husband and I had student loans, his were exponential. However, we did our due diligence and had good degrees. Granted, from state schools, but still solid degrees. We took ten years to pay them off. No new cars or vacations or houses. But, we did it. When we decided to start a family we planned to save for the kids education (our parents were too poor). We did, again, working hard, living below our means, but all 3 of our kids went to college and graduated debt free. Again, state schools, but good ones. Now these people come along and just sign up for whatever is there, no research, no checking on the schools and we're going to be on the hook for their default. In the meantime chumps like us just pay and pay and pay. ", "name": "15_4", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
