Imagine the chaos if each state could admit its own immigrants from foreign countries and manage its own international borders.  I think this debate was settled centuries ago.  California's proposed action would fly in the face of our federal system of government.And if state officials in California take affirmative steps to thwart the enforcement of the federal immigration laws in concert with illegal immigrants (as opposed to simply refusing to take action, which is their right of course), I'd support federal indictments against these officials for criminal conspiracy.
