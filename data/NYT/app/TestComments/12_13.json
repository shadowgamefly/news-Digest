That is their first bewilderment. Their eyes start to twinkler again when we get on BQE driving towards Manhattan and see the skyscrapers and iconic towers. And then we get on MTA to visit those towers and their second bewilderment show up on their faces. They just can't believe what they see; the smell, the trash, the unfinished and soot covered tunnels and walls.
