Putin is a thief like Assad and they fix elections.  The incredible amount of thievery from the treasuries of their respective countries begs the question of what anyone can or will do about it.  Per capita GDP in Russia has taken a nosedive.  Assad, like Putin, would rather keep bombing so that they and their cronies can keep stealing.  Destabilization is the friend of kleptocrats and we accomplish very little by slapping their hands other than allowing ourselves a \"feel good\" moment."}
