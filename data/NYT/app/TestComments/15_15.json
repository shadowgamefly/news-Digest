{"title": "", "content": "I went to a city college, a state medical school, and chose a graduated repayment plan, and then paid it off early. That is the way it should be. The difference between me and my loan provider (American Education Service) and others who went through Navient is that they were not given the option to have a graduated repayment plan. When they had a hard time paying for the loan, automatically they were shuffled into deferment where their debt would just compound. And when they wanted to add an extra payment, it would just be added to the interest, NOT the principal, unless they were diligent about calling someone, being put on hold, and haggling to get the payment added to the principal. Navient did not make it feasible for students to pay back their debts, they made it hard, and that was their business plan. If I had Navient, all the things I had done to get out of debt would have been difficult or impossible. Sounds predatory to me, right?", "name": "15_15", "parent": "15", "child": ""}
