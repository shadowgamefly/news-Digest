Like their counterpart ISIS they have publicly and openly committed atrocities such as beheading POW's and publishing their grizzly act on Youtube.Assad has been both on and off our hit list for reasons that have nothing to do with promoting democracy. Initially Syria was one of seven nations scheduled for regime change. Then he was off because he helped us with 9/11 retention prisons. We have typically operated under a might makes right theory of our actions in the world.When the Arab Spring erupted we did nothing to support it. Instead we lent our support to our favorite dictators like Mubarek of Egypt. The Syrian people have been used as pawns in our own geopolitical game and the current standoff with Russia is just more of the same.The policy we need but haven't gotten from any US presidents is one that would confront Saudi Arabia. The Saudi's financed, armed and supported radical jihadism throughout the world. Of the 19 9/11 hijackers 15 were Saudi's. Trump may talk tough about ISIS and radical Islam, but like his predecessors is playing hands off those with the oil and the dollars, despite their many crimes. What does Tillerson have to say about that? "}
