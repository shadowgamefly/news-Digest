One form is the movement from holding at large elections to voting by district, where the boundaries are drawn to guarantee that members of a particular race/ethnicity are always elected.And never forget that all election districts are carved up on the basis of population, raw numbers. Legally here, illegally here, citizen and non citizen alike. So, it's possible, in fact it's happening, that in California, districts are formed that contain so many illegal \"immigrants\" who can't vote that voter turnout is very low and elections can be commandeered with a very small number of votes.http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-voting-rights-minorities-calif..."}
