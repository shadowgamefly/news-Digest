{"name": "1383", "parent": "", "content": "Donald Trump and The Definition of\u00a0Insanity 58,000 mental health professionals say Donald Trump is too unstable to be president. Here\u2019s a deep dive into the diagnosis and what could happen because of it. (tl;dr\u00a0here) Albert Einstein is famously quoted: \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting something to change.\u201d This is not, of course, the actual definition of insanity. It also turns out Einstein never said this. It actually comes from an Alcoholics Anonymous pamphlet from the 1980s. Which is apropos, because nearly 60,000 mental health professionals have diagnosed President Donald Trump with a type of insanity that is often compared to an alcoholic\u2019s lack of honesty and impulse control. Sparked by Change.org petitions by a top former Johns Hopkins professor and a California congresswoman, the psychiatric community has declared that Trump suffers from \u201cMalignant Narcissism.\u201d What is that exactly? Does Trump actually suffer from it? If so, what does that mean? With the help of some concerned psychologists, we\u2019ve broken the answers down. Psychologists say that Trump\u2019s condition is a combination of mental disorders that cause one to distort reality and make violent, impulsive decisions. These disorders form, according to the doctor who coined the term Malignant Narcissism in the 1960s, \u201cthe most severe pathology and the root of the most vicious destructiveness.\u201d (Full criteria below.) This is the first time in history that so many mental health professionals have collectively diagnosed a living individual. Their conclusion, based on the hundreds of hours of Trump\u2019s on-camera dialogue and off-the-cuff public speaking, is alarming because it says that our current president is too mentally disturbed to fulfill his office. To be clear: Being a standard deviation or two away from the norm when it comes to one\u2019s psychology does not automatically make a person dangerous, bad, or unable to do a job. Millions of people have depression, anxiety, or mild mania and still function well. Abraham Lincoln went through depression, after all. Unfortunately, unlike many other mental disorders, Malignant Narcissism makes its sufferers actively dangerous to other people. It\u2019s more akin to delusional schizophrenia than it is to anxiousness. In diagnosing Donald trump, mental health pros are breaking with a decades-old precedent. After Barry Goldwater won a 1969 defamation lawsuit when psychiatrists called him crazy in Fact magazine, the psychiatric community put in place a \u201cGoldwater Rule\u201d in their ethics handbook that forbids diagnosing public figures. So why are psychologists breaking with tradition now? A big problem during the Goldwater scenario was that there weren\u2019t objective criteria for diagnosing mental health conditions at the time. Therapists used all sorts of jargon and their best judgment\u2014but they were all over the place. Since then, however, the community has put in place official, objective standards in their bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM for short). This makes it possible to unanimously agree on diagnoses. The real reason for breaking with the code, however, is principle. Someone in power with Malignant Narcissism is likely to get people killed, and psychologists who know this feel morally obligated to speak up. This has legal precedent in a court case called Tarasoff vs Regents, in which the murder of a woman could have been prevented if the killer\u2019s psychotherapist had warned her or police that the man might kill her. This resulted in The Tarasoff Rule: \u201cWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profession, should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger.\u201d In Judaism, there is a principle called \u201cPikuach Nefesh\u201d which says that it\u2019s okay to break a rule in order to save a human life. Many in the mental health community believe that Donald Trump\u2019s psychosis is that kind of a life-or-death situation, and that since he sees no mental health doctor, the Tarasoff Rule should supersede the Goldwater Rule. Thousands of psychologists feel morally justified in this. (And some even are saying it is immoral to not speak up.) In addition to the mental health community, senators and congresspeople from both parties have expressed concern about Trump\u2019s mental health. Whether they are right or not has enormous implications. \u201cI genuinely do not think this is a mentally healthy president.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEliot Cohen, US State Department under George W.\u00a0Bush Decoding Donald Trump\u2019s Mental Condition Malignant Narcissism, according to John D. Gartner, one of the country\u2019s top psychologists, is basically a combination of three mental illnesses\u200a\u2014\u200aAnti-social Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Narcissistic Personality Disorder\u200a\u2014\u200aplus sadism, or the enjoyment of inflicting pain. \u201cThe concept was developed by a famed psychologist named Erich Fromm, who escaped Nazi Germany, as a way to describe evil,\u201d Gartner says. \u201cHe used it to describe Hitler.\u201d That\u2019s pretty scary. And unfortunately, the assertion that Trump has it is not something that can be chalked up to politics. \u201cEven though I disagree with everything he stands for, I would be immensely relieved to have a president Pence. He\u2019s conservative; he\u2019s not crazy,\u201d Gartner told me. Paul Ryan? He\u2019d be great, too. \u201cMartin Luther King famously said the arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. If we hit a traffic jam on the way to social progress, we\u2019ll still get there,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re all dead from a nuclear war, we won\u2019t.\u201d Which is exactly what someone with Malignant Narcissism might start. Gartner, who taught personality disorders at Johns Hopkins University for 28 years and explained Bill Clinton\u2019s mental issues in the book In Search of Bill Clinton: A Psychological Biography, says Trump\u2019s illness might be called \u201cDictator Personality Disorder.\u201d Malignant Narcissism often coincides with mild mania\u200a\u2014\u200athe ability to consistently stay up all night obsessing on a project\u200a\u2014\u200awhich helps sufferers achieve high career status despite their cruel tendencies. Trump exhibits this, too. \u201cI\u2019ve been a specialist in personality disorders for 35 years,\u201d Gartner says. \u201cTrump is the most severe case I\u2019ve seen in my\u00a0career.\u201d The DSM is clear about what constitutes the three personality disorders that add up to Malignant Narcissism. Here they are broken down: Now let\u2019s take a look at Donald Trump\u2019s behavior\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the public record\u200a\u2014\u200aagainst the criteria: Antisocial Personality Disorder Trump exhibits 6 of the 7 of the traits of Antisocial Personality Disorder. You only need to have 3 to be given the diagnosis: Donald Trump\u2019s diagnostic scorecard for Antisocial Personality Disorder Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors Trump consistently qualifies for this one. Here\u2019s an abridged list: This list goes on, but the above are plenty enough to check this box. Deceitfulness: Repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or\u00a0pleasure The list of Trump\u2019s public lies is extensive and well-known. Politifact has tracked his public statements and found that Trump says things that are completely and demonstrably false more than he says things that are true or even half-true. His use of aliases is less well-known. Here\u2019s a report, which includes audio, of him pretending to be his own publicist\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cJohn Barron\u201d or \u201cJohn Miller,\u201d depending on the decade\u200a\u2014\u200aand bragging about how great he is. See the above Trump University for evidence of one of his business instances of conning others for profit. Impulsivity, or failure to plan\u00a0ahead According to Pew, most Americans think Trump is too impulsive. Here are a few recent examples: Irritability and aggressiveness Trump\u2019s irritability is well documented. He\u2019s proud of his aggressiveness (he even has a book called Time To Get Tough), which we repeatedly see in his debates, interviews, and tweets that he calls \u201csmackdowns.\u201d He encouraged his followers to be aggressive and violent during his campaign. And most recently from the White House: Trump treats his staff badly. Here\u2019s a list of 23 aggressive things he\u2019s said in recent memory. Reckless disregard for safety of self or\u00a0others This one there\u2019s not much (clinical) evidence of so far. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations Trump\u2019s having not honored his financial obligations is well documented. Here\u2019s a recent report on the hundreds of contractors and workers he ripped off as a hotel developer. He\u2019s declared bankruptcy six times and walked away from his debts over and over. The list of his failed business ventures is extensive due to inconsistent management behavior. His work behavior as president and a candidate before that has been inconsistent. During the campaign, he switched to \u201cacting presidential\u201d several times and could only keep it up for a few days at a time. Lack of remorse, or being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from\u00a0another Trump\u2019s 8 books are full of insults toward everyone from models to celebrities to random private citizens. He relishes tearing people down on Twitter, and refused to apologize for insulting the parents of a dead U.S. soldier, or to the black community for his racist campaign against Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship. In fact, here\u2019s a list that Mashable put together of all the times Trump refused to apologize for things. Paranoid Personality Disorder Trump exhibits at least 5 out of the 7 qualifications for Paranoid Personality Disorder. Only 4 are needed for a diagnosis: Donald Trump\u2019s diagnostic scorecard for Antisocial Personality Disorder Suspects that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving him During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly accused the media of being biased against him. He claimed, with no evidence, that the election was going to be rigged against him. Since then, he\u2019s accused the parks department, Republicans, and the intelligence community of trying to tear him, his daughter, and the validity of his election down. He made up a story that 3\u20135 million people illegally voted against him. These accusations have proven to be overblown or bogus. Preoccupied with doubts about the loyalty of friends or associates It\u2019s hard to get Trump\u2019s trust, and easy to get him to fire you for perceived disloyalty. He doesn\u2019t trust his staff, except for a few in the inner circle. He doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence agents who work for him. Federal workers don\u2019t trust him to not spy on them. And it didn\u2019t look like he trusted his wife to vote for him: How much this preoccupies him is hard to say. But Trump is reported to be as paranoid in this area as Nixon, who was quite paranoid. Reluctant to confide in\u00a0others Trump is mostly paranoid of people he sees as outside of his circle of trust. He\u2019s keeping top officials out of his inner circle and elevating a few loyalists to lofty places. But he has a close circle of confidants that he shares information with (Bannon, Conway, Kushner, etc.). So it would be hard to conclude that he qualifies for this one. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or\u00a0events Trump believes in various conspiracy theories based on vague information from tiny corners of the Internet (falsehoods like Barack Obama\u2019s not being born in the US, Hilary Clinton using performance-enhancing drugs for the debates, Ted Cruz\u2019s father assassinating JFK, etc.), which is the definition of finding hidden meanings in benign events. His favorite writer is conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who among other things helped get the \u201c9/11 was an inside job\u201d conspiracy theory going. Additionally, his overreactions to the petty\u200a\u2014\u200alike Sean Spicer being played by a woman on SNL or the size of his inauguration crowd\u200a\u2014\u200abetray a paranoia of anything he perceives as a threat to his image. The classic case of this is his weird defensiveness about the size of his hands. Persistently bears\u00a0grudges Trump readily admits to this one. \u201cWhen people treat me unfairly, I don\u2019t let them forget it,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s an abridged list of people and organizations Trump has had public grudges with: His staff had to take his Twitter access away from him in the final days of the election because they worried his obsession with Twitter vengeance might jeopardize the election. As Trump communication aide Omarosa Manigault says, \u201cMr. Trump has a long memory and we\u2019re keeping a list.\u201d Perceives attacks on his character or reputation and is quick to react angrily or counterattack See the above list of grudges. Trump is infamous for publicly lashing out at people for slights big and small, from Meryl Streep to random blue collar workers. The New York Times put together this handy list of 307 people, places, and things Trump has insulted. Here\u2019s an example of a counterattack for a slight from his own party: Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual\u00a0partner There\u2019s not enough public information to conclude anything on this one. Narcissistic Personality Disorder This one is perhaps the most obvious and heavily documented. Trump surpasses the minimum of 5, exhibiting at least 9 of the signs: Donald Trump\u2019s diagnostic scorecard for Narcissistic Personality Disorder Grandiose sense of self-importance Exaggerates achievements and talents\u200a\u2014\u200acheck. (Size of election win, size of inauguration crowd, number of jobs saved in Carrier negotiation, and so on.) Expects to be recognized as superior\u200a\u2014\u200acheck. Expects recognition without commensurate achievements\u200a\u2014\u200acheck. Politifact has a whole list of Trump\u2019s such tall tales here. But we\u2019ll let the following quotations by Donald Trump himself clinch this and the next two checkboxes: Preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance; Believes he is \u201cspecial\u201d and\u00a0unique \u201cNobody knows more about taxes than I do, maybe in the history of the world.\u201d \u201cNo one has more respect for women than me.\u201d \u201cI have the best temperament or certainly one of the best temperaments of anybody that\u2019s ever run for the office of president. Ever.\u201d \u201cLook, I know more about renewables than any human being on earth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to the Secret Service.\u201d \u201cI write a book called The Art of the Deal, the #1 selling business book of all time.\u201d \u201cNobody reads the Bible more than me.\u201d \u201cNo one has done more for people with disabilities than me.\u201d \u201cI am the least racist person you\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody\u2019s ever been more successful than me.\u201d Requires excessive adoration Trump\u2019s ego-stoking \u201cvictory tour,\u201d obsession with ratings before and after entering politics, and fixation on the size of his electoral win, inauguration crowd, and his (false) claim of having received the biggest standing ovation ever easily check this one off. Has a sense of entitlement He certainly grew up with a silver spoon, but it\u2019s unclear how entitled he thinks he is, in the clinical definition. So no check for this one. Interpersonally exploitative This post on Medium by my colleague Brad Hamilton (editor of The Contently Foundation and former investigations editor at New York Post) recounts how Trump exploited several people, including Brad, in order to get publicity for his golf course one time. This type of behavior, to use a regrettable pun, is par for him. Trump\u2019s own books talk a lot about his strategies for exploiting people. Lacks empathy We covered the evidence for this one pretty thoroughly earlier. Trump is not remorseful about his hurting people. He\u2019s dismissive of many people\u2019s pain\u200a\u2014\u200aeven pain he\u2019s caused them\u200a\u2014\u200awhile simultaneously claiming that \u201cno one understands\u201d them better than he does. Often envious of others or believes that others are envious of\u00a0him Trump\u2019s been jealous of his senior adviser being put on the cover of Time Magazine, his running-mate having a great debate performance, and the fact that Jay-Z and Beyonce performed for Clinton instead of him. And he claims that Republicans are \u201cjealous as hell\u201d that Russian president Vladimir Putin likes him. Arrogant: haughty behaviors or attitudes We\u2019ve now thoroughly established this one. But here are a few more quotes by Mr. Trump that remove any doubt about his arrogrance: \u201cMy IQ is one of the highest\u200a\u2014\u200aand you all know it! Please don\u2019t feel so stupid or insecure; it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d \u201cI think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I\u2019m more honest and my women are more beautiful.\u201d \u201cAll of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me\u200a\u2014\u200aconsciously or unconsciously. That\u2019s to be expected.\u201d \u201cNobody builds walls better than me, believe me.\u201d From Donald Trump\u2019s diagnostic scorecard for Antisocial Personality Disorder Sadism Trump has been a bully since he was a child. We\u2019ve already gone over some of his well-documented history of relishing humiliating people and groups weaker than himself. This is classic sadism. The court deposition by Trump\u2019s ex-wife, recounted in Harry Hurt\u2019s biography Lost Tycoon, paints a disturbing picture of a sadistic episode where Trump pulls his wife\u2019s hair out and violates her to make himself feel better after a painful surgery: Manipulation Many politicians could be categorized as manipulative. Trump is not a typical politician, but he literally wrote books on manipulation. His history and tactics of manipulation\u200a\u2014\u200afrom his followers to opponents to the media\u200a\u2014\u200aare well-documented. Use of projection When Trump defends accusations of racism by calling someone else a racist, that\u2019s psychological projection. He does this sort of thing all the time. One of the most surprising moments of Trump\u2019s presidential debates with Hillary Clinton was the time she accused him of being a Russian puppet, and he automatically projected the accusation\u200a\u2014\u200awith nothing close to evidence\u200a\u2014\u200adirectly back on her: Here\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s scorecard for Malignant Narcissism: There is no question. Donald Trump suffers from Malignant Narcissism. No other president has come close to this disorder. Manipulation is a common trait among politicians. It\u2019s part of the definition of politics. Bill Clinton could be deceitful. George W. Bush showed some reckless tendencies (DUIs, etc.). Barack Obama could be private and a touch arrogant. But none of them remotely qualify as mentally ill. Trump, on the other hand, over-qualifies. Says Dr. Gartner, \u201cIf I wanted to take out the DSM and say, \u2018I want to create a Frankenstein monster\u200a\u2014\u200aI want to create the most dangerous leader that could possibly be imagined\u200a\u2014\u200aand I had a free hand to mix and match any set of diagnoses and symptoms, I couldn\u2019t improve on Donald Trump.\u201d So what\u00a0now? We need President Trump to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. If he refuses to do so, that\u2019s bad news. Refusal itself could be validation of his personality disorder. People with personality disorders generally won\u2019t consider that they might not be all right, whereas mentally healthy people will generally want to know if they have a problem. And if Trump can be persuaded to sit down for an objective psychiatric evaluation\u2014not from a doctor under his employ\u2014there\u2019s a high probability that he will be diagnosed with the mental illnesses we\u2019ve discussed. Which will mean that he is not healthy enough to be president. The 25th Amendment of the Constitution says that the vice president and a majority of the president\u2019s cabinet can vote to remove the president for being \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d This was put into place after Kennedy was shot, in case a president becomes too ill, injured, or mentally unwell to perform. Removing Trump would be tough because his cabinet is made of people who he\u2019s chosen himself. There\u2019s no restraining hand to stop him. However, if the cabinet did decide to listen to the psychiatric community and remove Trump, someone with Malignant Narcissism like him would likely not go quietly. With his back to the wall, there\u2019s no way to predict what a sadistic, antisocial, paranoid narcissist in command of special forces, a Twitter army, and nuclear codes will do. But the danger of not removing him is very clear. \u201cWe\u2019ve had presidents with psychological disorders,\u201d Gartner points out. Lincoln had depression, after all. \u201cBut this is unique. We\u2019re not just talking about mental illness, we\u2019re talking about the worst possible mental illness.\u201d Shane Snow is a journalist, speaker, and entrepreneur in New York City.
