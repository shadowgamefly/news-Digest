{"name": "682", "parent": "", "content": "Stuck in Unhappiness: How We Get There (And How to Get\u00a0Out) There\u2019s a story unhappy people tell themselves. This story\u200a\u2014\u200athis myth\u200a\u2014\u200ais a big reason why unhappy people stay unhappy. Let\u2019s look at a story I tell myself sometimes, from Theodore Zeldin\u2019s A Intimate History of Humanity: \u201c\u2026in the beginning everybody lived cosily in a family or tribe, people did not originally even know what loneliness was, never conceiving of themselves as separate individuals. Then suddenly, quite recently, togetherness crumbled. Now, not only is an epidemic of loneliness sweeping the world, hand in hand with prosperity, but the more successful you are, the more likely you are to suffer from it; and money cannot buy you out.\u201d Pretty convincing, yea? Part of me still believes it. Zeldin warns against this self-storytelling. If we believe happiness is an impossibility\u200a\u2014\u200aa long-dead artifact of ancient times\u200a\u2014\u200awhy search for it at all? Our belief defines our reality. Humans have always been unhappy at times. And, in each age, they have found a way to fight back. For another perspective on this matter, let\u2019s dig into the personal notebooks of Samuel Butler, written over 100 years ago: \u201cAt least one half of the misery which meets us daily might be removed or, at any rate, greatly alleviated, if those who suffer by it would think it worth their while to be at any pains to get rid of it.\u201d How We Get\u00a0Stuck How to be happy, says Butler, is not something they teach in school: \u201cOne can bring no greater reproach against a man than to say that he does not set sufficient value upon pleasure, and there is no greater sign of a fool than the thinking that he can tell at once and easily what it is that pleases him. To know this is not easy, and how to extend our knowledge of it is the highest and the most neglected of all arts and branches of education.\u201d In school, they taught us math. They taught us science. But, in my experience, nobody taught us how to live. It\u2019s not my goal to argue whether happiness is worth chasing\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s for you to decide. But if you do want to be happy, then it makes no sense to wait for it to come to you. There are reasons other than self-storytelling that make people unhappy. Butler shares one of them: \u201cOne reason why we find it so hard to know our own likings is because we are so little accustomed to try; we have our likings found for us in respect of by far the greater number of the matters that concern us; thus we have grown all our limbs on the strength of the likings of our ancestors and adopt these without question.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it happen. When people make effort to change themselves, they do. In the past, I would look down on those who didn\u2019t change, calling them \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d Lately, I realize it\u2019s not the case. People aren\u2019t lazy, they\u2019re just stuck, stuck in a whirlwind of habit and false belief. Without outside help, sometimes they\u2019ll never get out. Some things that might cause this: You, the reader, are lucky. If you\u2019re here reading this, it means you have the power, the agency, to direct change in your life. But how do we direct change? Butler has some ideas on that too\u2026 Getting to Happiness In his notebooks, Butler goes on to explain how to take control: \u201cTo those, however, who are desirous of knowing what gives them pleasure but do not quite know how to set about it I have no better advice to give than that they must take the same pains about acquiring this difficult art as about any other, and must acquire it in the same way\u200a\u2014\u200athat is by attending to one thing at a time and not being in too great a hurry.\u201d Sorry folks, no magic powder here. You can\u2019t buy happiness for three easy payments of $99.99. With that said, the process is simple (it\u2019s the doing that\u2019s hard). Learning how to be happy is not much different from, say, learning how to juggle. Challenge Assumptions First, Butler says to doubt your beliefs: \u201cAbove all things it is necessary here, as in all other branches of study, not to think we know a thing before we do know it\u200a\u2014\u200ato make sure of our ground and be quite certain that we really do like a thing before we say we do. When you cannot decide whether you like a thing or not, nothing is easier than to say so and to hang it up among the uncertainties.\u201d Or, put simply: Make sure you really like something before you say you do. Don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Get in the habit of looking at what you (and the people around you) believe to be true. Ask: \u201cDoes this really make me happy? How do I know?\u201d Test Drive Sometimes, no amount of armchair philosophy will get you to the right answer. In times like that, Butler recommends a test drive: \u201cOr when you know you do not know and are in such doubt as to see no chance of deciding, then you may take one side or the other provisionally and throw yourself into it. This will sometimes make you uncomfortable, and you will feel you have taken the wrong side and thus learn that the other was the right one. Sometimes you will feel you have done right. Any way ere long you will know more about it.\u201d Or, put simply: Can\u2019t decide? Pick something and try it. If it went well, maybe it\u2019s good. If it didn\u2019t, maybe it\u2019s bad. Keep going until you\u2019re sure. I thought AcroYoga was the silliest thing ever, a perversion of an ancient art. But when I tried it, it was really fun. I made up reasons not to like it, and none of them were true. Never marry someone a week after meeting them. The more serious the decision, the more you should in invest in getting it right. The Great Experiment If you think about it, what Butler is telling us is something we all knew already. He\u2019s telling us to: Sounds familiar? We learned it science class all those years ago. It\u2019s the scientific method. So here\u2019s the big takeaway for me. The how-to of life is not a science. But this does NOT mean we shouldn\u2019t apply methods of science to our lives. And, of course, no easy answers does not mean there are no answers at all. Maybe that stuff they taught us in school wasn\u2019t so useless after all. Want more?
