{"name": "352", "parent": "", "content": "The Heart Of The\u00a0Matter Sometimes all we need is another human being to be a compassionate witness to our wounds without judgement. I was in upstate New York for a retreat, a spiritual workshop. \u201cGet in, lady,\u201d the cab driver said to me. He had a rather unpleasant tone. After I told him my destination, he resumed ranting about his life with the other passenger, who commiserated with him the entire way. \u201cMy life sucks,\u201d I heard him say. \u201cNobody would believe how bad it sucks, and now I drive cabs for a living.\u201d He glanced in the rear view mirror and zeroed in on me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your story, lady?\u201d I had been looking out the window at the beautiful scenery. \u201cI don\u2019t have a story,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just here to enjoy the retreat.\u201d He dropped us off at the retreat office and sped off without a \u201cThank you\u201d or \u201cHave a good day.\u201d That evening, the same cab driver was waiting to pick me up. I slid into the back seat, energized from the day. Almost immediately, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a crappy day. I\u2019ve had to carry all these workshop people back and forth. And you know what? They aren\u2019t the nicest people. What phonies!\u201d When I didn\u2019t take the bait, he eyed me again through the rear view mirror. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d he prodded, determined to have a conversation. \u201cNorth Carolina,\u201d I replied and waited for whatever blast was to come. His eyes lit up instead. \u201cI was in the military, the Marines, and I was stationed in NC. I love that area.\u201d It was the first time I had heard anything positive come from his mouth. He was quiet for a moment and then ventured further. \u201cLife hands you a lot of crap. Being in the Marines, being on the ground, made me see how life really is. People are shitty. Nobody cares.\u201d I looked at this young guy; he couldn\u2019t have been out of his 20\u2019s. His face was already weathered, and his heart was already hard. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, too?\u201d he asked. Now he was earnestly studying me, waiting on an answer. \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel the same way. I feel we all have hearts; some are open, and some are closed. I can always see the highest good in anyone\u200a\u2014\u200ahuman or animal. I can always see their beauty inside.\u201d We rode the rest of the way in silence. The next day my cab driver friend showed up. He leaned over to the front passenger side, opened the door, and said, \u201cGet in front, please. I\u2019ve got other passengers to pick up.\u201d Great, I thought. Lucky me! A photo of a child who was maybe 2 or 3 hung from his rearview mirror. \u201cIs that your son?\u201d I asked. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe\u2019s mine. Don\u2019t get to see him much. Don\u2019t get to see him at all. Restraining order.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I answered softly. \u201cI bet you miss him.\u201d We rode for awhile in silence. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life, and I\u2019ve got two dogs,\u201d he offered. Then, as if he couldn\u2019t not tell me, he blurted out, \u201cI like to cook and create recipes, too. I watch Rachel Ray all the time.\u201d I had to smile. The door to his heart had cracked open. When he dropped me off, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m this nice to everyone. I kick people out of my cab every day.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said before I closed the door. \u201cEven if you kicked me out on the curb, I would still see your kind heart.\u201d The look on his face was priceless. On the last day, he took me to the train station. When we arrived, he unloaded my bags and told me to wait by the cab. I heard him go inside and talk to the train depot attendant. \u201cHey, Bill. Take good care of my friend.\u201d He didn\u2019t know I had heard it. When he came back out, I handed him the money for the ride. Shaking his head no, he pushed the money aside and said, \u201cThe ride\u2019s on me.\u201d Then, all of the sudden, he gave me a quick hug. \u201cYou\u2019d better go; your train is about here.\u201d He had a huge smile on his face. Of all the things I\u2019ll remember about that retreat, it will be James, the cab driver with an attitude, who stands out the most. The most spiritual part of the weekend was my experience with him. He may have been on the ground in the military, but we all are on the ground in our everyday lives, battling it out with life. Daily combat can harden us and close our hearts. Sometimes all we need is another human being to be a compassionate witness to our wounds without judgement. What reveals itself is a heart that can hold it all.
