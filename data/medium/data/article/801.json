{"name": "801", "parent": "", "content": "If Scale Isn\u2019t The Goal, Then What\u00a0Is? Seth Godin has a recent post titled \u201cWhat if scale wasn\u2019t the goal?\u201d. I\u2019ve posted the entirety of it below: From restaurants to direct mail, there\u2019s pressure to be scalable, to be efficient, to create something easily replicated. Which is often used as the reason it\u2019s not very good. \u201cWell, we\u2019d like to spend more time/more care/more focus on this, but we need to get bigger.\u201d What if you started in the other direction? What would happen if you created something noteworthy and worried about scale only after you\u2019ve figured out how to make a difference? The knee jerk reaction in tech, as both VCs and, often, as founder is to agonize how scalable something is long before it has proven noteworthy. A favorite reason for passing on an investment can be boiled down to \u201cI don\u2019t see how this can be a billion dollar business\u201d. I recently spoke with a founder who is working to answer the question at the heart of Seth\u2019s post. Giacomo \u2018Peldi\u2019 Guilizzoni is the founder of the wireframing software company, Balsamiq. Our chat covered a wide range of topics, but it was his answers to my questions specific to scale that departed so completely from the VC funded startup narrative. Peldi started Balsamiq nearly a decade ago. His intent was not be to it\u2019s founder or CEO, but to be it\u2019s only employee. Ever. Growth has never been a goal of ours. Our growth comes as a direct result of building a product customers love. We love talking with and listening to our customers. As their needs and challenges grow, our vision for how to support them grows\u00a0too. But if growth isn\u2019t the goal then what is? Our goal is to not mess it up! And to have good profit\u00a0margins. Unlike many founders who hit on something that\u2019s working then rush to raise funding to scale, Balsamiq has chosen to take a more measured approach- consistently growing revenue and profits year of over year. Each year Peldi takes $1M out personally, socks away 18mo of runway for a rainy day, and pays out 15% of profits to Balsamiq\u2019s 25 employees (this number grows by 2\u20133 new hires per year). Over the years, there has been plenty of pressure to scale, be it from waves of competitors (Peldi called 2011 their year of the Clone Wars\u2122) or VC\u2019s looking to use the company\u2019s massive user base as the foundation to roll up similar startups to dominate the category. To which Peldi says: Push us into prototyping tools? Design tools? Nope! Create a suite to go after Google Drive? Call InVision! All of those teams and all of those heavily funded strategies have to build complicated products so they can charge more. They can\u2019t stay simple and reach the scale they need to meet investor expectations. They have to go up market. We\u00a0don\u2019t. What hasn\u2019t Balsamiq been able to do without the support and resources that come from taking on outside investors? Sell. In 2010 we almost sold the business. I was freaking out. I didn\u2019t want to stop coding so I figured I needed to hire myself a boss or bring on someone to help me sell the business. Raising money to help me sell was very enticing. Problem was, everytime I let myself go there I couldn\u2019t sleep. I couldn\u2019t convince my team. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being a sellout. My head was saying \u201cYES!\u201d but every cell in my body was saying\u00a0\u201cNO!\u201d. Any regrets? None. I\u2019m my own boss. I don\u2019t have to answer to anyone. I get to learn from my own mistakes instead of being fired for making them. We have no debts and we have no deadlines. There\u2019s no pressure to take shortcuts, or please any outside shareholders. We get to spend our time in customer interviews not in board meetings. Back to Seth\u2019s original question then. If scale isn\u2019t the goal, then what is? I don\u2019t believe in the hustle. The goal for us as a company is finding a balance in our work and in our life. Extreme growth sounds way too stressful! We aren\u2019t some kids from the Bay Area Hacker News crowd hoping against hope to grab a winning lottery ticket. As a product person I want to spend the next 40\u201350yrs honing and perfecting this\u00a0craft. I\u2019m Italian. We measure things in generations, not quarters.
