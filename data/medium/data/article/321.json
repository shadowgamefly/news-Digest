{"name": "321", "parent": "", "content": "The Habits Of Unproductive People You Don\u2019t Want To\u00a0Copy The reason I study productivity is because I\u2019m an unproductive person. I truly am. I sleep too much. I talk too much. I read too much. I listen to music all day. I watch movies. I buy gadgets that turn me into a zombie. If it wasn\u2019t for my productivity system, get nothing done. I wouldn\u2019t even write this article. But if you browse social media, all you see is super productive, healthy, and wealthy people. Is that really the case? I don\u2019t know. I just know this: You can\u2019t be productive 24/7. And a big part of being productive is about getting rid of unproductive habits we all have. What follows is a list of ten unproductive habits that I learned to do less, or eliminate. Do you have a few of these habits? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re all unproductive at times. But if you have five or more, it might be time to change. One thing is sure: No one wants to be an unproductive person. Working Too\u00a0Much Some days I can work 12 or 13 hours straight. I just take a break for exercising and eating. And I can keep that up for a few days. But after a few days, there always comes a crash. Big time. I struggle. I can\u2019t get stuff done. I don\u2019 even want to get stuff done. It\u2019s not good. So I learned to be more calculated with how much I work. Hemingway tried to stop when he was going good. That\u2019s also my new goal. But that\u2019s hard because we always want things fast, fast, quick, quick, now, now. Just know yourself, your work, and your deadlines. Don\u2019t have a deadline? Take it easy because you need that juice for stressful times. And most importantly: Have patience. Worrying Too\u00a0Much What if I go broke? What if I lose my job? What if she doesn\u2019t love me? What if I get cancer? What if this plane crashes? What if I lose my sight? What if I\u2026? You got your head so far in the sand like an ostrich that you can\u2019t see how self-absorbed that way of thinking is. It\u2019s always about me, me, me. I know all about it. The above examples are all from my personal life. I used to be the king of the \u2018what if\u2019 game. But here\u2019s the thing: YOU\u2019RE NOT GOING TO DIE RIGHT THIS SECOND. Get over yourself. Stop worrying. And do something useful. (I know, it\u2019s not that simple, but still: You can learn how to stop worrying.) Being Stubborn We deal with people all the time. Do you ever think: \u201cWhy should I listen to this guy?\u201d Or: \u201cWhat does she know?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Maybe more than you do? We just don\u2019t know until we listen to others. But if you always think you\u2019re the best in the world, you never give people a chance. I think everyone is stubborn. Some are extreme, and some are just a little stubborn. I must say, stubbornness is also a good trait. It\u2019s good to be deaf to critics and not about care what people think. But being stubborn in relationships is plain frustrating. That kind of stubbornness is not good. And it just so happens to be that life is based on relationships. And your career too. So when you refuse to work with others, you\u2019re sabotaging everyone else that\u2019s involved. Just remember that. I try to remind myself often that stubbornness can be bad. But sometimes it\u2019s so bad I don\u2019t even listen to myself. But I keep trying. Checking Things What are you doing? \u201cI was just checking Facebook.\u201d What are you \u2018checking\u2019? Email? TMZ? CNN? NBA? NFL? Instagram? Twitter? Snapchat? Checking is not a useful thing. It might be a verb, but it\u2019s not a real action. When I started blogging, I always checked my stats for no reason. Then I thought: What\u2019s the outcome of checking? Nothing. You just consume information. I try to keep my \u2018checking\u2019 at a minimum. That\u2019s why deleted all news and social media apps on my phone. I don\u2019t even have email on my phone. Otherwise, I check it all the time. I don\u2019t want that. I only want to check my email when I have time to answer emails. Checking is a habit that you can never fully eliminate. I still follow the NBA because I like it. Pick only one or two \u2018checking\u2019 vices you actually like. Eliminate the rest. You\u2019re not missing anything anyway. Escaping Life Until two years ago, every time I\u2019d get stressed out, I said stuff like: \u201cI need a drink.\u201d Or: \u201cI have to go on a vacation.\u201d And when I had issues at work or in my relationship that became too much to handle, I preferred to pretend they didn\u2019t exist. Sometimes I would take some time to talk about it. But there are always deeper issues at play. Back then I didn\u2019t like my job, relationship, and the city I lived in. I basically didn\u2019t like my life. Did I change it? Nope. I always tried to escape my issues. Escaping problems gives you some stamina to face your shitty life again. But you and I both know that problems never go away until you grab them by the root and extinguish them. I learned that the hard way. These days I deal with problems before they become big problems. Saying Yes Most people are afraid to say no. Maybe you don\u2019t want to let people down. Maybe you are uncomfortable with the word no. I don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t matter, really. What matters is this: If you keep saying yes, you\u2019re living someone else\u2019s life. Think about it. Deep down, we all know that it\u2019s true. We\u2019re not even in control of our own time. Want to be in full control of your life? Say no to a million things and yes to a few things that matter. Not Writing Things\u00a0Down Yeah, yeah, you have the memory of an elephant. Or you\u2019re so smart that you remember everything, right? WRONG. Not writing down your thoughts, ideas, tasks, etc, is stupid. Why? Because you\u2019re wasting a lot of brain power when you rely on your memory. When you write everything down, you can use your brainpower for other things. Like solving problems. That\u2019s actually useful and advances your career. If you journal, that\u2019s even better. But I\u2019ve found that not everyone likes the idea of journaling. So let\u2019s just call it \u2018writing things down.\u2019 What did you write down while you\u2019re reading this article? Being Hard On\u00a0Yourself \u201cI suck!\u201d No, you don\u2019t. \u201cWhy?\u201d You got out of bed this morning, right? \u201cYeah.\u201d Congratulations. You survived this fucking hard thing called LIFE. Be proud of yourself. Everything you do after getting out of bed is a win. Neglecting Your Personal Education \u201cWoohoo! I finished college. Goodbye lame old books!\u201d If that was you, no matter how long ago, you DO suck. Who learns one thing and stops forever? I don\u2019t even know why we have that idea planted in our brain. I always thought that learning stops when you get out of school. But the truth is: Your life stops when learning stops. Invest in yourself. Learn something. Read books. Get courses. Watch videos. Do it from home or go places. It doesn\u2019t matter. Just learn new things. You\u2019ll be more productive and more excited about life. Hating Rules I saved the best for last. Most people hate rules, right? It starts when we\u2019re kids. \u201cWhy do I have to do this? Why do I have to do that?\u201d Because it\u2019s better for you! That\u2019s why! (you weird kid) But when we\u2019re adults, we don\u2019t have to follow rules (other than actual rules set by the government, but you get what I\u2019m talking about.) \u201cRules are dumb!\u201d That\u2019s what I always believed. I thought I was a maverick. But I was an idiot. Rules are actually THE BEST thing about life. Without rules, we would be hot dog eating pigs right now. And when it comes to productivity, the first rule is: Have rules. If you want to live without rules, go ahead. But life is not Fight Club. Rules actually help us to solve problems and get the most out of life. Josh Weltman, an advertising creative director for 25+ years, and the co-producer of Mad Men, put it well in his book Seducing Strangers: \u201cSolving a problem requires a weird combination of freedom and constraint. Whenever I hear \u201cJust have fun with it\u201d or \u201cThink outside the box,\u201d I know from experience that things are about to turn into a colossal waste of\u00a0time.\u201d Good news: You make up the\u00a0rules. For example, one of my personal rules is this: Never complain. Another one is: Read and exercise every day. And: Close the day every evening by setting your next day\u2019s priorities. When you combine all your productivity rules, you have a system. Voila! And a system changes everything. I rely on my system to work smarter, better, happier, and effectively. It took me years to figure out that a system is a good thing, and a few more years to create one, but it was worth it. Because now, I get to be a productive person. Not bad for an unproductive person, huh? Thanks for reading! This article was originally published on dariusforoux.com.
