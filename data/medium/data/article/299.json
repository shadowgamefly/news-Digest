{"name": "299", "parent": "", "content": "The Ultimate Guide to Achieving Big\u00a0Goals Do you have big goals you long to achieve? Do you promise yourself someday you\u2019ll get started? Someday you\u2019ll make it happen? Someday the time will be right? There\u2019s an old Chinese proverb that says, \u201cThe best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.\u201d In this post, you\u2019re going to learn a wholistic approach for achieving big goals. If you\u2019ve tried before and failed, chances are you were missing a crucial ingredient for success. This post will give you a well-rounded framework to follow. Better than that, I\u2019m going to help you plan out your goal on a handy notecard so you can stay focused and motivated. (Shoutout to my bookkeeper Alex Hubenthal, who inspired this notecard method). So grab a notecard or cut one from a piece of cardstock paper. Then write today\u2019s date in the top right corner. It should look something like this: Step 1: Identify\u00a0what. If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.\u200a\u2014\u200aChinese Proverb. When I first launched my blog, I remember spending three hours writing the about page. I scolded myself thinking, \u201cWhat is wrong with you, Kyle? How are a few hundred words taking you THREE HOURS to write?\u201d That\u2019s when the epiphany hit me. The reason I spent three hours writing an about page for my blog\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what my blog was about. I thought I knew. I certainly had a general idea. But when it came time to put something specific in writing, I realized I wasn\u2019t quite clear. Chances are, you\u2019re bumping into a similar problem in pursuit of your goals. You have a general idea of what you want, but you still need to pinpoint it. Maybe you think \u201cI want to be a writer.\u201d But that\u2019s hardly a goal. Do you want to write a poem, a book, or a blog? Fiction or non? The questions go on and on. Knowing what you want is the first step to achieving it. Skip this step and you have nowhere to go. So take the time to really ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I want to accomplish?\u201d Make sure your goal is specific enough that you\u2019ll know the moment you succeed. Exercise: On the front of your notecard, write exactly what you want to accomplish using the following template: \u201cBy [INSERT BLANK SPACE] I will have [WRITE YOUR GOAL].\u201d Your notecard should look something like this: Step 2. Identify\u00a0when. A goal is a dream with a deadline.\u200a\u2014\u200aNapoleon Hill Think about the goal you just identified. How long have you wanted to accomplish it? Chances are, if it\u2019s a big goal, you\u2019ve been wanting it for years. You\u2019ve had the desire but lacked a clear deadline. Pick a date that is both realistic and challenging. Too little time will tempt you to give up. Too much time will invite you to slack off. Pro tip: When you\u2019re setting a deadline for a goal, don\u2019t pick December 31st unless that\u2019s really the intersection of realistic and challenging. I got my date by dividing my goal of 50 posts into two posts per week (25 weeks) and finding that date on the calendar. Exercise: On your notecard, fill in the space you left for the date. It should look something like this: Step 3. Identify\u00a0how. Successful people are simply those with successful habits.\u200a\u2014\u200aBrian Tracy Even with a deadline, a goal without a plan is doomed to fail. And the only thing worse than no plan\u2026is a complicated plan. Before you start chasing a big goal, you should identify the key habits you\u2019ll need to succeed. Limit yourself to two or three. For example, if your goal is to become a popular blogger, writing weekly or bi-weekly is a habit you might consider. When you\u2019re chasing a big goal, the kind of goal that takes months or years to accomplish, your biggest enemy will be complacency\u200a\u2014\u200aletting days go by without any forward motion. The single best strategy to set yourself up for daily progress is routine. And the #1 hack for creating routine is called Implementation Intentions. At least, that\u2019s what researchers, call it. I prefer my friend Lonnie\u2019s label: The When/Then Strategy. The When/Then Strategy establishes new routines by building them onto existing routines. Think about the activities you do daily. You get out of bed, brush your teeth, eat meals. You might go to work or drive your kids to school. These are all habits you never break, and the When/Then Strategy builds on this solid foundation. For example, if your goal is to write a book, you might resolve, \u201cWHEN I finish putting the kids to bed THEN I\u2019ll write for half an hour.\u201d Or, WHEN I\u2019m driving to work every morning THEN I\u2019ll listen to a book or podcast about writing. The When/Then Strategy helps you form routines that fend off inactivity. Exercise: Write your #1 When/Then on the bottom half of your card. Pick a routine that is so fundamental to your success it deserves your top priority. It should look something like this: Step 4: Identify\u00a0where. There is no problem that doesn\u2019t have some underlying need for more optimism, stamina, resilience and collaboration. And games are, I believe, the best platform we have for providing that. \u2014Jane McGonigal Progress sparks momentum. And to persevere in the pursuit of big goals, you\u2019ll need momentum on your side. One reason games like Angry Birds are so addictive is the pride you feel after beating a level and moving forward to the next one. You can harness some of this addictive energy by breaking your goal into levels. Deciding where you\u2019ll pause to celebrate on your journey to success. For example, if your goal is to write a book, your milestones might be the different chapters you\u2019ll need to write. If your goal is to build an email list, the milestones might be 100 subscribers, 250 subscribers, 500 subscribers, etc. What you don\u2019t want is an all-or-nothing scenario, where you\u2019ve failed until you finally win. Small wins build confidence and strengthen your odds of success. But these crucial victories will slip by unnoticed unless you watch for them. Where will you pause to celebrate? Exercise: Plot out 4\u20135 milestones for your goal on the bottom of your note card. The bigger the goal, the more milestones you should have. Include your start date at the beginning and your deadline at the end. It should look something like this: Step 5: Identify\u00a0why. The secret of our success is that we never, never give up.\u2014 Wilma Mankiller The key to motivation is simple\u2026 Always have more than one reason to keep going. Imagine driving home from work and experiencing an intense craving for something salty. What foods might you stop and buy? You could grab chips, peanuts, french fries, chicken nuggets\u2026the list goes on an on. But what if you were craving something salty, warm, soft, toasted, and bready? You\u2019d need to find a pretzel. Chips, fries, peanuts\u200a\u2014\u200anone of that would satisfy your craving because none of those foods have all the ingredients you\u2019re looking for. My point is this: When you have only one motivator, you\u2019re set up to fail. Because there will be myriad substitutes to scratch that itch than working hard towards your goal. You\u2019ll find easier ways to make money than launching a business. You\u2019ll find easier ways to help others than founding a charity. You\u2019ll find easier ways to be creative than writing an entire novel. But when you\u2019re craving an accomplishment driven by a unique recipe of motivators, your goal will have no rivals. In other words\u2026 Don\u2019t crave salt. Crave pretzels. Exercise: On the back of your card, split the card with a vertical line, and on the left side write 5 reasons you\u2019re motivated to hit your goal. Pro tip: Think about how your life will improve after you succeed. What skills will you learn? What opportunities will you create? How will your success help the people you love? What will you miss out on if you quit too soon? Your note card should look like this: Step 6: Identify\u00a0Who. Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble [\u2026] A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer...\u200a\u2014\u200aEcclesiastes 4:9\u201310,12 NLT If you want to minimize your odds of success, chase your goal alone. Trust me. I\u2019ve tried. You need the support, accountability, and advice of friends to persevere in pursuit of your goal. Currently, if I run into trouble, I have roughly 17 people I can call for help and encouragement. These friends cheer me on when I\u2019m stuck, coach me when I\u2019m lost, and celebrate with me when I reach new milestones. I feel incredibly blessed to have so many amazing men and women supporting me. And I realize not everyone can relate. But the point I\u2019m driving home is you need a community. You need to find and help people who will help you in return. And when you feel like you have enough people on your team, go find a few more. You\u2019ll need all of them. I promise. Exercise: Write down the names of 3\u20135 people you can call when you get stuck or need support. Your card should look like this: Step 7: Make a commitment Now you have a game plan for achieving big goals that have eluded you in the past. This system has brought me great results so I wanted to share it with you. I keep my notecard on my nightstand so I can read it out loud every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to bed. You should try it too. This simple ritual keeps me focused and reminds me that I have the power to work for what I want. I don\u2019t have to surrender my dreams to my doubts. Final exercise: Join me in assembling a diverse community of people who dream big dreams and work hard to achieve them. Want to go\u00a0deeper? Do you have big goals you long to achieve?
