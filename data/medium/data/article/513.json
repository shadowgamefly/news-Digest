{"name": "513", "parent": "", "content": "Writing When You Feel Overwhelmed Already I have a busy day today. Well, long, anyway. 5 hours of driving, 3 appointments. A ton of tasks to complete. While that might not seem like much, taking out 5 hours of the day compresses the rest, and makes everything 100x more stressful. Whenever I\u2019m stressed, I often feel overwhelmed. As if the tasks will never get done. My work usually suffers (ironically). And yet, I\u2019m sitting here at 4am writing my Medium post. It\u2019s very easy to tell people you\u2019re too busy to write. I\u2019d love to write a novel, I just wish I had the\u00a0time I told people for ages that I wanted to write a novel. I still have an empty manuscript staring at me from my desktop. It\u2019s never getting done. But that\u2019s not because I don\u2019t have the time. It\u2019s because it\u2019s not important to me. Writing my daily Medium post is very important to me. Maybe not to anyone else, but to me it\u2019s a huge part of my life now. So I make the time for it. Maybe I\u2019ll do one less task today because I\u2019m writing this now, but to me that\u2019s worth it. So really, when you\u2019re telling people you\u2019re too busy to write, you\u2019re actually telling them you don\u2019t care. You have time. Everyone has the same amount of hours. You just don\u2019t want to write more than you want to do everything else. As soon as you really want to\u2014to the exclusion of other tasks\u2014you\u2019ll find the time. I\u2019m just a guy from the UK that\u2019s okay at writing, better at startups, awesome at making coffee. This is day 35 in a 365 day writing experiment. You can check out why I\u2019m writing every day here. If you enjoyed this post, let me know by hitting the heart. Or send me a tweet or an email.
