{"name": "1524", "parent": "", "content": "139 lawmakers support Trump\u2019s refugee ban and also support bombing\u00a0Syria Most of them said they supported the bombing for humanitarian reasons. By Adrienne Mahsa Varkiani, Laurel Raymond, Diana Ofosu, and Joshua Eaton Last week, President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian airbase after Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad killed civilians with chemical weapons. The Turkish health ministry, after examining victims of the Assad regime\u2019s attack, confirmed that it was carried out with the banned nerve agent Sarin. Syrian Opposition health officials and humanitarian groups on the ground estimated the death toll at 70\u2013100 people. Many of the dead were children. Trump cited their deaths repeatedly while explaining his decision to attack the Assad regime. \u201cAssad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many,\u201d he said, according to press pool reports. \u201cEven beautiful babies were cruelly murdered at this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.\u201d The president ordered the attack from Mar-A-Lago, his private club in Florida, and could not stream his comments due to technical restrictions. But Trump\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like the lawmakers now publicly praising his decision to retaliate against Assad\u200a\u2014\u200ahas not always displayed this level of concern for the people suffering over the course of Syria\u2019s six-year war. Trump has tried, twice, to stop Syrians from entering the United States. In the first version of his Muslim ban executive order, he temporarily suspended visas for Syrian citizens and suspended Syrian refugee resettlement indefinitely. After that ban was struck down by the courts, he tried once more, again suspending visas and refugee resettlement for Syrians. Trump apparently doesn\u2019t see a contradiction between condemning Assad\u2019s brutality and turning away those who flee it. And he\u2019s not the only one. Many lawmakers in Congress rushed to condemn Assad\u2019s latest attack and applaud Trump\u2019s action\u200a\u2014\u200awhile also supporting Trump\u2019s proposal to ban all Syrian refugees from the United States. ThinkProgress reviewed the statements of every member of Congress to gather their previous statements on Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, as well as their recent responses to the Sarin attack and Trump\u2019s retaliatory airstrikes. 139 members of Congress expressed support for at least one version of Trump\u2019s ban as well as for his airstrikes on the Assad regime\u2019s al-Shayrat airbase last week. An additional 28 members of Congress did not make clear statements on Trump\u2019s ban, but supported his airstrikes. The vast majority of those who applauded the bombings did so as a measured response to a humanitarian tragedy, and did not acknowledge the hypocrisy in simultaneously backing a ban on refugees fleeing a war zone. Take Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL), who tweeted this on Thursday: But when Trump proposed to ban Syrian refugees\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding those babies and children \u2014Ross called it \u201clong overdue.\u201d Or Rep. Steve Knight (R-CA), who said in a statement last Thursday that \u201ctime and again, Bashar al-Assad has proven to be monstrously cruel to his own people. This recent sarin gas attack is further evidence that his disregard for international law and human decency has no place in the modern world.\u201d In January, Knight came out in support of Trump\u2019s ban. And in 2015, when President Obama proposed increasing the United States\u2019 intake of Syrian refugees, Knight called it an \u201cexistential\u201d question that went against \u201cthe best interest of the American people.\u201d Rep. Jacki Walorski (R-IN), tweeted that \u201ctonight\u2019s U.S. military airstrikes on targets in Syria send a clear message that America will not stand for such atrocities.\u201d In 2015, she commended then-Governor Mike Pence for suspending the resettlement of Syrian refugees to Indiana. There\u2019s also Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), who tweeted Friday morning, \u201cThe United States sent a clear message that we will not tolerate the slaughter of innocent citizens by the Assad regime.\u201d While defending the Muslim ban on CNN in January, he specifically called it the \u201cSyria ban.\u201d ThinkProgress only looked at members of Congress who supported or did not make clear statements condemning Trump\u2019s ban on refugees. Both versions of his ban call for a 120 day suspension of all refugee resettlement, as well as a 90 day ban on visas for Syrian nationals. We focused on the responses to Trump\u2019s recent ban, because while the courts have temporarily halted the latest ban, it may still become reality. The number of Congress members who have previously expressed broad support for halting Syrian refugees and also supported Trump\u2019s recent airstrikes is likely far higher. In 2015, 289 Representatives voted to toughen the already rigorous screening for refugees from Iraq and Syria. Under the bill, refugees would only be allowed to enter the country if the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence all agreed that a refugee posed no threat to the United States, which would make entry nearly impossible. The bill\u2019s supporters included 47 Democrats, and vocal backers of Assad, like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI). A number of Senators, including Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), also expressed support for the tougher screening progress. Many of these members of Congress also expressed support for Trump\u2019s airstrikes in Syria. Speaking to press in Mar-A-Lago last Thursday, Sean Spicer attempted to reconcile Trump\u2019s stance on Syrian refugees with his framing of the attack on Assad as humanitarian, saying that Trump supports setting up \u201csafe zones\u201d so that Syrians can safely stay in their country. Trump has never given details as to how he would actually set up such safe zones, nor has he made them a policy priority for his administration. His administration\u2019s foreign policy approach towards Syria is still largely incoherent, and he is still looking to ban Syrian refugees from the United States.
