Consider what your target audience wants and needs out of life and how your product can help them.

Focus on\u00a0Benefits While you should keep solutions in mind when writing your content, you\u2019ll generally see better results by focusing on the benefits that your product offers.

Inserting a few quotes throughout your copy are recommended. You may also want to include Amazon reviews or other consumer reviews if at all possible.

Remember, your customers likely have limited time available to read your content. If they feel like they have to analyze a scholarly essay, they won\u2019t be interested.
