That experience changed my life not because it was my first experience of suffering nor because her suffering was beyond anything I\u2019ve ever experienced before. It changed my life because I realized that in the face of all the suffering and all the sorrow in this cold, harsh world there was something I could do. I could help. I could make an actual difference in someone\u2019s life. I could be a friend. In our day and age, there are solutions for almost every\u00a0problem. But there are problems that the internet, technology, and money cannot\u00a0solve. These are problems that take root in the depths of our hearts that don\u2019t seem to have a solution. They are the deeper hurts and personal problems which remain, boiling up and growing and causing stress till we can\u2019t take it anymore. That lady\u2019s problem was one of these. But she didn\u2019t know where to find the solution. And where do we go when we don\u2019t know where to go? We know where a lot of people go: the bottle, the pills, sex, partying, jobs, TV, entertainment, you name it. All of us have our anesthesia. But these do not solve the problem. They only numb it, letting it grow even bigger and more unbearable as time passes. Because they don\u2019t address our hearts\u2019 unspoken plea: Not for a solution. Not for a pill. Not for a tip. But for a person. An open ear. A listening heart. A friend. That day, I realized that often that\u2019s the secret to suffering. And it was something that I could\u00a0give. Sometimes, when life gets us down and we hurt deep inside, all we want is a friend, someone to be there for us, who really cares, who doesn\u2019t want our money or what we can give, but who is there for us, to support us, to struggle through life with us. And this is what money cannot buy. You. Me. The person next to you. Without a friend, we cannot live. But there\u2019s good news: no matter who you are, no matter where you\u2019re from or your personal experience, friendship is a gift that you can give. It\u2019s something more precious than a new car, the latest gadget, or a seven-figure income. Something that we can\u2019t live without, yet at times so hard to find. Something that is free yet takes so much from us. Something so simple, yet so hard to understand. Something that makes us happy, that helps us go on day after day, that helps us live our lives in the best way that we can. Something that you can give without losing anything. Something that can change a life and make it worth living. Something that can fill an empty void in our heart. Something that might not solve the problems, but helps us work through them. It\u2019s that simple, free, little, and essential gift called friendship. That day, I learned something simple about suffering:\u00a0I can do something about it. The question is: Will\u00a0You?
