{"name": "1076", "parent": "", "content": "9 Dying Instagram Trends That Are Dragging You\u00a0Down By Sandra Iakovleva, Content Marketing Manager at Depositphotos Previously, we\u2019ve talked about tips that could help you improve your instagram game. Just as it is important knowing what to do, it\u2019s good to know what not to. Instagram is an incredible platform that is also rewarding but you need a little bit of background knowledge to succeed. It has been around for a while now and here are some of the lessons we\u2019ve learned and 9 trends that are definitely no longer\u00a0\u2018in\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t photograph in this style, but do understand that they\u2019re outdated trends and you should be a little more innovative if you want to increase your following and improve your feed. This article also contains some of the top Clashot photographs to give you more ideas on what to photograph and what is trending right now. 1. Collages Posting a collage with 12 perfect shots of sunsets, food, drinks etc. is no longer a trend. We have the option of posting multiple images in one post which tells you this is no longer relative. Collages can quickly become tacky and that\u2019s the last thing anyone wants. Try this instead: You can take a series of photographs instead of a collage and upload them as 1 post. Street photography is becoming increasingly popular which is another theme to explore. 2. Follow\u00a0me The only account that can pull this off is Murad Osmann. His account has made it into a signature image and all other copycat styles just don\u2019t reach the bar. The photographs others take are a little cheesy and no longer valid as a trend. Try this instead: Show something unusual\u200a\u2014\u200aphotograph street life and other creative spaces. Everyday is such a great opportunity to explore creative angles and photograph new subjects. 3. Smug photos of\u00a0food These, and also random pictures of food are just a big no-no now. There are accounts that put all their efforts into food photography but they are artistic, well thought out shots. Random pictures of food have people rolling their eyes. Unless you can find a new twist to it, you have to stop. Another pet peeve is posting pictures of unappetizing food. If you\u2019re going there, at least make it presentable! Try this instead: Experiment with minimalism if you are going to take food photographs. Architecture and candid moments of everyday life is another great area to venture into. 4. Outfit of the\u00a0day Unless you\u2019re a celebrity with a wardrobe the size of your apartment, chances are your images will not be appreciated in the way you intend them to be. This trend is getting old especially when the shots are from your perspective looking at your feet. Try this instead: Photographs taken from unconventional angles are much more interesting. Take pictures of DIY things and experiment with composition and flat lay. 5. Inspirational quotes I\u2019m sure that most Instagram feeds are full of these motivational, inspirational, cheesy phrases. Quotes are nice, but their days are numbered. One thing you\u2019ll notice with all these trends is that if you don\u2019t take it up a notch, it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re dead. You can find other ways to inspire people or at least give your quotes an artistic touch. See Depositphotos\u2019 inspirational quotes on Facebook. Try this instead: Compose inspirational images that show thought and have deeper meanings. 6. Next level\u00a0hashtags More than any of the other dying trends, this one is just annoying. If you\u2019re taking a picture at the beach and feel the need to basically hashtag your hashtags (#breakfast #delicious #photooftheday #yum #heaven #bliss #food #ilovefood #foodie), you\u2019re falling in the trap of extreme hashtagging. Be more thoughtful and creative, keep it relevant and minimal. Try this instead: Tone down on the hashtags, think in metaphors and put more thought into your tags or if you\u2019re hungry for followers\u200a\u2014\u200aTagsForLikes. 7. Throwback Thursday Don\u2019t get me wrong, throwback Thursdays are fun but it\u2019s another thing when it is taken advantage of and abused. I\u2019m talking about spamming streams with endless pictures of yourself as a kid and combining that with \u2018next level hashtags\u2019. There is a time and place for baby pictures, and it\u2019s not Instagram in 2017. Try this instead: Thursday? Post something more fitting that will speak to people in a universal language. 8. Gym\u00a0selfies Everyone gets it, you work out\u200a\u2014\u200agood job! Some things should be kept to yourself. Since we\u2019re on the topic, if you\u2019re working out, do it for yourself. You\u2019re not working out to impress anyone. It\u2019s about your wellbeing and everyone is happy for you but we don\u2019t want to see a million gym selfies in mirrors. You\u2019re also probably making people that came to actually work out a little uncomfortable. Try this instead: Focus on someone other than yourself. Take photographs of people on the streets, doing their job and going about their daily lives. 9. Fisheye\u00a0shots There was a time when fisheye lenses were cool, but 2017 has brought us with so many great trends that this one is kind of a bore! I think it is safe to say that we don\u2019t see these very often anymore (and for good reasons). Try this instead: Taking authentic photographs, action shots and images that show movement.
