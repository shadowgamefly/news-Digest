They had outdated ideas about how they wanted to run their marketing campaign. The young man told them their ideas were horrible. He was a marketing expert and had a crystal clear vision in his head of what they should do. But when he tried to articulate it to the group of older businessmen\u2026 they stonewalled him. It was maddening. Here he was, telling them how he\u2019d succeeded,, and no one was listening. They scoffed at every idea he brought up. The young man grew angry and didn\u2019t back down.

Nobody told them what to do, but here was this young guy who wasn\u2019t just telling\u2026 he was yelling. The young man\u2019s tirade paused when a stern hand fell on his shoulder. It was the founder of the non-profit who had invited him to speak and accepted his donation. He told the young man to shut up and leave Crestfallen, he walked out into the foggy California morning and sank into the seat of his car. He broke down crying. A few minutes later, the founder of the non-profit walked out. The founder watched, dumbfounded, as the young man sobbed over his steering wheel.
