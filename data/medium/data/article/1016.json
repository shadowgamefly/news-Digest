{"name": "1016", "parent": "", "content": "Why I\u2019m done making wireframes! And maybe you should be\u00a0too Let me start by saying I make products, digital ones that frequently include lots of interaction. I\u2019m not creating marketing sites or projects that require traditional information architecture and content structure. Meaning everything that follows is from an \u201capp\u201d perspective. Lately, I\u2019ve been struggling with the role of UX inside the confines of traditional Agile iterations. As I work to provide my team and larger organization with the answers they need, wireframes have always been the obvious \u201cgo to\u201d deliverable. After all, it\u2019s easy to just draw some boxes that represent a screen, then assume everyone who sees it is on the same page. Unfortunately, just because something\u2019s obvious doesn\u2019t make it right. Wireframes are time-consuming to create especially at higher fidelity but seem to be providing less and less value. \u201cLess value!?!\u201d you say, \u201cbut they\u2019re what UX designer\u2019s do!\u201d Fine, here are my gripes with wireframes. Maybe you\u2019ll agree. The purpose is\u00a0murky Why do we need a wireframe? In the context of a product, wireframes serve a similar function to that of a specification. But in my experience, it\u2019s common for both a formal spec and a wireframe to exist. These two items are often created by different individuals representing slightly different expectations. Unfortunately, the audience often assumes that spec and wireframe are in complete agreement. Since pictures are faster to digest than words, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of looking at wireframes without engaging with the spec. This results in errors or unexpected gotcha\u2019s in the final product. Wireframes aren\u2019t really\u00a0Agile An iterative process is the foundation of most product development methodologies. Wireframes like any artifact can (and should be) changed as learning occurs. However, since wireframes are often treated as spec they lend themselves to a Waterfall expectation as the \u201csource of truth\u201d. In other words, the wireframe is supposed to represent having everything figured out. Then when a wireframe does change, its extremely difficult to comprehend what\u2019s different. There are plenty of tools to help figure that stuff out (revision history, diffs, etc) but the reality is that most teams don\u2019t utilize them and work gets out of sync. Interaction states inflate complexity Do you ever get asked what a screen looks like? If the thing you\u2019re building forces you to follow up with \u201cIn what state or condition?\u201d, it\u2019s a sure sign that wireframing all those variations is going to be really complex. In general, the more interaction or types of content in an app the more versions of a screen will be required. Do you really want to wireframe each of those? Worse are you even remotely confident that you know all the states? Five wireframes for a single screen isn\u2019t overly sustainable let alone 20 or more. Wireframes aren\u2019t exactly\u00a0testable I\u2019ve yet to receive really valuable feedback by testing a wireframe. The experience is always a bit confusing. I spend so much time setting up concepts that I wonder how much bias I\u2019ve created which in turn causes me to question the feedback. Plus testing a wireframe doesn\u2019t provide much in the way of emotional and contextual feedback. Is it obvious that content is connected if you didn\u2019t see a card flip over? Sure wireframes are helpful for understanding a flow but they\u2019re often so detailed that it\u2019s hard to focus viewers on the right discussions. So yeah, I\u2019m done making wireframes. The ROI just isn\u2019t there for the type of things I make. Plus I\u2019m sick of wasting my time on stuff that seems to break the process. If not wireframes then\u00a0what? Ok, you got me. I\u2019m not trying to do less work. I simply want to be efficient with my time to provide the most valuable output possible. Instead of basking in my new found free time I need a different deliverable. So how do I replace wireframes? To be honest I\u2019m not entirely sure. I\u2019m going to try providing storyboards (similar to a movie) showing the interplay between screens and clickable prototypes. Both deliverables are much more collaborative, easier to test & discuss, and add context that might be missing from the spec. I have no idea if those things will be accepted by my team but there\u2019s little lost by trying. What about you? How do you provide direction to your team in valuable and meaningful terms? If you like this, please tap the heart or share it with others. If you take issue with something I\u2019ve said, leave a comment or response so we can discuss.
