John McCain on Tuesday criticized his GOP colleagues\u2019 hypocrisy CREDIT: CNN\u2019s New\u00a0Day Lacking the 60 votes required for cloture, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) plans to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee this week using a procedure that he himself once decried as breaking the rules to change the rules. While he can circumvent the 60-vote requirement with a simple majority, at least one member of his caucus is not on board with the maneuver. Though he said Monday that he would vote with McConnell for the move, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said Tuesday that his party is doing something terrible. Asked by CNN\u2019s New Day Alisyn Camerota whether he was comfortable with his party\u2019s plan to invoke the so-called \u201cnuclear option.\u201d He responded bluntly that he was not. \u201cI think it\u2019s a dark day in the history of the United States Senate,\u201d he lamented, though he said he expects it is going to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Republicans were dead set against it when my former colleague Harry Reid invoked it with the judges, but now it seems to be okay.\u201d The Arizona Republican then observed that lowering the threshold now will have long-term ramifications for the Senate. \u201cIf you can do this with 51 votes, what do you think the next nominee is going to be like? What do you think will happen when eventually Democrats are in majority in the senate? That\u2019s doing to happen sooner rather than later. I hope later.\u201d Watch: McCain\u2019s past comments also starkly conflict with his willingness to vote for this now. In 2013, when Senate Democrats used the same process to change the threshold for lower court judges to 51 votes, he denounced it as a \u201cbreathtaking\u201d breach of Senate rules, slamming then Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) as \u201cunwilling to accept the process.\u201d After his party won back the majority in 2014, McCain said the 60 vote threshold should be absolutely restored, or else voters should \u201cdisregard every bit of complaint that we made, not only after they did it but also during the campaign.\u201d And in 2015, he said it would be \u201csheer hypocrisy\u201d for Republicans to keep the 51 vote rule. \u201cWe said this was outrageous what they did,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only how they did it, but what they did, OK? Some of my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten that. Some selective amnesia.\u201d But it\u2019s hardly the first time McCain said one thing and did another. He was the deciding vote against the DISCLOSE Act in 2010, even while denouncing Citizens United as the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cworst decision ever.\u201d And after suggesting he in January that would only support Rex Tillerson\u2019s nomination to be Secretary of State when \u201cpigs fly,\u201d he ended up voting for his confirmation a few weeks later. With a 52 vote majority and Vice President Mike Pence available to break any ties, McConnell can lose no more than two members of his caucus on any vote to change this rule (no Democrats are expected to go along with his gambit). McConnell has indicated that he will have the votes, promising that \u201cJudge Gorsuch is gonna be confirmed\u201d this week.
