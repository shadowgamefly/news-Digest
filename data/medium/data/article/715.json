{"name": "715", "parent": "", "content": "Designing for Brand Interaction Finding inspiration, developing a point of view, and looking ahead at the ever-changing role of the UX\u00a0designer A few years ago, I started to evaluate the topic of motion design. It was at a point in time where UX designers were stuck designing in static comps, drowning in annotations, and the primary tool we had on hand only offered us simple, clickable transitions. I knew that motion design was important to our role, but wasn\u2019t quite sure how to approach it. After immersing myself in dozens of examples of how motion was being used in digital, I began to see a pattern in the ways it could be used in distinct moments. I started to better understand how motion can help us better communicate in a UI, help with cognitive load, make a UI feel tangible and realistic, and overall create a more polished experience. I formed the Principles of UX Choreography with the goal of coming up with some sort a reference that designers could use to help us know when, why, and how to use motion. UX designers have made tremendous progress in the past year or two. There are dozens of prototyping tools at our disposal which are far more integrated and easy to pick up, and therefor easier to integrate into workflow. It\u2019s been amazingly helpful to see many other designers sharing advice and best practices on the topic of motion design, and now there are so many more best-in-class examples to learn from. All in all, I feel like designers have established a better sense of awareness for designing for motion and interaction. So keep doing what you\u2019re doing! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb The need for\u00a0identity With this progress forward in prototyping with motion comes one con: the lack of a distinct brand identity across interactions. There are so many out-of-the-box transitions now at our disposal and we often get stuck referencing the same great examples over and over\u2026it\u2019s easy to just mimic what\u2019s already out there and working for others. It is becoming increasingly important for designers and brands to give closer consideration to the branded interaction we are creating in order to create distinction and identity. Personally, this same theme also started to emerge after spending time integrating the Principles of UX Choreography into my workflow and continuing to evaluate any experience I interact with. I started to see a bit of hierarchy to the principles, mainly the importance of beginning with Brand Tone of Voice and establishing a point of view on a \u201ccharacter\u2019s\u201d behavior and tone upfront. Doing so helps establish cohesion, rationale, and communication among teams (more on this later). Similar to how creative teams establish tone of voice for copy and visual guidelines for color, typography, imagery, and iconography, the same level of thought is needed behind interaction. In this article, the topics I\u2019ll cover\u00a0include: If a brand were to speak to us, what would it say? If a brand were to move, what would it feel\u00a0like? Making motion & interaction ownable What makes one service better than the next? And what even makes one feel unique from the rest? In addition to making the products and services we design intuitive, simple, and enjoyable, we have to evaluate what is relevant, authentic, and true for brands. True, opening up to see a view of cars nearby seems like the most obvious and appropriate solution. But which of these experiences has truly evaluated what makes their service distinct and ownable from the rest? How does that translate in the UI? Kudos to Uber for recently rethinking the experience from the ground up with their work on\u00a0trips. Branded motion and interaction are extra levels of detail that can influence an experience and a user\u2019s perception of your brand and product. Though this article is primarily focusing on motion, now more than ever, users are able to engage with brands across dozens of different touch-points that didn\u2019t exist before: bots, VR, voice-controlled experiences, Slack extensions\u2026 the list will only continue to go on. Motion, and screens in general, are just one part of the equation. Users expect to have the same level of service no matter where they are. They\u2019ll expect a brand to stay consistent too. In order to ensure consistency and authenticity, teams must develop a grounded point of view for how their brands should behave, what unique value their service or product brings, and the feelings they want their users to have while they engage. When should we be thinking about a brand\u2019s motion and how do we\u00a0start? The quick answer: right at the beginning. The longer answer: you\u2019ll be iterating upon it all throughout the creative process. It\u2019s true that you may not be able to have a good grasp on how to apply motion until you\u2019ve started loosely designing some flows and better start to identify opportunity areas, but in terms of coming up with a point of view on your brand\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s never too early. I\u2019ve found that the best way to begin is at the start of the creative process when you have all creative disciplines working together immersing themselves in the brand, philosophy, and goals. The easiest place to start is with any existing brand guidelines. How does a brand position itself now? What are its values? How do they want users to feel when they interact with their brand? And more importantly, is this brand looking to your team to help them evolve into something new? After we have a good grasp on this, we step back and get more inspiration from the brand\u2019s surrounding experiences. We start to think wide and look at tangents. Is there anything else that inspires you from things like: retail experiences, physical products, historical influence, their tone of voice, and larger philosophy? Start to capture the keywords that come to mind. One of my favorite examples: IBM\u2019s design language, \u201cMachines in Motion.\u201d The team developed micro-interactions by observing the movement of machines and how their motion related to their productive functions. Defining Motion\u00a0Pillars Now, as other creative disciplines begin to form their point of views on tone of voice, color, typography, imagery, and iconography, this is your chance to begin forming a point of view on behavior. Get inspired from the keywords your teammates might be using and the other brand inspiration you pulled. These keywords can be a little different from your overall brand guidelines, and they should be\u200a\u2014\u200amainly because they should be adjectives that are actionable (i.e. a brand\u2019s movement can\u2019t be described with something like \u201csustainable\u201d). The goal is to narrow down this list to about 3 unique keywords which will become your Motion Pillars. Which ones feel most authentic and ownable? These might change as you continue your creative process, but you at least have a solid start. While working on a project for UFC.TV at R/GA, our team began by immersing ourselves in the brand\u2019s guidelines and philosophy. Themes of discipline, athleticism, training, and respect were important to evoke. When speaking about the fighters and events, it was important for our copywriters to position events as epic in nature, develop compelling narratives by highlighting the fighters and their backgrounds, and to emphasize that fights are a culmination of years of training and dedication. We wanted our visual direction to feel precise and innovative; fighters should feel heroic and larger than life. In order to make the design feel dynamic, the team explored linear graphic elements to enhance select moments. The end result felt crisp, innovative, and immersive. All of these keywords and descriptions helped inform our 3 Motion Pillars: Strong, Swift, and Clean. Sample prototyping for a possible onboarding experience, informed by the Motion Pillars \u201cstrong, swift, and clean.\u201d Selections punch forward, the progress bar quickly advances, and the options swiftly transition from step to\u00a0step. Strong: Movement is inspired by athleticism. You can imagine some movement feeling like a quick jab or punch. Swift: Fighters are quick and precise. Imagine using a steep ease in and ease out curve to evoke this feeling in motion. Clean: UFC.TV is a premium service that we want to feel sophisticated. The benefits of having a point of view on your brand\u2019s\u00a0motion You\u2019ll find that starting with a point of view will help in 3 ways: communication, rationale, and cohesion. Motion Pillars help your your team have a shared dialogue and also help you better communicate the experience you\u2019re trying to create with your client (and they\u2019ll get way more excited because they start to better imagine the experience too). Once you start to get into the really specific design details and begin prototyping micro-interactions, they\u2019ll help you justify design decisions for what feels right. Lastly, it\u2019ll help every interaction feel more cohesive. Exercise! Try forming a point of view on what the Motion Pillars for the 3 brands below might be. If you don\u2019t want to work off of these, try picking 3 other miscellaneous brands. Some of these might be far more obvious and easier to come up with than others. The reality is, many of the brands we work with might be a lot harder to define Motion Pillars for. Don\u2019t give up and default to out-of-the-box interactions though! This is an important challenge for your team to attempt working though. Here\u2019s one iteration of Motion Pillars\u2026 see if yours aligns or is different! Ikea: clever, minimal, directional. FedEx: precise, efficient, gratifying. Patagonia: deliberate, mighty, wondrous. This is a great exercise to talk through with your team, clients, and ideally test on\u00a0users. Patagonia climbing gear. Photo by Mikey Schaefer. A few things that inspired me when doing this exercise: Ikea\u2019s retail experience (the easy flow around everything) and their minimalist, friendly assembly instructions. There\u2019s also something wonderful about making beauty and delight accessible to the masses. FedEx\u2019s goal of efficiency and precision. Their brand attributes consist of: simplifying, optimizing, inventive, connecting, certainty, personal. Patagonia\u2026. admittedly a little more vague. Personally, I\u2019m inspired by their philosophy and this whole sense of exploration and wonder. Their products are simplistic, designed for \u201csilent sports\u201d (i.e. none require a motor or have the cheer of a crowd) like climbing, skiing, surfing, and trail running. They\u2019re inspired by moments that connect us with nature. What else might you reference to help inform interaction? Applying Motion: Branded Moments & Branded\u00a0Behavior Alright, so now that you have a solid grasp on how you think your brand should move and behave, how do you begin applying it? At the start of your process, reflect on the product or service that you are about to design. I often begin by identifying some of the most important moments and flows that will inform the experience. Our team also tries to have a good grasp on what moments in the experience will set this service apart and be unique and ownable (e.g. Uber\u2019s home screen with cars driving around and \u201ctrips\u201d feature which was referenced earlier). These iconic pieces are what we call Branded Moments. Everything else in between should reflect a Branded Behavior. Both of these are inspired by your Motion Pillars. Branded Behaviors Let\u2019s start with Branded Behaviors. They essentially encompass any micro-interaction within the experience you are creating: the moments where you might be applying UX Choreography, such as providing feedback to users, hinting at what they can do or where they should go with Feedforward, allowing them to get familiar with where things from from and where they go next with Spatial Awareness, or highlighting the most important elements on screen to guide User Focus. These also include all the subtleties of any other transitions and states in between, such as hover states and transitions. The goal at the step is to begin to apply and refine your Motion Pillars to all micro-interactions in order to achieve cohesive treatment and give more specificity to guidelines. For each screen and flow you are designing, evaluate the goal, what you are trying to communicate to users, and what their primary need might be. One thing I find that helps is to start a running list of every type of micro-interaction we might encounter in our designs. This is a sample of what a running list of interactions might look like (taken from our work on UFC) and how you can start to group similar interactions into global and page specific elements. Start really wide when listing all of these moments, then narrow down. It helps if you start to group elements that should have similar treatment. For example, accordions or dialogues. It\u2019s helpful to work closely with Visual Designers at this point and time too (if you aren\u2019t already working towards that on your own)\u200a\u2014\u200aoften what you might have made in wireframes will look or operate a little differently once a visual designer has helped refine the vision. The two of you together can help articulate the exact motion executions you wish to see. A sampling of Airbnb\u2019s branded behavior. Each touchpoint feels immersive, seamless, exploratory, and friendly which makes the whole experience feels cohesive. Establishing Motion Guidelines around Branded\u00a0Behavior After you\u2019ve started to group categories of interactions, this is the point at which you can start to give more specific guidelines to your Motion Pillars, such as easing, velocity, opacity change or scale change. In the end, it\u2019s likely not realistic that you\u2019ll be able to prototype every little micro-interaction, but if you prototype a sampling it will be easy to see how the same treatment can be reused for other moments. Now that you\u2019ve refined your list of interactions, you may only need to prototype one sample from each category. In the moments that you do prototype, step back occasionally ask yourself whether the interaction is meeting your pillars (e.g. Does it feel Strong? Swift? Clean?) It helps to get someone else\u2019s eyes on your prototypes too for a gut check. The exact treatment you begin to apply will be the start of larger brand motion & interaction guidelines. These guidelines will also be the reference the development team can use whenever they might encounter other scenarios that need motion going forward. Future proofing for the win! One important caveat: When you look at this list of key moments you are establishing to apply motion, many of them will feel extremely subtle. They might seem lack-luster. Don\u2019t try to over-design and over-animate them to the point where they are over-the-top and illustrative. Motion should never get in the way and the best designs are still invisible. You\u2019ll find that as users begin to interact with your service more and more, the micro-interactions they will encounter will begin to compound. Over time, these subtle moments start to form an identity and your branded behavior starts to become evident. The same way you pick up on someone\u2019s mannerisms the more you get to know them over time, you start to pick up on a brand\u2019s behaviors. Misc. moments begin to feel like they have cohesive treatment once guidelines are established Branded Moments Whether it\u2019s at the start of your design process or something you begin to have a better grasp of as you go, you will start to identify moments in your experience that you realize are core to your overarching objective. It\u2019s a moment that you want to feel ownable and unique to your brand\u2019s identity. Or, you may be striving to create more surprise and delight in order to create something memorable. This is what we define as a Branded Moment. Each of these examples become a core part of the brand\u2019s identity. Nest\u2019s intuitive control dial of temperature, Starbucks\u2019 delightful cup of star rewards, and Snapchat\u2019s whimsical ghosts hidden around every\u00a0corner. These moments build off of your Motion Pillars, but are also opportunities to go above and beyond. Perhaps they are more illustrative, but it\u2019s for the purpose of establishing identity and experience. Work with your team and your client to evaluate what you think may be of utmost importance of where you think you can deliver the most impact. Again, ask yourself what may be relevant, authentic, and true for the brand and how you want your users to feel in this moment. Referencing the same 3 brands from earlier, what would you consider some opportunities to create Branded Moments? For FedEx, this might be the moment of tracking a shipment. For Ikea, online instructions for furniture assembly. And for Patagonia, it may be an element introduced in the shopping experience, such as the way you navigate products or see content with products in use. How would you rethink these moments to create something ownable? The UFC video page for live events and past events is where users would be spending the most of their time in the experience. Within these select modules in the body of the page, we wanted to give extra attention to things like the way live stats wiped clean between bouts, fighters transitioned, and how fans could predict winners. Wrapping up Designing for brand interaction should be an iterative process. Going forward, take the time to evaluate the experience you are creating and how you can best evoke your brand\u2019s tone. Reflect on how you want your users to feel and what you\u2019d want them to say about the experience. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to step back and edit\u200a\u2014\u200atoo many delightful details can start to get in the way. Admittedly, this process may not be so straightforward sometimes. You may be working on a largely established brand and only concentrating on a tiny stream of work. Don\u2019t let that hold you back, but rather gather all you know about what the brand has done to date in terms of establishing interaction guidelines and if you are able to subtly influence that point of view on your stream of work. Starting the conversation now will better help your team be successful in the long run. Looking ahead As mentioned earlier, motion is just one aspect of a larger story; screens may only be part of the equation. As UX designers, our roles are constantly evolving as we try to keep up with emerging trends and technology across digital experiences. Whether it may be bots, voice-enabled experiences, immersive interactions with VR, tiny watch interfaces, or physical environments enhanced by technology, we are best equipped to start connecting these dots and providing a holistic point of view on how to provide value to both brands and consumers. Designing for brands through interaction will help us create consistent, seamless, and familiar experience at any touchpoint, all while remaining authentic and distinct. Be sure to check out some of the great articles linked within here for more food for thought! Particularly the State of UX in 2017, which has some great thoughts on how the role of a UX designer is evolving.

In the end, it\u2019s likely not realistic that you\u2019ll be able to prototype every little micro-interaction, but if you prototype a sampling it will be easy to see how the same treatment can be reused for other moments. Now that you\u2019ve refined your list of interactions, you may only need to prototype one sample from each category. In the moments that you do prototype, step back occasionally ask yourself whether the interaction is meeting your pillars (e.g. Does it feel Strong? Swift? Clean?) It helps to get someone else\u2019s eyes on your prototypes too for a gut check. The exact treatment you begin to apply will be the start of larger brand motion & interaction guidelines. These guidelines will also be the reference the development team can use whenever they might encounter other scenarios that need motion going forward. Future proofing for the win!"}, {"ff73": "One important caveat: When you look at this list of key moments you are establishing to apply motion, many of them will feel extremely subtle. They might seem lack-luster. Don\u2019t try to over-design and over-animate them to the point where they are over-the-top and illustrative. Motion should never get in the way and the best designs are still invisible. You\u2019ll find that as users begin to interact with your service more and more, the micro-interactions they will encounter will begin to compound."}, {"9ea1": "Over time, these subtle moments start to form an identity and your branded behavior starts to become evident. The same way you pick up on someone\u2019s mannerisms the more you get to know them over time, you start to pick up on a brand\u2019s behaviors."}, {"90cd": "Misc. moments begin to feel like they have cohesive treatment once guidelines are established"}, {"a389": "Branded Moments"}, {"5854": "Whether it\u2019s at the start of your design process or something you begin to have a better grasp of as you go, you will start to identify moments in your experience that you realize are core to your overarching objective. It\u2019s a moment that you want to feel ownable and unique to your brand\u2019s identity. Or, you may be striving to create more surprise and delight in order to create something memorable. This is what we define as a Branded Moment."}, {"1e25": "Each of these examples become a core part of the brand\u2019s identity. Nest\u2019s intuitive control dial of temperature, Starbucks\u2019 delightful cup of star rewards, and Snapchat\u2019s whimsical ghosts hidden around every\u00a0corner."}, {"19aa": "These moments build off of your Motion Pillars, but are also opportunities to go above and beyond. Perhaps they are more illustrative, but it\u2019s for the purpose of establishing identity and experience. Work with your team and your client to evaluate what you think may be of utmost importance of where you think you can deliver the most impact. Again, ask yourself what may be relevant, authentic, and true for the brand and how you want your users to feel in this moment."}, {"3051": "Referencing the same 3 brands from earlier, what would you consider some opportunities to create Branded Moments? For FedEx, this might be the moment of tracking a shipment. For Ikea, online instructions for furniture assembly.

How would you rethink these moments to create something ownable?"}, {"3b2e": "The UFC video page for live events and past events is where users would be spending the most of their time in the experience. Within these select modules in the body of the page, we wanted to give extra attention to things like the way live stats wiped clean between bouts, fighters transitioned, and how fans could predict winners."}, {"a8dd": "Wrapping up"}, {"006b": "Designing for brand interaction should be an iterative process. Going forward, take the time to evaluate the experience you are creating and how you can best evoke your brand\u2019s tone. Reflect on how you want your users to feel and what you\u2019d want them to say about the experience. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to step back and edit\u200a\u2014\u200atoo many delightful details can start to get in the way."}, {"0c46": "Admittedly, this process may not be so straightforward sometimes. You may be working on a largely established brand and only concentrating on a tiny stream of work. Don\u2019t let that hold you back, but rather gather all you know about what the brand has done to date in terms of establishing interaction guidelines and if you are able to subtly influence that point of view on your stream of work. Starting the conversation now will better help your team be successful in the long run."}, {"5804": "Looking ahead"}, {"c0ad": "As mentioned earlier, motion is just one aspect of a larger story; screens may only be part of the equation. As UX designers, our roles are constantly evolving as we try to keep up with emerging trends and technology across digital experiences. Whether it may be bots, voice-enabled experiences, immersive interactions with VR, tiny watch interfaces, or physical environments enhanced by technology, we are best equipped to start connecting these dots and providing a holistic point of view on how to provide value to both brands and consumers. Designing for brands through interaction will help us create consistent, seamless, and familiar experience at any touchpoint, all while remaining authentic and distinct."}, {"246b": "Be sure to check out some of the great articles linked within here for more food for thought!
