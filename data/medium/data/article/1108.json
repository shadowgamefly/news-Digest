CREDIT: Wingspan, Liberty\u2019s student news\u00a0outlet For the past seven years, Frisco Independent School District, a booming and extremely diverse district outside of Dallas, has made a room available at Liberty High School for its Muslim students to pray. Before the prayer room existed, several students had been missing as much as two hours of class time on Fridays to travel to a mosque in Plano; by giving them a space to pray on school grounds, the district accommodated the students\u2019 religious needs and ensured equal access to education. But now then the Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found out about the room. And they\u2019re not happy about it. Last week, Deputy Attorney General Andrew Leonie sent the school a letter\u200a\u2014\u200aand issued an accompanying press release\u200a\u2014\u200aexpressing \u201cconcerns\u201d that it was discriminating against non-Muslim students by providing an accommodation exclusively for the Muslim students. \u201cIt is unclear whether students of other faiths may use the room at the same time or at other times during the week,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt appears that students are being treated different based on their religious beliefs.\u201d Monday morning, Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) took to Fox News to defend the office\u2019s actions, but even the Fox & Friends crew was skeptical. \u201cYou don\u2019t really have any evidence that people were being excluded, did you?\u201d Steve Doocy asked. \u201cNo, actually, we weren\u2019t sure,\u201d Paxton responded. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we sent the letter.\u201d Twice in that interview, Paxton said he hadn\u2019t heard anything back from the district, suggesting he hadn\u2019t read the news at all over the weekend. Frisco\u2019s superintendent, Dr. Jeremy Lyon, actually responded on Friday in a very terse letter calling out the OAG for a \u201cpublicity stunt.\u201d Indeed, it seems the OAG\u2019s only trigger for responding was some recent uncontroversial media coverage that the prayer room had received. Lyon pointed out that the OAG claimed it was responding to an \u201cinitial inquiry\u201d but that there was zero evidence the office had ever reached out to the district over its apparent \u201cconcerns.\u201d Instead, it issued its letter\u200a\u2014\u200aand press release\u200a\u2014\u200abased not on any evidence, but apparently because the media coverage spurred constituents to be concerned. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tweeted on Friday that \u201cmany of you have questioned\u201d the prayer room \u201cissue.\u201d Lyon demanded documentation to verify whether OAG had actually reached out to the district as part of its inquiry, and also whether it had any evidence of individuals being denied access to the prayer room The basis of Leonie\u2019s letter was a report earlier this month by Frisco\u2019s own video journalism students that described the prayer room as being \u201cdedicated to the religious needs of some students.\u201d This is clearly a reference to the fact that only \u201csome\u201d students have \u201creligious needs\u201d for such an accommodation. But Leonie\u2019s letter cites this specific phrasing as evidence that the prayer room is somehow off-limits to other students. In his response, Lyon cited a recent public radio report that also covered Frisco\u2019s prayer room and the budding diversity at Liberty High School. In it, Principal Scott Warstler specifically says of the Muslim students, \u201cThey take care of themselves in their group and they accept those that are a part of their group. And honestly, if others wanted to go in and learn and see and experience that, they\u2019re OK with that.\u201d The story also featured students of other religious faiths talking about how their faiths have been accommodated in various ways. Likely referencing the Trump administration\u2019s multiple Muslim bans and constant fear-mongering that Islam is a threat to the United States, Lyon called out the OAG for further fomenting such intolerance. \u201cIt is important to note Frisco ISD is greatly concerned that this type of inflammatory rhetoric in the current climate may place the District, its students, staff, parents, and community in danger of unnecessary disruption,\u201d the superintendent wrote. In addition to requesting all documentation of inquiries and complaints, Lyon also suggested that \u201cideally,\u201d the OAG will issue a follow-up press release \u201cto clear up any confusion\u201d from its first press release.
