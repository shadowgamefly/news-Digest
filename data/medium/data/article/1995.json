For the last years I have continued to build and design applications web and mobile, and i have learn how to deal with different departments and utilise their knowledge in order to make better products and build better design systems that scaled better and more efficient. There are obviously a whole lot more elements you can establish to create a core foundation for your design identity. I will share some of my insights on design systems that scaled and keep all the language consistent across departments and platforms. Design language or design systems is more then just ui styles guides is also the way the team works and what are the team values & principles. \u2026\u2026. The system \u201cBuilding products that people love is part of the good design foundations a good design system by creating great experiences for our customer, everyone needs to contribute to creating high-quality products that inspire customers, but to achieve all of this we need to have a strong foundations within the teams across the business, everything is a little piece to the puzzle.\u201d From typography, layouts and grids, colours, icons, components and coding conventions, to voice and tone, style-guide, documentation, a design system is bringing all of these together in a way that allows your entire team to learn, build, and grow\u2026 The future Design systems will give us the flexibility we need for working with the unknown devices of the future. It may be a change in process, but it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a difference in thinking. We need to keep experimenting and communicating, particularly in the area of design, as good user experiences are the true sign of whether our products are a success. When i build design systems i not only look on the library, but in how we work today, tool, design process, documentation, the whole ecosystem, otherwise you just cleaning the dusk and place it under. Isn\u2019t enough to focus only on visual, we need to align first the foundations, such as documentation, tools we use everyday, our design process, all of this is very important to build a strong design foundation, as well on how to organise your files, how to name them, which tools everyone is using, do an inventory of all of this points and start to clean them up and align everything. Before starting any work toward your design system, talk to all the major stakeholders who might need to reference or update the system. Ensure you understand what works well today, what challenges could be solved through the system, and how each stakeholder likes to work. Getting everyone on board at the beginning, and collaborating with them throughout the process is essencial for the success of the language you are designing. The design team or a \u201cDLS team\u201d might \u201cown\u201d the design system, it\u2019s creation should be a team effort with a collective desire provide both a fantastic user experience while adding efficiency to internal processes through effective documentation and reusable components. Remember; Building a design system is a long process filled with trial and error, Test, learn, Fail\u2026. Set the foundations right before to move to visual side, this is very important as it will speed up the process on later stage. First i check:\u00a01\u200a\u2014\u200atools we currently using,\u00a02 \u2014Naming we using on folders, files, layers, even the name system for the symbols in sketch and styles.\u00a03\u200a\u2014\u200aDocumentation i write down everything all the rules, etc.. so this will be really helpful when you have any doubts just go to the file and double check,\u00a04\u200a\u2014\u200aStyle guide. You need to setup your workstation before diving into design, let\u2019s say you are a bartender, before the service you need to setup the bottles, coffee machine, ingredients ready for the cocktails etc.. so this way when you open the bar all is ready and well setup, here it works the same way. Files names, documentation, tools Tools Doesn\u2019t matter which tools you use, but is very important to standardized those into the process. Tools i use to build Style guide\u00a0lines When i say tools i mean, everything you use on your design process, from Notes, collaboration to design. Check the with the team and define the tools you going to use. Folders &\u00a0Naming Is annoying to spend half hour to look for some file, or the most recent version, Organise correctly your folders with names and syntaxes everyone knows. My folder\u00a0system Here is a screen shot of my default folder system, copy paste the \u201cfolder system\u201d and rename it to the currently project im working on. Within one folder i place all the documents for UX and visual designs, so if you looking for wireframes is in 02_ux folder, if looking for the most recent designs is on 01_design. Inside of the assets i place the others resources i might\u00a0need File naming conventions Wait, I\u2019m confused. Should I use \u201cNEWEST.sketch\u201d or \u201cLATEST.sketch\u201d? How about \u201cFinal_v2.sketch\u201d? Make sure everyone knows how what to use clearly, without a defined naming convention, files often become named \u2018homepage\u2019, \u2018homepage v1\u2019, \u2018homepage_v2\u2019 and so on. Example:name_version_date.sketchComponentName_YourName_Date.sketch Pick an order. Use hyphens or underscores but not both. Never spaces.\u00a0I don\u2019t have the formula to format perfect naming, you need to try and stick to the formula. Choose a Convention and Stick to It Documentation Literally documenting the design system was the biggest challenge for me. Designs should include explanations or examples of functionality. There are many ways to provide elements with specifications that serve as documentation. Give them a general idea of what it should look like along with functionality in the same place. I started to document everything till now, from folders name, file name, design process, which tools to use while designing and collaborative. For now, i use Google Docs It\u2019s easily accessible by all team, plus they can comment inline, which is great for feedback. Design Board UI Inventory Audit A UI inventory, or audit, will help you easily identify problems and uncover information you may not know existed. I recently i found over eight variations of one button, each button just a little off from the other. The point is, nobody really knew how many problems there really were until we did the UI inventory. These kinds of problems cause visual disharmony, unneeded markup, and bloated CSS sheets. \u201cThe other two buttons had slightly different font sizes and styles.\u201d Maybe you could start with an interface inventory and a simple list of the components you\u2019ve found. Focus on the parts that will be used repeatedly or that at least have the potential to be used again.

Unlike Sketch symbols, elements within Craft library are not bound to the elements within a single Sketch file. This allowed to create a shared library of assets (hosted on Dropbox or other cloud) that the team can use to drag and drop elements into their designs. If the library is updated, it auto-updates for all team members! Having a preset library of buttons, inputs, styles, etc. reduces the risk of elements being repeatedly redesigned and saves time. my example of share\u00a0library Craft by InVision LABSDownload Craft, a free suite of tools for Sketch and Photoshop that let you design with real data in mind.labs.invisionapp.com Create a document and explain how to use them, and where to get it, so when you had new designers you just give them the toolbox and they are ready to go.

Naming layers: Be as descriptive as possible on *every* layer. \u201cLayer 0 copy copy\u201d isn\u2019t gonna cut it.

I like to use 8pt grid system, The 8pt grid system. Use increments of 8 to size and space out the elements on a page. To me this means that any defined height or width, margin or padding will be an increment of 8. What are\u00a0points? A point (pt) is a measurement of space that is dependent on screen resolution. The simplest explanation is that at a \u201c1x\u201d resolution (or @1x), 1pt = 1px.At a \u201c2x\u201d resolution (@2x), 1pt = 4px because resolution doubles on both the X and Y axes making it 2px wide by 2px tall.At a \u201c3x\u201d resolution (@3x), 1pt = 9px (3px x 3px) and so on.

Now you might be wondering at what sizes to use. Well, a modular scale is the best way to determine your typographic sizes and even the proportions of your whole layout. You first choose a ratio, then you pick the base size of your text, for example, 16px. After that, you multiply to get the sequential numbers: 16px, 26px, 42px, 68px, 110px. Diatonic Type ScaleRepsonsive Type Scale - Based off of traditional print type sizesty-p.cc Modular ScaleUse a scale like you would use a ruler. Many people set heading type sizes with numbers from a scale, but that's just\u2026www.modularscale.com Typography & Text\u00a0Styles Use different type sizes and weights to convey a visual and rhythm. I like to give myself the widest range possible of text sizes and styles, so my typography sheet looks like this, i do also create a dark version of it. Design is dynamic and adaptability is key. Functions, features, and aesthetics are often likely to change. Defining text formatting as first stage it will help you on the way. Using slashes in your text style names (see above) will create little sub menus in your styles dropdown: \u201cA modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate to one another in a meaningful way. Using the golden ratio, for example, we can produce values for a modular scale by multiplying by 1.618 to arrive at the next highest number, or dividing by 1.618 to arrive at the next number down.\u201d More Meaningful TypographyDesigning with modular scales is one way to make more conscious, meaningful choices about measurement on the web\u2026alistapart.com Explorations The important aspects of design for both parties is to understand the goals of the product you are designing. We tend to jump straight into pixels and quickly flesh out the UI of the project. If it\u2019s a brand new website, or a new feature, be sure to set clear goals of what you want to achieve. I collect all images to my Inspiration folder. I use mood boards mainly to discuss my thoughts with colleagues and describe some of the visual ideas, before I start with the pixel process, collect much information as possible. Colours / typography exploration First Draft Designing is always an ongoing process. You\u2019re going to iterate a lot along your way to a great result. With first draft is also comes gathering of first feedback. You don\u2019t have to come to pixel perfect design in order to start receiving feedback from your teammates, clients or potential users. I normally work with 2 drafts versions along side, so i mix colours buttons typography styles etc, to build the foundations. With this draft i have an idea of which direction i want to go, colours and general style. I\u2019ve always struggled with designing nice headers while I the rest of the canvas was white. While designing I learned to put all the content in place first\u200a\u2014\u200ajust play with the layout and typography. It\u2019s much easier to design nice details and play with the whole concept with the content in place. Now is all done, i know which colours and typography i have the base foundation for a style guide, At this stage i don\u2019t organise anything i do that after when i know which foundations i will processed. Building a pattern\u00a0library The concept of a pattern library is simple: Break down an interface into reusable building blocks, arrange and group them, name them, establish rules between them, generate an overview of all components, and make them available for the entire team to build and design with. After the exploration, reviews and iterations, you arrive at the style you are happy with, you have define the global style palette.\u00a0The task now is to create the suite of patterns and components, accounting for all states and scenarios\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially creating a comprehensive UI kit. The visual system is made up of foundational elements like defined text styles for headers and content, a colour palette, inputs, forms, what we call patterns and components. This includes navigation, cards, tables, empty or loading states, notifications, alerts and modals. Patterns are versatile, can contain components, and be paired together to make up a template. A pattern library is closely tied with the code base because it is often generated from the code base itself with tools for living style guides. Style guide Approaches to make pattern library\u00a0usable \u2026How do we make a pattern library more likely to be used throughout an organization, then? Perhaps by shifting the focus away from the modular methodology and towards a more general big-picture view of components. Here is a few interesting approaches to this issue. - Atomic Design\u00a0Theory Atomic Design is a popular set of principles based on a way of thinking about design systems on the web. It helps web folks think about elements users interact with and how they fit together into a holistic system. It\u2019s based on foundations of web concepts which can apply in the design phase. Coined by Brad Frost, his guide is available online. Here is a great article where explains what is the Atomic design: \u201cAtomic Design using Sketch is the future of product design.\u201d The unicorn workflow: design to code with Atomic Design principles and Sketch - InVision BlogAtomic Design using Sketch is the future of product design\u00a0. Brad Frost, the stunning human being in the video above\u2026blog.invisionapp.com General Electric\u2019s Predix design\u00a0system Is another great example principles and applications. \u201c In PracticeThe internal launch of the Predix Design System included design patterns created and documented by the Predix platform design team, as well as patterns contributed by teams building products on top of Predix. Launching with contributions from multiple teams allowed us to fill the entire hierarchy of the design system with content. The Platform team, as the stewards of the design system, provided most of the foundational design patterns for Principles, Basics, Components, and Templates.
