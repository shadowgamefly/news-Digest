I\u2019ve said it many times: reading books is a major key to success. The mega-rich and successful like Bill Gates and Elon Musk devote extraordinary amounts of their time to reading. Musk even attributes his knowledge of how to build rockets to his reading repertoire, and studies have proven that reading can reduce stress, increase focus, and improve long- and short-term memory. The benefits of flexing your reading muscles are clear. But reading is time-consuming\u200a\u2014\u200aand as a busy professional, it\u2019s almost impossible to both find the time to read and actually stay focused enough to reap the benefits when deadlines start piling up. Thankfully, experts at Harvard Business Review (along with a few others) have discovered some tips and tricks to ensure that you not only make reading a daily habit, but that you\u2018re able to radically increase the amount you read and the benefits you reap. Read on for seven practical ways to continue to improve your reading habits as time goes on: 1. Accept that it\u2019s okay to\u00a0quit. Sometimes I\u2019ll start a book, only to find that I\u2019m not really enjoying it or finding much meaning in it\u200a\u2014\u200abut I\u2019ll \u201cpower through\u201d anyway, because I don\u2019t want to be a quitter. Gretchen Rubin, author of bestselling book The Happiness Project and habit expert at Harvard Business Review, found that this \u201cwinners don\u2019t quit\u201d mentality probably won\u2019t work for your reading habit. As Rubin put it, quitting early gives you \u201cMore time for reading good books! Less time reading books out of a sense of obligation.\u201d Think of it this way\u200a\u2014\u200aabout 50,000 books are published every year. Why spend time with books you don\u2019t really enjoy? If you ultimately don\u2019t enjoy a novel, free yourself from guilt and put it down. 2. There are hidden minutes everywhere. Stephen King, who attributes reading to much of his incredible success as an author, reportedly told people to read about 5 hours a day if they want to follow in his footsteps. As a time-strapped entrepreneur, I first laughed at that notion. That is until HBR pointed out how often King actually reads on the go, or outside of his house. Take all the times he\u2019s been spotted reading at Red Sox games, for instance. To the average passerby, it might seem insane to whip out a book at Fenway Park. But if they knew that very same habit helped King sell over 350 million books, they might be inclined to bring a paperback next time. As Parisha put it, \u201cThere are minutes hidden in all the corners of the day, and they add up to a lot of minutes.\u201d I\u2019m not saying you should whip out a novel at your sister\u2019s wedding ceremony, but there are small opportunities to read nearly everywhere. 3. Keep it\u00a0quiet. Science shows that sharing your intentions with others when you\u2019re working toward a task or goal can backfire, and make you less likely to succeed. A 2009 study found that when students who wanted to become psychologists wrote down activities that would help them achieve that goal and shared them with the experimenter, they were less likely to actually perform those activities. The control group who did not share their list of intended activities with the experimenter spent much more time pursuing those activities. When people share their goal, they feel less motivation to work hard. So if you\u2019re committing to reading more books, express your goal and your steps to get there\u200a\u2014\u200aeven write it down\u200a\u2014\u200abut keep it to yourself. 4. Limit distractions. Neil Pasricha made this happen in his home by banishing the TV to the basement, and placing the bookshelf front and center. According to HBR, Pasricha drew inspiration from the famous \u201cchocolate chip cookie and radish\u201d experiment by psychologist Roy Baumeister. Hungry test subjects were asked to complete a lengthy puzzle, and some were given no food, while others were given cookies (and told not to eat them). Unsurprisingly, the cookie group caved the soonest\u200a\u2014\u200athey were the group that had spent all their willpower staying away from the cookies. 5. Read physical\u00a0books. The same advice about limiting distractions can be applied in a big way to favoring physical books over e-readers. Having a tangible piece of reading material in your hand\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of an internet-connected device where you can also check your email or look up recipes on Pinterest\u200a\u2014\u200acan limit distraction and necessary willpower. But limiting distractions is just one of the reasons to favor physical books over e-novels. In an era where all our entertainment and professional channels are moving to the screen, it\u2019s a good brain refresh to hold a physical book in your hand. 6. Change your\u00a0mindset. Media strategist and author Ryan Holiday stresses that changing how you think about reading is the key to reading more. \u201cYou need to stop thinking of it as \u2018some activity that you do\u2026 [it] must become as natural as eating and breathing to you. It\u2019s not something you do because you feel like it, but because it\u2019s a reflex, a default,\u201d he says. To the successful, a dream isn\u2019t achieved by deliberating how to reach it, but rather it\u2019s a specific, well-conceived desire that always happens. You can do this today by turning your reading habits into specific, time-sensitive goals, and placing them on the top of your priority list every day. 7. Find curated\u00a0lists. Decision fatigue is a very real thing, and it can eat away at your willpower when trying to adopt new habits like reading. The overwhelming effort to sift through thousands of new books each year can eat away at your mental power before you actually read a page - and that\u2019s why HBR recommends you find curated book lists. Luckily mega-moguls like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg aren\u2019t shy about sharing their reading lists. With a few minutes of Google sleuthing, you can follow in the reading habits of the greats. Maybe we can\u2019t all read 500 pages a day like Warren Buffet, or finish 50 books a year like Bill Gates. But you can commit to using these tips to read more books this year, improve your ability to absorb information, and benefit from scientific advantages that reading can bring.
