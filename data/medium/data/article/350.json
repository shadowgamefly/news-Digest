{"name": "350", "parent": "", "content": "What I Told My Daughter When She Asked Why I Lost My Job: on Cheating, Mental Illness, and How Much to Tell the\u00a0Kids \u201cDid you lose your job for the same reason Mom divorced you?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0It is Sunday afternoon, we are in the car, coming back from a birthday party. As so often with my first born, Heloise has wrestled with a question for days before asking it. In recent months, she has been assembling in her mind the story of her parents\u2019 breakup. She\u2019s also been piecing together a timeline for how the world of her early childhood\u200a\u2014\u200aa world of nannies, new cars, a huge house with a yard \u2013became a world of a small apartment with bars on the windows.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago, she asked why we\u2019d left that first big house. \u201cDaddy lost his job, bunny.\u201d She nodded. Based on experience, I knew the follow-ups were coming soon. My ex and I agreed long ago never to lie to the kids, and to give them honest answers when they ask. With each passing month, the task gets more challenging. As almost everyone reading this probably knows, I lost my college teaching job after confessing to sleeping with my students. I lost my marriage for essentially the same reason; my ex left me after finding about my many affairs. My daughter found out about my affairs last year, when kids in her school (ours is a close-knit community) told her the truth. When Heloise came home confused, her mother and I explained, separately, what \u201ccheating\u201d was and how it could end a marriage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heloise was seven when we told her this. I wasn\u2019t ready. Judging by the equanimity with which she received the news, she was. So when she asks this question on Sunday, there\u2019s no need to stall. I smile slightly at her in the rear-view mirror. \u201cYes, baby. I lost my job for more or less the same reason your mom and I got divorced.\u201d \u201cSo you were a teacher, and you cheated, and they made you leave your job?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d I hesitate. I know exactly what the follow-up is that\u2019s coming. \u201cWhy would they care? Was cheating against the rules for teachers?\u201d Heloise is always willing to ask harder questions when her little brother isn\u2019t around. David has a playdate, and we\u2019ll pick him up later. I breathe very calmly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that I was cheating. I was cheating with students in my classes. These students were grown-ups, but it was still against the rules.\u201d \u201cHow old were they?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Tempting to lie. Best not to. \u201cThey were in their teens and twenties.\u201d Heloise is silent for a moment. One last question for the car ride. \u201cDid you cheat because you were sick?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Heloise has seen me hospitalized more than once. She knows I take medication, and knows the word \u201cbipolar.\u201d Every summer at the beach or pool, when my shirt comes off, she sees the scars from all my self-injuring behavior. And my God, how tempting it is to blame everything on my mental illness! I\u2019d love to be able to say, \u201cYes, sweetheart, abba cheated and did those bad things because he was sick. It wasn\u2019t his fault!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I won\u2019t lie to her. I am bipolar af, as they say these days, with a personality disorder to go with it, but I wasn\u2019t manic when I went back to sleeping with my students. The truth is, time and again, calm and sober and clear-headed, I chose the rush of a new connection over my obligations and my promises. I chose and chose and chose and chose. The disease explains a lot about why I reacted so destructively when caught; it does not explain why I screwed up in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I may be the most indiscreet father south of the Tehachapis, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll be the most dishonest one. \u201cNo, baby, I didn\u2019t cheat because I was sick. I\u2019m afraid I just made some serious mistakes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I almost say \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d but I don\u2019t want her to come back with her reflexive \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d The hardest part of being a mentally ill parent is making sure that you never put your kids in the position to have to soothe you. On my fragile days, that\u2019s tougher than it should be. Heloise looks out the window. I get a flash of her as a teen in therapy, calling me up on the phone to tell me she hates my guts. I get a flash of her as a teen a year later, hugging me and telling me she doesn\u2019t hate me anymore. I know the arc of adolescent reckoning with parental narratives better than many; I spent decades teaching students how to write their way through the process.\u00a0\u00a0I think of something Danielle, my therapist, always says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you did before. All your kids will care about in the end is that you fought for them and did everything you could to stay in their lives.\u201d I know she\u2019s right, but I wonder quite what she means by \u201cthe end.\u201d When Heloise and David are grown? When I\u2019m dead?\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Heloise says as I pull up outside the apartment. \u201cDo we have mac and cheese? The orange kind, not the white?\u201d \u201cWe do,\u201d I say. \u201cCome help me make it.\u201d We bolt from the car. In the Kabbalah Centre, where my kids are being raised, they teach that children pick their parents. Before it\u2019s born, a preborn soul selects the exact environment it will need in order to experience the spiritual growth it needs. This is, of course, immensely comforting to parents; how can you truly fail your kids when their little souls already \u201cknew\u201d everything you\u2019d do? I don\u2019t believe in a lot of woo, and I don\u2019t believe in this, but it\u2019s the most tempting tenet of the faith that I know. I\u2019ve already longed to throw a \u201cHey, you chose me!\u201d at the kids when they\u2019re upset. I would never dare, but still.\u00a0\u00a0Heloise and David probably didn\u2019t choose me, but here they are with me regardless. Here they are with this man as loving as he is embarrassing, as flawed as he is devoted, as incapable of being quiet as he is of quitting caffeine. So no, I didn\u2019t want my daughter to find out this early that her father lost his job and threw away his marriage to their mother because he was unfaithful. But the lies that would have been required to prevent her from finding out would have done far more damage in the long run. I\u2019m gambling that if I\u2019m willing to tell her hard truths about my private life now, she\u2019ll be willing to do the same when she\u2019s older and going through a difficult time. Candor is an investment.\u00a0\u00a0We make the mac and cheese together, and eat it. I make it her way, with the cheese powder only partly stirred in, so it clumps together into savory golden nuggets. \u201cDo you have any more questions?\u201d I ask as we eat.\u00a0\u00a0Heloise nods. \u201cCan I have three Oreos instead of two after dinner?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI suppose. Is that your only question?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0My daughter shrugs happily. \u201cFor now, abba.
