Take Steph Curry, for example. The two-time defending MVP spent the year rebounding from an embarrassing Finals collapse, adjusting to the arrival of a 6-foot-9 Reaper in his offense, and putting up one of the worst shooting nights ever by the very stroke that famed him (and a low-pressure system that threw off his shot). This time last year, he was being coronated as one of the game\u2019s all-time greats. Now, he finds himself removed from the MVP conversation, left out as we debate the merits of a seemingly exclusive club of four\u200a\u2014\u200aJames Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James. Where You Stand in the Westbrook-Harden MVP Debate Says a Lot About YouHow do you define \u201cmost valuable\u201d?theringer.com Thankfully, Curry did not get the message about our fixed story lines. And as Exhibits A through K, he\u2019d like to present this little 11-game winning streak on which he\u2019s led the Warriors. In his past three games alone, Steph racked up wins against the Spurs, Rockets, and Wizards, averaging nearly 32 points and eight assists, during which he outplayed niche MVP front-runner Leonard, actual MVP front-runner Harden, and near-future MVP contender John Wall. Against San Antonio last Wednesday, Curry bought a fixer-upper bed-and-breakfast behind the arc, refurbishing the spot long enough to sink three 3s in the third set. His 13 points that quarter helped Golden State reclaim the lead and assert its Western Conference supremacy. He finished with 29 points and 11 assists in Golden State\u2019s ninth consecutive win. Against the Rockets two days later, Curry filled up his highlight reel with dimes of every kind, showing off that endearing way his playmaking sometimes looks like the love child of luck and skill. Twenty-four points, five assists, seven rebounds, and two steals later, Curry led the team to its 10th straight. On Sunday, in a 139\u2013115 Warriors win over Washington, this pregame shot at Oracle was a sign of things to come. An early 3-pointer was Curry\u2019s most impressive, as he simultaneously faked Marcin Gortat out of knowing Polish altogether and whispered, \u201cKomu pora, temu czas\u201d (\u201cWhen it\u2019s your time, you have to go\u201d), as the shot went down. RIP, Gortat, though it had to be you, as we all know you hate wearing black. After draining six from behind the arc in the first half for 22 points, Curry sunk a deep ball in the third quarter to pass 300 beyond-the-arc makes on the season, a league high. The guy trailing almost 50 3-pointers behind in second place is teammate Klay Thompson, which, ah, right: Splash Brothers. Welcome back. The team\u2019s performance has had the same effervescence as last year\u2019s regular-season Warriors, and Curry has played at his old MVP level. After losing five of seven in late February and early March and struggling to find his groove as the team shifted from no Durant to Durant (then back to no Durant), Curry\u2019s concerns were bigger than his erasure from this year\u2019s MVP running. Having Kevin Durant and Curry both in Oakland is obviously better than not, but Curry\u2019s newfound success during KD\u2019s absence does call attention to the Durantula in the room. Does having a KD-less court to preside over free up Steph? The thought has entered Steve Kerr\u2019s mind. Jokes aside, Curry ended Sunday\u2019s game with 42 points and eight assists on 68 percent shooting (64 percent from deep). Steph is rewriting the story of his season at the perfect time.
