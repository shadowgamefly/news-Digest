{"name": "1670", "parent": "", "content": "Who says engineers can\u2019t become entrepreneurs? A lot of people warned me not to walk away from my great position at Andreessen Horowitz to pursue software engineering. \u2026And now that I\u2019m leaving my dream job engineering at Coinbase to co-found a startup, you can bet that \u201ca lot of people\u201d have been reminding me how many startups fail. It was my Mom\u2019s reaction, though, that stuck with me: \u201cWhy would you leave the best job in the world\u2026\u00a0again?\u201d It\u2019s a good question\u200a\u2014\u200aand I\u2019m writing this post to answer it. As those of you who\u2019ve been following along know, the past year and half has been a wild one for me, from falling passionately in love with programming, to leaving an amazing job to pursue this passion, to enduring Hack Reactor\u2019s intensive coding program, to tackling complex problems as an engineer at a major cryptocurrency startup. Long story short, it was an exhilarating journey with countless late nights, early mornings, and moments of self-doubt. Today, I\u2019ll pick up where I left off, sharing some of my ups and downs as an engineer at Coinbase\u2026 and reveal some of the exciting projects I\u2019m diving into now! My experience as a full-time software\u00a0engineer It was April of 2016 when Coinbase offered me a software engineering role on their Brokerage team. The team was brilliant, the industry was cutting edge. Needless to say, I accepted immediately!\u00a0\u00a0The days before I started were nerve-wracking. (If you\u2019ve ever waited to start a new job before, you know how fear and anxiety can make you second-guess everything.) I haven\u2019t been so nervous to walk into a building since the first day of middle school. \ud83d\ude33 My internal monologue as I rode the elevator up their towering office building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District went something like this: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a full-time software engineer at a company before. Do I even know what I\u2019m doing? What if I get asked to build a micro-service within 48 hours? Or to rebuild the entire website within a week? I\u2019m surely doomed\u2026\u201d\u00a0I stepped out of the elevator, took a deep breath\u200a\u2014\u200aand stood there frozen for two minutes, trying to build up enough courage to ring the buzzer. \u201cBuzzzzz\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, my nervousness was misplaced. The receptionist was warm and kind. The recruiting coordinator was more worried about how I liked my workspace than what I would be doing at it. I\u2019d barely put down my backpack before the CEO, Brian Armstrong, came by to say \u201cWelcome! Glad to have you on board!\u201d\u00a0\u201cPhew, no micro-services just yet,\u201d I thought.\u00a0By then, my nervousness turned into excitement\u200a\u2014\u200aI couldn\u2019t wait to get hacking. Perhaps I\u2019m not ready to build a micro-service on my first day, but I sure was ready to build something!\u00a0\u00a0The next few weeks were a steady build of responsibility and familiarity\u200a\u2014\u200agetting comfortable with the code bases, merging my first few pull requests, and integrating with the workflow, team, and culture. The challenge of diving into a completely new code base, gaining momentum in fixing bugs and implementing features, and building relationships with new friends kept me engaged and excited.\u00a0Fast-forward a couple months later, and I was firmly settled in. By then, I had two major projects under my belt\u200a\u2014\u200aone where I A/B tested and implemented a new fee structure, and another where I built a new React/Redux front-end for supporting Ethereum buys and sells. I was ready to start on my third and largest project, which was to rewrite the existing monolith Rails front-end in React. Four months later, we shipped v1 of that massive rewrite. Phew!\u00a0\u00a0By then it had already been six months and there were lots of things that I was really enjoying about working at Coinbase: Team My gut instinct about the team was right. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a smarter bunch of engineers to work with everyday. From infrastructure, data science, fraud, payments, web and mobile, I had infinite opportunity to learn and grow from engineers across different engineering domains. Beyond their strong technically chops, I admired that they were also well-rounded. (Not to mention mature thoughtful and independent thinkers.) Ownership I loved that Coinbase gives engineers a high degree of autonomy and ownership over the implementation details of the features they build, rather than a top-down regimented system. Being invested in my projects and tackling problems independently helped me learn and grow more quickly as an engineer. Growth mindset Another thing that I appreciated was that the company deeply cares about continuous feedback and learning. Nothing we did was ever perfect\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, disorder was the norm. Regardless, the team would make sure to have retrospectives after every project to discuss what did and didn\u2019t go well. \u2026And let me tell you, we didn\u2019t hold back. We criticized and laughed at ourselves, and then thought carefully about how we could avoid those mistakes the next time around. Personal and team progress is hard but important work. Oh, so many\u00a0perks I don\u2019t really have to explain this one\u200a\u2014\u200awho can resist the fully stocked kitchen, lovely office staff, pleasantly decorated bathrooms, and catered meals\u200a\u2014\u200aall with a 360-degree view of beautiful San Francisco? The downsides As with everything, every pro comes with cons. Here are a few things that I personally didn\u2019t like about plugging into the corporate engineering structure: Working in\u00a0Rails While half of my time was spent in the new JavaScript and React front-end, the other half inevitably involved fixing bugs and implementing features in our monolithic Rails application. Rails is a phenomenal framework for many reasons, but personally, I was struggling to fall in love with it. It eventually became the least favorite part of my job.\u00a0\u00a0As regular readers know, the JavaScript community and ecosystem is a huge passion area for me. So naturally, I wanted to contribute my time and energy to mastering JavaScript, functional programming, and the web. Instead, I was fixing uninteresting bugs and implementing unsexy features in what felt like the wrong framework. Unfortunately, the reality is that maintaining old monolithic software is a core part of what we, as software engineers, must do when we\u2019re working in a large engineering organization. Those are just the facts of life! Open office work\u00a0space Open offices are wildly popular in the tech world\u200a\u2014\u200ain spite of the the many studies showing how they can kill creativity and make focus impossible. The constant human traffic and frequent interruptions made it feel like I was coding on live television. I found it difficult to be productive and eventually found myself working from home more and more frequently\u200a\u2014\u200ait was the only place I could focus and get deep work done. The product and projects I wasn\u2019t passionate about Alright, enough complaining Preethi! Time to get honest about why I felt restless\u200a\u2014\u200athe truth is, my unhappiness had nothing to do with Coinbase as an organization.\u00a0At the end of the day, it was because I wasn\u2019t passionate about the product Coinbase offers. First, it wasn\u2019t something that fired me up to get out of bed in the morning. It was difficult to care deeply about the features we were building, when financial products and services wasn\u2019t a passion area for me personally.\u00a0Second, I realized that being at a company with separate roles for product management, project management, engineering management, design, and engineering inevitably meant that the role I served was purely engineering\u200a\u2014\u200ato implement and engineer solutions and fix bugs. Those of you who know me can probably imagine how neglecting the entrepreneurial part of my mind would leave me unsatisfied. I wanted to do everything from identifying the business purpose, to building the product, to maintaining and advancing the codebase. I needed to be both the entrepreneur and the programmer. Doubting the corporate engineering trajectory At this point, I knew that the career trajectory I was on needed to change course. Maybe not as drastically as leaving finance for engineering\u200a\u2014\u200abut something that engaged me as both an engineer and an entrepreneur needed to happen. Soon.\u00a0\u00a0Nights and weekends became my \u201centrepreneur-programmer\u201d time, and I meticulously planned my schedule so I\u2019d have 1\u20132 hours every day to explore, learn, hack, write, and have fun. Soon, that 1\u20132 hours grew into 2\u20134 hours a day. At a certain point, side projects like writing and hacking on app ideas began to seem more \u201creal\u201d than my 9\u20135.\u00a0\u00a0Did I feel guilty for wanting to leave a perfect team to work on another crazy dream? Of course. Rather than make a spur of the moment decision, I decided to take some time off to reflect on what I was feeling. It\u2019s tricky to figure out what truly makes you tick. But I needed to figure it out so I could answer the burning question: where can I contribute to this world in the most meaningful way? I treated this time like a \u201ctest drive\u201d to see what it\u2019s like to wake up every morning and do whatever my heart and mind desired. Was this just a phase, or could I turn my ideas into a full-time reality?\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks turned into a month. And then three months. And then to this moment, writing this post: the conviction that I\u2019m ready to leave Coinbase and pursue new, more personal coding challenges and entrepreneurial endeavors. Is this the the \u201cright time\u201d to jump\u00a0ship? One of the biggest things we struggle with as entrepreneurs is knowing when \u201cthe right time\u201d is\u200a\u2014\u200athe right time to pursue that passion, the right time to shun reason in the name of fulfilling our dreams. But I\u2019ve come to realize that there is no rule book that will give us the answer. That the \u201cright time\u201d never comes\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can spend your whole life getting your checks and balances in order and it\u2019ll never feel \u201cjust right.\u201d There\u2019s always more you can do to prepare, get more experience, and minimize risk. \u2026But that doesn\u2019t mean we should. Our minds will always rationalize the fear of the unknown.\u00a0\u00a0So is now the right time for me to leave Coinbase? I honestly don\u2019t know for sure. In fact, a few of my close friends and mentors said that waiting until I get \u201c2 years of experience\u201d seems more appropriate. Or that \u201ctesting the waters\u201d by working at a small startup would be a better way to ease into it. Is it really, though? Or would that just be an excuse to escape the fear and uncertainty of doing it now. And here\u2019s my conclusion: I don\u2019t believe another six months or two years will make the answer any more clear. What I do know is that I feel more confident than ever in my skills as a software engineer. I\u2019m proud of everything I\u2019ve been able to learn and improve my skills at thanks to Coinbase, such as: And of course, there are tons of things I haven\u2019t learned yet\u200a\u2014\u200aand all the tantalizing things I\u2019ll probably never learn about programming. Ultimately, it\u2019s okay, because the most important skill I\u2019ve learned over the last two years is how to learn\u200a\u2014\u200athe master key to learning and conquering any tool, framework or language I need. This is all I ever wanted when I set out to go \u201clearn to code,\u201d and now I have it at my finger tips.\u00a0\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t I use these skills to build my own products full time? The answer is simple: \u201cwhy not.\u201d Life is too short not to experiment\u200a\u2014\u200aand the time to see what value I can create through those experiments is now, while I\u2019m young, driven, and the worst case scenarios aren\u2019t really that bad. As Leo Tolstoy puts it so eloquently: \u201cOnce we\u2019ve thrown off our habitual paths, we think all is lost; but it\u2019s only here that the new and the good\u00a0begins.\u201d So what\u2019s\u00a0next? Sapien.ai I\u2019m thrilled to share that I\u2019ll be joining Tony Marks and Sneha James as the co-founder and lead engineer of Sapien.ai. It\u2019s a small startup team, and the product we\u2019re building uses AI to build intelligent text and voice conversational interfaces for brands to reach potentially billions of new users across some of the most popular messaging and connected device platforms. Our vision is to embed intelligent brand experiences across various channels, mediums, and user intersections to form what we call the \u201cSapien layer.\u201d (Catchy, right?)\u00a0Having known Tony for over 6 months, I continue to be impressed by his incredible drive, hustle, and charisma. Our skills complement one another incredibly well, and I\u2019m excited to see what we can accomplish together. Moreover, Sneha is a brilliant engineer and I\u2019m looking forward to tackling many, many unforeseen technical challenges with her. We\u2019re confident that by joining forces, we can do something big. Or at the very least, die trying\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0As a co-founder and lead engineer, I\u2019ll be: Since making this decision, I\u2019m finally waking up every morning feeling passionate, charged, and motivated to build. I\u2019ll be writing and speaking about our product, clients, and the exciting new developments and challenges in the AI industry in the coming months. So if NLP, AI and bots pique your interest, stay tuned for more by subscribing to our newsletter!\u00a0\u00a0Teaching and\u00a0writing In addition to hacking away on our product, I\u2019ll continue to spend a portion of my time writing, teaching, speaking, and advocating JavaScript, the web, and functional programming. If leveling up your Functional JavaScript knowledge is on the to-do list, you can sign up for my free email course on The Fundamentals of Functional Programming. I\u2019ll also be creating a long-form video course called \u201cMastering Functional JavaScript\u201d later this year. What are the\u00a0risks? Any experiment comes with the risk of failure\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly high when it comes to startups since, after all, nine out of ten startups fail. That said, I believe that the personal and career \u201crisks\u201d of taking time to build a startup idea are way, way lower than we\u2019re lead to believe. Particularly as an engineer with no major family obligations, the worst case scenario for me is that I crash, burn, and take a new engineering job a few months later. Starting salaries are higher than most other industries, and there are always more engineering jobs available than qualified candidates to fill them. So yes, our startup could totally fail 3, 6, or 12 months from now. Or we could run out of money in the process. Or we could get outrun by competitors. Or I could end up losing interest in my passions. Or I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. The list goes on. Do I have control over any of these events from happening? If I try my hardest, are any of them my fault? Probably not. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned through the major transitions in my life\u200a\u2014\u200afrom moving across continents, countries, and cities, to becoming financially independent at 18, to hustling my way into Silicon Valley, to conquering my dream of becoming a programmer\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s that uncertainty motivates me to succeed. In a way, it\u2019s almost comfortable. In my eyes, the only true failure would be not starting in the first place. Looking forward I spent the last two years building a strong foundation as an engineer and more importantly, finding myself\u200a\u2014\u200amy passions, interests, strengths and weaknesses. The next stage of my growth will be all about taking that experience and creating something meaningful for the world out of it. I love the saying by Sidney A. Friendman: \u201cYou can achieve anything you want in life if you have the courage to dream it, the intelligence to make a realistic plan, and the will to see that plan through to the\u00a0end.\u201d I\u2019ve dreamt it, sketched out a realistic plan, and now it\u2019s time I see it through to the end. Now it\u2019s your turn: tell me about your journey. Have you ever felt unhappy with your day-to-day? What doubts keep you from chasing your dream\u200a\u2014\u200aor what steps have you taken to overcome them? Your story is just as important as mine. I can\u2019t wait to hear it!
