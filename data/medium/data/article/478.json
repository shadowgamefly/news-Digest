{"name": "478", "parent": "", "content": "Living and Parenting in Uncertain Times Uncertainty. Worry. Fear. These are still the top themes in most of my counseling sessions as a psychologist\u200a\u2014\u200awith adults, with teens, and even with children. Mainly, the discussions were about the presidential election, then it was about the winner of the election, and now it is about the very uncertain future. What will happen to immigrants? What will happen to trade policies? Will the right to choose disappear? Will gay marriage be overturned? What is going to happen with Russia? In my profession there is a saying that uncertainty breeds anxiety. I think most of us would agree with this statement. As I ponder and deal with these questions and concerns on a personal level, I\u2019m transported back to the fifth grade. I remember learning about nuclear bombs and nuclear war. I have vivid images etched into my brain of mushroom clouds and nuclear fall-out. I remember watching the movie The Day After full of fear. I remember nights awake in my childhood bed being scared of Russia bombing us and of dying. Perhaps worst of all my parents didn\u2019t know how scared I was because I didn\u2019t tell them\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact I didn\u2019t tell anyone. Fast forward to 2016. My wife and I are raising 3 teenagers. I can\u2019t help but ask myself: How much are they worrying about the future? Are they quiet because they don\u2019t want to tell me their real fears? Are they quiet because they think Mom and Dad can\u2019t possibly understand their feelings? These are the signs of raising children in uncertain times. As the year ends we are all having important and honest conversations with spouses and partners, family, and friends. How can we approach the new year and this uncertain world with positivity and peace? Here are 5 ways to curate daily well-being: The future is always uncertain\u200a\u2014\u200aHumans trick ourselves into feeling secure. We want to believe that we have control, that nothing bad will happen. These thoughts make us feel happy. But uncertain times challenge this strategy. So what can we do to conquer fear and feel peace and happiness? I suggest we accept and embrace the uncertainty\u200a\u2014\u200aforget the concepts of good or bad outcomes and instead focus on life is always changing and if we allow our minds to be at peace with the unknown then we can adapt to any challenge. History proves that humans adapt and survive\u200a\u2014\u200aOur human species has been evolving, adapting, and surviving for a very long time. It is in our DNA. Like our ancestors we can and will deal with our social, environmental, and political circumstances.

The present is the only thing that exists\u200a\u2014\u200aAll we have is the present. The now. I know this sounds clich\u00e9 these days as more and more people are trying to become mindful (which is a very good thing), but it is true.
