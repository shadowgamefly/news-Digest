Provisions We will provide you with the latest technology. Our motion sensor keypads will allow you to form paragraphs with the slightest of movements. We can\u2019t get into specifics because our techniques are proprietary, but we assure you that our products come with a money-back guarantee. Hunger and thirst will be retired. Most bodily functions will depreciate. You will be assigned a finite number of emotions so as to individualize your experience, but we will monitor your habits and adjust accordingly.

We miscalculated the appropriate dosage of desire, and as a result we experienced an unfortunate situation, a contagion. His banal encounter with Super User @felsull was misinterpreted; affection developed (one-sided, of course, because @felsull really didn\u2019t have the time since she accumulating one million Likes, Hearts and Fans!) that resulted in a virus that plagued all of The Blue. He literally gave her his heart and the virus nearly crashed our servers. Do you know how many cells there are in one human heart? Two billion. What a fucking disaster. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve taken the proper precautions to ensure an affliction of this magnitude doesn\u2019t occur again. We\u2019ve opened up call centers staffed with community managers who actively police the engagements with our most active members, top earners, and emerging talent. Emotions are modulated when appropriate. And yes, our call center staff has been allowed complete use of their limbs\u200a\u2014\u200aa small investment for the necessary work they do. You will have everything you need to start your new life in The Blue. Here is your Welcome Packet. We suggest you actually read it. A side note\u200a\u2014\u200asentimental types tend to carry over an article of clothing, a photograph, or a piece of furniture, and they will soon realize that these items are irrelevant in The Blue. Everyone assumed memory would be a given (it is not\u200a\u2014\u200abreath is the only default setting\u200a\u2014\u200aand we\u2019re tired of reminding you people of this), and one day they wake, confused. Who are those people in the picture? What is a picture? How do I know this word? There is an upholstered chair in the corner but you\u2019ve elected not to keep your legs so what\u2019s the point? What use do you have for that shirt when a chest cavity becomes extraneous? When a stomach is left off the list? Because of this, we remind everyone during the intake session: bring only what you need. Bring only that which is required to function. Over time you can win back the rest. May we remind you: twenty items. 20. Some ask: where do the items go? We respond how we always respond: they are returned to The Deserving. How else would we be able to run The Blue? Measures are needed to protect you from one another and those measures require resources, money. We exist to preserve life. Have you reviewed the contents of your Welcome Packet along with your New Identity Folder? You have been assigned an online identity, an avatar (we can make adjustments\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019ve found Photoshop to be useful), a social media presence (your starting point is determined by a number of factors including projected possibility of popularity, race, gender, age, and income), a set of interests, likes and dislikes\u200a\u2014\u200apersonal preferences, if you will\u200a\u2014\u200aand a library of rights-free images, fonts, popular vernacular, and emoticons. You\u2019ll enjoy monthly refreshes, and we can discuss your goals for personal growth during Quarterly Review. By now you\u2019ve heard the rumors about the disproportionate allocation of audiences. Let me assure you that these aren\u2019t rumors, they\u2019re facts, and that\u2019s what makes the game interesting. If everyone were equal what fun would that be? There\u2019s a race, gender and age hierarchy in your packet, but why bother reading what you already know. The good news is that The Blue can elevate your status. The challenges you complete and the points you accumulate will one day afford you the privilege of The Deserving. All the rules of engagement are detailed in your Packet. The goal is to be popular, be liked, and you do this by being what people wish they could be. Pictures and inspiring quotes only go so far\u200a\u2014\u200awe merely give you the tools in the toolbox, it\u2019s up to you to build your kingdom. You might have heard about the success stories and know that with an increase in your social status you get special privileges. We attach badges to your avatar and you get to change your font size and color. People will know you\u2019re special. Cliques, groups and fiefdoms are inevitable in The Blue because where there are thoughts and a means in which to express them (even in our strictly monitored and controlled environments), hierarchies will always exist. We encourage you to not engage in flamewars only if it is to your strategic advancement. Nobody likes a troublemaker, and due to recent budget cuts most of our community managers can\u2019t work overtime. 3. The Originals The first thing we lost was our voice. It slipped away in stages. Next were the pictures in the frames. All gone. Then the children vanished, one by one. No one noticed at first. Some of the mothers couldn\u2019t cry out for help (no voice), so they were forced to scream their sorrow on paper. They wrote in all-caps because this is still the easiest way to get someone\u2019s attention. The children were taken with their eyes half closed, in the space between sleep and awakening. We saw the fliers, the missing persons reports, and the websites showing the pictures that had been removed from the frames and a reward for the children\u2019s safe return. No one will ask questions, just give us back our children. Bring them home. One day we received printed notices sealed in white envelopes. We will give you back the children but we require something in return. We posted signs on our window detailing the terms of our surrender. Back then we didn\u2019t know we were prolonging the inevitable\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone is forced (or born) into The Blue. We were na\u00efve, desperate. We would do anything to return to normal. So we read about a program that promised a rebirth. Imagine being born into a virtual world where pain ceased to exist. There would be no pestilence, famine, corruption, environmental catastrophe, or war. The whole of your life would exist within the confines of a 7x7 room\u200a\u2014\u200aa virtual bunker that would shield us from the physicality of the natural world. The room would have no windows, only walls that served as screens. We pictured an existence free of Republicans, Christian fundamentalists, global warming, telemarketers, reality TV shows, eyeliner, stamps, parking tickets, kale, and junk mail. We were locked in a room for a trial period. Over the years we experienced a gradual, careful loss. Items from our person were being removed and we didn\u2019t register their loss until the next item vanished. You notice a nail gone when a whole thumb goes missing\u200a\u2014\u200athat sort of thing. We never discuss the accumulations, even after the years following our release, because how could we? How could we explain the negligence that occurs when whole parts of our bodies vanished? How could we comprehend that we don\u2019t remember the children we spent ten years in a room trying to reclaim? Was it worth it? When we were paraded out in front of our children to say our goodbyes, some parents blinked onto their screens: I\u2019m sorry. Do you belong to me? I don\u2019t remember you. Why are you making this sacrifice? You hardly remember us. Later we learn that the children were told that we would say this. They were encouraged to nod politely and ignore us, as teenagers are prone to do. You\u2019re probably wondering why no one\u2019s crying. Simple\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t mourn what we don\u2019t remember missing. Weeping feels futile when our emotions have been excised so cleanly and completely. We don\u2019t wonder where hearts originate. When we were released and labeled The Defective, our children were shuttled into our rooms to take our place. They were promised fully functioning parents, an all-expenses-paid re-assembly, if they were to participate in the beta. The Deserving required additional observational data. We want clocks so we\u2019ll know when our time is up! The children\u2019s demands were indulged because they bordered on adolescence, and part of our job required this level of entertainment. The children didn\u2019t know about the vanishings\u200a\u2014\u200athey didn\u2019t foresee the taxonomy of things they would slowly, inevitably lose. They were told their parents were an experiment gone wrong, an anomaly. No one tells the children where we end up. They don\u2019t see the advertisements regarding the opening of our exhibit. How the rooms they\u2019ve now been locked in have been recreated in excruciating detail and how we\u2019ll spend the rest of our days trapped in them. They don\u2019t hear the promises to The Deserving\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re doing this all for you! Everyone is lead to believe that The Blue is a sanctuary. No one sees that The Deserving never receive Welcome Packets. They aren\u2019t invited to the Open Houses. No one accounts for the fact that The Deserving have bonfire parties where they laugh over the items that have been surrendered and discarded. In moments they snatch up the items that take months for The Defective to give away. We tell The Deserving to not be greedy, they are in the minority and there\u2019s enough to go around. New Defectives are born for The Blue every day. 4. Call Center Log. Incident #4232.12A @nadia tries to jump out of a window, only there were no windows, only walls, and @nadia doesn\u2019t have legs or feet but that doesn\u2019t stop her from trying\u200a\u2014\u200anot hard enough it seems. We see her cursor making a kicking motion. We watch her paint her blue room black out of protest. We record her not logging on for 3 days and 2 hours. During that time she processes forms to change her avatar to a photo of the dog she was forced to leave behind\u200a\u2014\u200aa Pomeranian that sleeps with one of The Deserving at night. When there\u2019s a server outage, @nadia can sometimes see the photos posted by those on the Outside. The puppy she held in her hands now sleeps beside a little girl with red hair. @nadia knows this because the mother posts photos of her sleeping daughter online for everyone to see. It\u2019s an infraction to brag about items redistributed, and the mother will get fined at the most and receive a stern email at the very least, but in the end @nadia blames herself because her dog was not one of the twenty. On the fourth day she offers @mikey her badges in exchange for a window with a view\u200a\u2014\u200ashe\u2019s read about the infamous @mikey in the underground forums. But @mikey is a mole, a spy, a low-level agent of The Deserving, and he posts unflattering photos of @nadia as punishment for her infraction. @nadia unfollows people; she blocks them and joins a forum instructing people on how to delete. Burn your manual. We\u2019ll show you how to secure a dignified end. @nadia: Kevin, can you do me a favor and turn off the fucking cameras? Give a woman a little privacy, would you? Operator Kevin Gray: @nadia, you know I can\u2019t do that. @nadia: We all know about the budget cuts, the infighting on the Outside. There\u2019s no one around to monitor you. They\u2019re too busy fighting over the leftovers. Operator Kevin Gray: We\u2019ve been keeping track\u2026 @nadia: There\u2019s no we; there\u2019s only you. Operator Kevin Gray. And last time I checked all your limbs were intact\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have the privilege of being a person, while I\u2019m a screen name, a thing in a room with 20 objects down to 15. My memory was #13 of 20, and sometimes I wish I\u2019d brought Lacy instead of that. Operator Kevin Gray: (sighs) You know they wouldn\u2019t have allowed a complete pet. Nothing living arrives in tact. Love is what\u2019s abandoned because there aren\u2019t enough numbers to bring something as large as that in. @nadia: (photograph disappears; she starts the download) Stay with me while I delete. Operator Kevin Gray: Don\u2019t fuck this up. You\u2019ve got a good set-up here. @nadia: This is good? All I see is a prison with an Internet connection. I lost an eye five minutes ago and I didn\u2019t even know it. Do you know what that\u2019s like? To live each day in fear of what will be missed? Operator Kevin Gray: You know I can\u2019t allow that. You know \u2014 @nadia: I know, what? That we\u2019re The Deserving\u2019s entertainment? That we\u2019re what they watch now that televisions have been taken away? That we\u2019ll never earn our way out\u200a\u2014\u200athe badges, hearts, and numbers are a mountain of false hope. Operator Kevin Gray, we know. We know that we\u2019ll lose our twenty over time. We know that we\u2019ll be replaced and our fans redistributed and our hearts bled back to white. A lot of us have been afraid for a long time, and fear was the one emotion you forgot to modulate maybe because you suspected we would never figure you out. A lot of us know who you are, what we really are, and we\u2019re telling as many as we can. You forgot, Operator Kevin Gray. #18 was my intelligence. #19 was my dignity. Operator Kevin Gray admires @nadia so you have to know that he doesn\u2019t take the following events\u200a\u2014\u200athe gas and the injections after\u200a\u2014\u200alightly. But he has a duty. Even though she\u2019s one of The Original\u2019s children, a girl who spends her life confined to four screens, a ceiling and a floor, he has a purpose. Even though she forgets how heavy rain wrinkled her skin and how fireflies glowed hot in the night, he has a duty. Operator Kevin Gray wipes her browsing history clean and removes the photo of her puppy. When @nadia wakes the next morning she can\u2019t recall how she arrived at her room or why she has been placed there, she only knows that she\u2019s meant to turn on the computer and start accumulating. Nearly every everything of hers has vanished, and she will never remember what she had and subsequently lost. She\u2019ll never realize that Operator Kevin Gray is watching, that in the middle of the night, he retrieved and returned one of her eyes. A week later we start making our withdrawals from Kevin. He goes willingly, of course. He never asks why because he knows. His duty was to take orders and his purpose was to follow them. Operator Kevin Gray was never supposed to feel anything for The Defective. He wasn\u2019t supposed to feel anything at all. 5. The Situation on the Outside What do you mean they\u2019re bored? We\u2019ve got nearly the entire world population cut up and shut up in rooms and the children require additional amusements, further costume changes? Do you understand the sacrifices that have been made? The gods everyone had to forsake for The Deserving? There is no rewinding of the tape. Turning back is impossible. Let\u2019s dial down the dramatics. I\u2019m just saying that some are concerned about the methods that have been employed against some of the dissidents. Others have suggested that we\u2019ve taken The Blue too far\u2026 Now you have a conscience? Maybe you should have considered that before posting videos of your friends in The Defectives\u2019 houses, rummaging through their things, eating their food, and filling up your bodies with their organs. The past is past. Now we\u2019re wondering whether there\u2019s a middle ground, if there\u2019s something that we can give to appease them. Not enough for them to be dangerous, but something that allows them to be grateful. They trust you\u200a\u2014\u200athe sites and forums your company built\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re their sole connection to what\u2019s in and beyond The Blue. More like appease you, but let\u2019s say I sell the story of hope to The Defective. What do I get in return? Your men get their overtime. And you get what you\u2019ve always wanted. Recognition. Respect. Love. 6. Cracks One morning @nadia\u2019s Pomeranian attacks the little Deserving in her sleep. The parents call the hospital and are given a ticket number. We\u2019re in a war; a dog bite is considered low priority. Call us back when the dog mauls her and we\u2019ll bump her number up. Until then\u2026 When the father shouts, rattling off his title and rank of importance, the operator responds by blasting hold music. The daughter is bleeding and the wife insists that she\u2019ll need a transfusion. Already the woman is cutting herself and bleeding into a mason jar just in case. She\u2019s adopted; she\u2019s not even our blood type the father says. It would be just like you to remind me, the wife responds. Clearly your rank isn\u2019t that important. A week later the little Deserving dies from infection, and in her grief the mother curls up next the dog, dresses it, and calls it by the little girl\u2019s name. When the father kicks up a fuss, he\u2019s demoted and denied access to the country club. We\u2019re in the middle of a fucking war, the wife cries out. No one\u2019s playing golf. No one\u2019s asking for Glenfiddich on the rocks. I don\u2019t even understand why we\u2019re at war. Didn\u2019t we get rid of The Defectives? Everyone\u2019s the same\u200a\u2014\u200awhat\u2019s there left to fight about? And you wonder why your body wasn\u2019t built for children. The online publisher gets his overtime and a standalone show on all the premiere screens once the televisions becomes extinct, but one night he wakes in terror and writes on a piece of paper: This is what happens when you delete without a proper archive. Profiles and pages and photos and approvals deleted without burial. They work so hard to be one of the enviable and beloved. They spend days calibrating words and editing photos. They study and analyze the monthly data and trend reports and take fastidious notes during Quarterly Review. And yet we\u2019re deleting pages faster than we create new ones. We scrub down their rooms and incinerate any leftovers from the twenty. The Defective are only know for the duration of their online existence while people write and publish books about the brave Deserving who are dying in droves. Some amongst us\u200a\u2014\u200athe not so bright\u200a\u2014\u200acontemplate enacting a draft, a grand act of patriotism on behalf of The Defective. We are at war and need reinforcements. The idea nearly becomes law with opposing sides ready to make their picks like a game of grade school dodge ball, until we have to remind them that The Defective are no longer people. They\u2019ve donated their actual hearts for virtual ones because what use did they have for a heart that pumped blood through a whole archipelago of organs that now ceased to exist? They\u2019ve been taught to take only that which they need in order to grow their fanbase and prove they themselves worthy of someone\u2019s attention and love. Only then do they have a chance to recover what was discard before entering The Blue. Some make their gains based on their situation (who wouldn\u2019t throw an old woman dying of cancer a like or a team #followback? Who wouldn\u2019t give a toddler a re-pin, a re-tweet?) The new life and near dying have it easy while everyone in the middle has to work. In The Blue you learn quickly that you have to earn your keep. That knowledge makes your stronger even when everyone on the Outside grows soft, complacent, comfortable and weak. Some of The Deserving won\u2019t let this draft business go, and we nearly miss the screen showcasing The Defective who risked it all to bring in a kitten. It paid off because Pickles the Pink Kitten banked seventy million views on his series of Dear Defective videos\u200a\u2014\u200ahow-tos for those new to The Blue. Pickles\u2019 owner was one of the elusive few that managed to retrieve her hearing. Functioning ears! The day the rumor spread The Defectives re-gramed pictures of Pickles with the hashtag #goals. And we\u2019re missing the debut of the latest video because some Deserving with a donated Defective brain has a bright idea about drafting blinking cursors to do their dirty work. We are exasperated. What are you going to do? Book a conference room and have them tweet our enemies to death? You\u2019d be surprised what an online mob can do to an offline life. Remember that sweet picture of the little girl and the Pomeranian and how it went viral? You know what happened to that girl? Dead. Everyone remembers the dead little girl and the puppy that takes her place. I heard the dog took off her face! Lies, all lies, it was only a flesh wound and a father who got a lousy ticket and hold music. Hold music. One says: I know how we\u2019ll conquer our enemies. Put them in The Blue with hold music. Everyone gasps. The Blue is a war crime. We might as well behead and water-board while we\u2019re at it. 7. Fault lines Over the next year and during the war that would stretch for an additional ten, bodies begin to give out. Donated organs from The Defective become\u2026defective. Houses collapse and furniture rots, mushrooms bloom from the insides of cushions and along the walls. Wallpaper peel and animals keel over. Land that was once fertile expels fumes. Flowers recoil and vegetables turn to ash. It\u2019s as if everything that has been taken from The Defective expires when they do. Sometimes people wake to see The Defectives\u2019 fingers under their doors or crawling up from the floorboards. Long after the books about The Deserving have been burned and everyone discusses the return of the abacus and Paleolithic diets, there exists a small community of young Blues who archive. We are the minority and we\u2019re dying while The Defective replicate and reproduce online. We are dying and times are changing and our children, who remember the girl who got bit by the dog and the parents who did nothing, begin to realize that maybe we got it wrong. Maybe we\u2019re the ones who needed to be contained. Maybe those in the Blue are the beautiful ones\u200a\u2014\u200afragile, refined parts of a person trying to be a person, trying to live and project the very best of their sad and tragic life.
