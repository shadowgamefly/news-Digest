The brainchild of Rob Walling and Mike Taber, this event bucks the startup trend: it\u2019s not for venture-funded companies. \u201cMicroConf is a great place to meet like-minded people who are self-funding their businesses. It\u2019s one of the best places to make friends with other people in the same situation as you. In fact, it is one of the few places you can do that!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHiten Shah I recently hosted a pre-MicroConf hangout: Some great people showed up: Josh Earl, Brian Hogg, Jacob Thurman, Josh Doody, Ryan Battles, and Ben Orenstein. Together, we came up with these tips for attendees: Come for the \u201challway\u00a0track.\u201d The \u201challway track\u201d refers to hanging out with other attendees outside of the main talks. People repeatedly cite it as the best part about MicroConf. Here are a few things to remember: Make a plan for who you want meet, and what topics you want to discuss. If you have specific folks you\u2019d like to ask questions of, write a list of their names and what topic you\u2019d like to discuss. Pro tip: add yourself to this Who is coming to MicroConf? list and connect with people ahead of time! But\u2026 also be open to meeting \u201csleeper attendees.\u201d At any event, there\u2019s always people everyone wants to talk to, and then there are folks who aren\u2019t as well-known. Outside of the bloggers, podcasters, and \u201cinternet famous\u201d people you\u2019ve heard of, there are tons of amazing entrepreneurs at MicroConf, with awesome stories to tell. Rehearse your answer to: \u201cwhat are you working on?\u201d People at MicroConf are curious! They\u2019ll want to know what you\u2019re working on. Don\u2019t be self-conscious. Just tell them about your main project, or pitch them on your business idea. One idea is to host a reception in your room during the evenings. Buy some drinks, and give out personal invitations (be sure to invite a wide variety of people!) Breakfast can be a great opportunity to meet new people. Wander down to the Beach Cafe in the morning, and ask to join a table! Be vulnerable. You don\u2019t need to pretend at MicroConf. If you\u2019re struggling with something, share it with others! It\u2019s likely other people have been where you\u2019re at now. Be open and honest; no need to fake it. The hallway track is the best part of MicroConf. The talks MicroConf talks are packed with tactics. Want to get the most out of them? Leave your laptop in your room. It\u2019s way too easy to get distracted during a talk by Slack, your email, and other work that needs to be done. Bring a pen and paper, or write notes on your iPhone. You don\u2019t need to take photos of each slide. Most speakers make their slides available afterwords, and the talks are also recorded. Kai Davis also writes notes at microconfrecap.com. Enjoying a talk? Let the speaker know! Quote a notable line on Twitter (use the #microconf hashtag), or tell them afterwards. Giving a\u00a0talk? MicroConf is unique in that there are keynote talks as well as talks from attendees. Here are some tips for speaking at MicroConf: Hotel, taxi and\u00a0travel My friend Jimmy Jacobson, of Wedgies, lives in Las Vegas. Here is his advice: You can use Uber or Lyft at the airport, but just make sure you pay attention to the notice that they will pick you up on level 2M of the parking garage (that\u2019s one level up from passenger pickup). If you are cool with a taxi, then just follow the signs to the taxi stand. It\u2019s fast and efficient as well. The Cosmopolitan is reasonably close to Tropicana and has one of the only non chain coffee shops on the strip. It also has some good but reasonably priced eats (for the strip). Also, Mike Taber just reminded me of this important tip: If the taxi driver asks if you want to take the highway, say no. The highway goes south out of the airport and then all the way around the airport. Not applicable to Uber or Lyft, since they\u2019re much better about not ripping you off because of maps and such.
