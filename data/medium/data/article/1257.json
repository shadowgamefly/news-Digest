{"name": "1257", "parent": "", "content": "{27}Getting paid to write on\u00a0Medium. It\u2019s not how you\u00a0think. Ok so please forgive the clickbait worthy title, but I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot since the whole Partnership/Member debacle unfolded. It\u2019s been a much discussed topic here and elsewhere that artists of any ilk are very much undervalued. For writing in particular, the rise of clickbait and listicles and junk journalism is doing even more to undermine those who actually try to refine our skills and craft. Passion is not rewarded; clicks are. When Medium rolled out its Membership to some and Partnership to even fewer, I realized how true this really is. While certainly there are medium \u201csuperstars\u201d who have hundreds of thousands of readers, there are many of us who have a few thousand\u200a\u2014\u200aor even a few hundred\u200a\u2014\u200areaders that nonetheless still bring readers to the site daily. Some of us are only readers, commenting occasionally, if ever, and simply recommending that others join the community to be exposed to thinkers, poets, and writers you won\u2019t find anywhere else. And yet\u2026 And yet, Medium seems intent on rewarding those who create content that can be found, let\u2019s face it, anywhere else on the internet. There are plenty of sites where you can find listicles and pseudo-inspirational crap for those days when you feel like you need a kick in the ass. I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not why I come here. The pieces that I\u2019ve read and have haunted or inspired me have not been the ones that promise 37 Ways to Be More Productive Before 3:27 AM or 15 Ways to Make Your Asshole Smell Like Fine Wine\u200a\u2014\u200athey have been heartfelt, heart wrenching, authentic pieces that were raw, unique, and relatable. I want more of this. I want to be able to, if I want to contribute five bucks to a writer, know that my money is going to the writer that inspired me\u200a\u2014\u200anot the one that slammed out an article that\u2019s been written fifteen times and is being passed around facebook every three days. I think, in a way, this was the thing Medium has completely misunderstood about its unique value. I think that this is where their attempts to monetize really missed the mark and actually caused a lot of us to feel alienated and kind of used. And then, I read this thought by Jim Reeves: This. Very few writers that I like ask for donations, even when I\u2019m sure it might help them expand\u2026medium.com What a brilliant thought! I don\u2019t always have the extra money at the end of the month to commit to a monthly payment, but wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to bookmark the piece that kept me awake at night or that kept coming back to me during a long drive and, when I had the extra money, send that writer a few bucks in thanks? Wouldn\u2019t that be a unique service to provide\u200a\u2014\u200aa way to support the actual writers we read? Shit, Medium could even slap a fee on the way PayPal does and still make money off of us if they wanted to, but could revolutionize this Facebook era trend where millions of us create content on sites for free and never have a chance at being compensated. However, since it is doubtful that medium will create such a program on their own, here\u2019s what I propose: Set up a PayPal account. Figure out how to link it to your stories (I\u2019m working on it), and do so. I know, I know\u200a\u2014\u200aI have thought about this and felt (and still feel) uncomfortable doing it. I don\u2019t know if what I have to offer is good enough to ask for compensation, and I know that most of the folks who are good enough to read my writing don\u2019t have money to toss around. But I\u2019ll tell you this, fellow writers: I value your words. So many of you have written the exact words I needed on a bad day, or given me inspiration on an uninspired one, or made me laugh on a joyless one. I know the green heart means the world, but if I could buy you a cup of coffee or a beer or the extra guacamole on your burrito, I would love to\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it\u2019s just once. Medium provided us the unique opportunity to create a community and we did. We found its true value, and in fact, created it ourselves. I\u2019m not saying we should all throw money around, but let\u2019s value ourselves, our work, our words enough to say, \u201cHey. If you\u2019re here and you\u2019re reading and you want to, here\u2019s a way to support the writers that make this community special.\u201d So. Listen. If you\u2019re here and you\u2019re reading and you want to, here\u2019s a way to support the writers that make this community special.
