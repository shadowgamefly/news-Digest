As a quick aside, when I searched for \u201cmarketing your first book\u201d, the first result (note, my results are tailored to Canada, because that\u2019s where I\u2019m searching from. Yours may differ based on your search behaviour and location) provided a list of things to do in order to become a best-selling author (first-things-first, if they are promising \u201cbestseller\u201d status, run). Interestingly, \u201cWrite a Remarkable Book\u201d was sitting in spot #4, behind nuggets like \u201cstart a blog\u201d (check) and \u201cstart early\u201d. Early? As in, earlier than now? Early in life? But I digress (well, this whole post is a digression from what I should be doing, but that, too, is another story. This one, in fact). As a content strategist by trade, a former journalist and a would-be writer of fiction, one would think I am well-equipped to market my own material. Yes. One would. One (namely, me). And I am. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not constantly looking (read: procrastinating) for, and learning about new, innovative ways to market. Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples\u2026 Brent Underwood. He did what I, perhaps, should have done in the first place (i.e. filed under \u201cIdeas I wish were mine\u201d). He wondered what it would take to achieve \u201cAmazon Bestseller\u201d status, and he put his ideas into action. Behind the Scam: What Does It Take to Be a \u2018Best-Selling Author\u2019? $3 and 5 Minutes.I would like to tell you about the biggest lie in book publishing. It appears in the biographies and social media\u2026medium.com He chronicles some amazing, disturbing and downright depressing issues about the publishing (and writing) industry. [I]t\u2019s begun to feel a bit like a losing battle. Because those authors are everywhere these days. The title of my fake book was \u201cPutting My Foot Down\u201d for a reason: I\u2019ve become utterly exhausted with phony \u201cauthors\u201d and the scam artists and charlatans who conspire with these folks\u2013the cottage industry that has built up around them, selling courses, instructions and hacks. A quick Google search returns dozens of \u201cbestselling books,\u201d courses, packages, schools, secrets, summits, and webinars teaching you how to become a \u201cbestselling author\u201d.

Instead, maybe I just won\u2019t write a book at all, but launch a campaign around the idea for a book. If the campaign is a success, and there\u2019s enough interest (and, of course, pre-orders), then I\u2019ll actually write it. Kind of like Kickstarter or (ahem) Patreon. On to the next idea. Litbait. I love this. Well, the idea of this. Clickbait is horrible. Teasing, tricking and ultimately promising one thing but delivering another is a horrible way to engender interest in your product. Until now. This Bookstore's Clickbait Headlines on Facebook Are Actually the Plots of Classic NovelsDoes the end ever justify a means like clickbait? That's debatable. But a new contender in the discussion is Dallas\u2026www.adweek.com This tactic requires that I actually write a/the book, but that was the plan anyway, so no biggie. What The Wild Detectives, a bookstore, did was brilliant: using the plots of classic (copyright-free) novels as clickbait (litbait, get it?) to, of course, encourage reading but, perhaps more importantly, to \u201cremind people that there are way better things to read than clickbaity articles on the internet.\u201d \u201cBritish guy dies after selfie gone wrong\u201d (The Picture of Dorian Grey), \u201cTeenage girl tricked boyfriend into killing himself\u201d (Romeo and Juliet), \u201cWhen it\u2019s OKAY to slut shame single mothers\u201d (The Scarlet Letter) and\u200a\u2014\u200await for it!\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThis Italian politician makes Trump look like a saint\u201d (The Prince by Machiavelli\u00a0\u2026 which got as passionate a response as you can expect). (AdWeek) Be prolific. (Yes. I just said \u201cbe prolific\u201d). Remarkably, it\u2019s hard to find many authors and book publishers who really innovate when it comes to promoting their books. Self-published (self-publishing) authors are forced to be as creative or more in their marketing than they are in their fiction to stand out alone, but still, the larger story of why I should read their books often eludes them. Self-publishing writing duo Tim McBain and L.T. Vargus are examples of authors who grind. They don\u2019t stop. They\u2019ve chosen their channels of choice and they\u2019re doubling down on the message: Read. Our. Books. That\u2019s all they want. Read them. Not buy them. They (usually) give their books away. For free. They pump out newsletters (amusing reads). They are prolific on Twitter and they write manymanymany books. This is what it takes. I don\u2019t know how well they do, to be honest, but they win with sheer determination and pure volume of content alone. By \u201cwin\u201d I mean they at least pop up on my radar, which is more than many others can say. So, hopefully my own clickbaity title didn\u2019t lead you too far astray. True, I haven\u2019t really provided a content strategy, per se, for soon-to-be-but-as-yet-unpublished authors, but I\u2019m not done yet! The truth is, every author, every book, should have it\u2019s own, unique strategy. The plug-and-play, templated strategies and tactics that come out of large publishing houses are successful in spite of themselves. Not to say that there isn\u2019t value or merit in what an established, successful book-publishing-and-marketing machine has to offer, but it might be safe to say that we, as authors\u2014as those looking to get our material published and read by our desired audiences\u2014can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t rely on those tried-and-possibly-not-so-true-anymore tactics. We have to market ourselves. We have to tell our own stories. We have to tell the story of why you\u2019d want to read our stories. We have to build, establish and foster our network, our audience, and give them a reason to encourage others to become a part of it as well. Even if one signs with a big publisher, the days are gone when we could solely rely on their marketing clout, book tours and placement on shelves. So we have to create content around our content. We have to talk about our craft. What makes us tick. Our challenges and disappointments, and our wins. People buy into people, as well as their stories. I think. At least I do.
