{"name": "1256", "parent": "", "content": "{28} Today, I made\u00a0$3. It\u2019s the best $3 I ever\u00a0made. Queer as\u00a0a\u2026 When I put the paypal link at the end of yesterday\u2019s post, it wasn\u2019t with the expectation that anyone would use it; it was more to a) challenge myself to accept that my work has intrinsic value, maybe, to someone, and to b) do something that I think we all should consider doing. It didn\u2019t seem right to come out and be all, \u201cHey we should all do this!\u201d and then, you know. Not do it. So over the course of the day, a few people sent in a few dollars\u200a\u2014\u200athe very first few dollars I\u2019ve ever made from words. Possibly the only dollars I\u2019ll ever make from words. And I have to tell you: I have had permagrin all day. I could not expect the rush of emotion I got. There were, I\u2019ll admit, tears. I texted my mom when the first one rolled in and she texted back, \u201cYou\u2019re a writer now.\u201d Indeed. Ya\u2019ll, if you never thought people value your words, please consider doing this. Not only because it\u2019s a way to re-shape a community into one where people have an option to exchange real-life value for real-life words (rather than the somewhat hollow, content-driven mess the internet has quickly turned into), but because I don\u2019t think, if you\u2019ve never had the dollar for word exchange thing, you can imagine what it means. It means so much. To those who felt moved to drop a few bucks into my paypal account yesterday (I won\u2019t call you out, but you know who you are), thank you. So much. Some day I\u2019ll have better words than that, but today, please know how very much it meant to me. I still feel weird putting this at the end of posts, but I\u2019m going to keep doing it because it\u2019s so hard for me. Contribute if you wish, but definitely please consider putting your own link on your work. Your words have value. \u2764 Pay Kimberley Saumell using PayPal.MeGo to paypal.me/ZeldaPinwheel and type in the amount. Since it's PayPal, it's easy and secure.
