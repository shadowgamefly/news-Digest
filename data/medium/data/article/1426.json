I\u2019m excited to announce I will be an Adjunct Instructor this Spring in the Gatton College of Business & Economics at the University of Kentucky. I will be teaching an Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship course. A ton of headway has been made in Kentucky as it pertains to the cause of social entrepreneurship and impact investing but we still have a long way to go. That is why it is even more exciting to be joining (in a small way) the team at the University of Kentucky as they also announced just recently Nate Morris of Rubicon Global as an Entrepreneur-In-Residence with the goal to establish a Center for Social Entrepreneurship. Hopefully soon, Kentucky will be a national leader in creative strategies for solving community and environmental problems. For those of you that have taught this type of course before\u2026 I would love to hear your thoughts on resources and/or case studies. It is intended to be a highly practical semester so any and all suggestions are welcome!
