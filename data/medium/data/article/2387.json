My new manager at Google asked me to draft my OKRs for him to review. I had no idea what he was talking about. I\u2019ve now gone through the process of setting my Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) 24 times, and each time I marvel at what an effective mechanism they are for focusing my effort as well as aligning my work with the company\u2019s objectives. Last fall, I led a workshop about OKRs at the Startup Lab, which we\u2019re making public today. John Doerr originally presented OKRs to Google\u2019s leadership in 1999 when Google was less than a year old, and they\u2019ve been in use ever since. In the video, I present a portion of John\u2019s original deck, then lay out how we\u2019ve implemented them at Google over the years. I also shared a few of my OKRs from my time as a Product Manager on Blogger, and answered some questions from the employees at our portfolio companies who were present for the workshop. Though the video goes into more detail, here are a few keys to what make OKRs work at Google: One comment: in talking recently with one portfolio company who\u2019s implemented OKRs, I realized that I should have been more emphatic in pointing out that OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations. OKRs are about the company\u2019s goals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance evaluations\u200a\u2014\u200awhich are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period\u200a\u2014\u200ashould be independent from their OKRs. We\u2019ll cover employee evaluations in an upcoming workshop.
