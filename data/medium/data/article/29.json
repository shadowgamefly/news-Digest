Russell Westbrook and James Harden are testing what voters value more. Does the award need to go to a player on a contender, or is Westbrook\u2019s ground-breaking performance enough to earn it? Bill Simmons, who has an MVP vote, discussed the conundrum with Joe House on the latest Bill Simmons Podcast. Listen to the full podcast here. This transcript has been edited and condensed. Westbrook\u2019s Surge Might Put Him Over the\u00a0Top Bill Simmons: I\u2019m not ready to make a decision yet. I wrote about Westbrook a [few weeks] ago and since then he\u2019s single-handedly won three games by himself. Two he pulled out of the deep recesses of Oklahoma City\u2019s sphincter. It was all the way in and he just reached in there and pulled them out. And then [Wednesday] he had 45, 9, and 10, and they beat Memphis by three. It just feels like he\u2019s peaking at the end here, and there\u2019s recency bias, but also he\u2019s peaking because he wants to win the award and he wants to finish with a triple-double [average], and he\u2019s actually delivering. Whereas Harden [and the Rockets] totally outplayed Oklahoma City on Sunday on ABC\u200a\u2014\u200aI watched that game for three quarters, [and] Westbrook put up a bunch of cheap stats in the fourth quarter when the game was over. And I left that game thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s over, Harden won the MVP.\u201d Harden hurts his wrist at the end of the game, has not been the same since, he left the door a crack open; Kawhi hasn\u2019t been shooting as well since the All-Star break. He might have had a chance, if he really played lights out, but he just hasn\u2019t. LeBron, that team went in the tank for some degree there, they rallied back [Wednesday] night, but they have not played well. Kevin Durant almost broke his leg and he\u2019s been out, so he\u2019s out of the running. Isaiah Thomas can\u2019t win. And the more I stare at this, I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck, am I going to have to vote for Westbrook?\u201d I hate when it seems like guys are chasing stats. I don\u2019t like voting for MVPs that aren\u2019t on a team that I think can win the title. I can only remember doing that one other time, with Kobe in \u201906, and there were just no other candidates. I felt like, by default, I had to vote for him. Joe House: That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m curious to take a one-level-deeper dive with you on your thinking [as] to why it is that Westbrook, and you mentioned recency bias, has asserted himself in such a way that would change your overall philosophy. I think there is a very good reason that over the course of recent NBA history, no MVP has come from a team that\u2019s won less than 50 games. The MVP is a mantle, it\u2019s an important stamp for the league. Westbrook is fascinating and deserves all of the credit that he is receiving. It\u2019s eye-opening, it\u2019s mind-boggling what he is achieving. But at the end of the season, it strikes me as not much more than a neat curiosity. Video: NBA MVP Attack AdsA close look at Westbrook, LeBron, Kawhi, and Hardentheringer.com Does Being on a Contender Matter? House: Oklahoma City was forecast before the season started as a 44-win team, and they\u2019re going to come in around 46, 47. Houston was also forecast to come in in the mid-40s, and they\u2019re going to be 12 or 13 or 14 games better. And Harden has been the straw stirring that drink from the minute the season started. He\u2019s been on a relentless redemption tear. That team has genuine ambitions and genuine aspirations to threaten the Western Conference. You think that Houston has the best chance of challenging the Warriors in the West. Simmons: I do. House: Much better than the Spurs. Is it just the fact that [Westbrook is] going to end up averaging a triple-double and it\u2019s such a unique mark that you think he deserves the recognition of the league mantle? Simmons: I hate triple-doubles, it just seems like a totally arbitrary number to me. If somebody has 38 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 assists and somebody else has 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, the triple-double is the one that gets the pat on the back? I don\u2019t get that, it\u2019s just fucking arbitrary. Rebounds Might Make the Difference House: The thing that\u2019s going to keep Harden from averaging a triple-double this season is about 160 rebounds. So that\u2019s a little less than two rebounds a game. It\u2019s not a huge leap. Simmons: That\u2019s the thing. From an assist-points standpoint, they\u2019re pretty much even, and Harden just shoots better. Westbrook has taken 350 more field goals than anybody else in the league. So he takes over four shots a game more than anybody else in the league. He\u2019s also averaging 10 free throws a game. His usage rate is almost 42 percent, which is by far the highest total in the history of the league. His assist rate is 57. I laid this all out when I wrote the Westbrook column a few weeks ago. Nothing has really changed from the ball-dominance standpoint. Harden has just done it more efficiently. The difference is that Westbrook is getting these two and a half, three extra rebounds a game. The Russell Westbrook ProblemThe most amazing athlete in the NBA? The biggest ball hog in history? Oklahoma City\u2019s triple-double machine could be\u2026theringer.com I will say, this is a credit to Oklahoma City, the team wants him to get the rebounds. On free throws, you see the two [Thunder] guys box out their guys so Westbrook can come get it. It\u2019s a smart play because you want your point guard to get the ball and go or to be throwing the outlet pass to him. They want him to get these 10 rebounds a game. My question is, \u201cShould that swing the MVP?\u201d If he was at eight rebounds a game, I don\u2019t know if it would totally be in the conversation. But It\u2019s Westbrook\u2019s Season Simmons: Here\u2019s the other part to this: He\u2019s resonating with fans in a different way than Harden does. I think that has to count for something when you think about MVP. I think we\u2019re going to remember this as the Westbrook-Durant season. Ten years from now, it\u2019ll be like what was the \u201916\u201317 season? Oh, that was the Westbrook-Durant season. That was the year Westbrook [averaged] a triple-double [and] Durant left to go to Golden State. He\u2019s more fun to watch than Harden. [Houston\u2019s offense is] the same thing every time. He\u2019s out in the front, everybody is standing there. Westbrook, at least, he does the fast breaks, I think he\u2019s a little more fun game to game than Harden is. [People] love that he\u2019s a man possessed and a man scorned, so the story line is a little bit sexier than the Harden thing. I get the Westbrook thing. [But] I just can\u2019t wrap my head around voting for MVP for somebody who has no chance to win the title.
