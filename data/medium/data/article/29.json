{"name": "29", "parent": "", "content": "The Ringer\u2019s Unreal NBA\u00a0Ballot Bill Simmons and friends look back on the best Woj scoop, the best in-game dunker, the most improbable turnaround, sweet Jokic passing, the glories of Waiters Island, and much\u00a0more If you were expecting to read my choices for Most Valuable Player, All-NBA and every other major NBA award on the official ballot, you\u2019ll have to wait until next week. What about the unreal ballot? What about the real heroes of the NBA regular season\u200a\u2014\u200aguys like Chandler Parsons, Alan Anderson, Dion Waiters, Joel Embiid and Jusuf Nurkic, the ones who kept us engaged every time the A-listers weren\u2019t playing? What about the overachievers, underachievers and head-scratchers? What about the unintentional-comedy and irrational-confidence MVPs? My Ringer teammates Chris Ryan, Shea Serrano and Jason Concepcion and I honored these greats by slapping together the Ringer Independent Spirit Awards for the 2016\u201317 NBA season. 1. The Lou Brown Award for Overachieving Team That Surprised You\u00a0Most Bill Simmons: Shouldn\u2019t we be a little more collectively stupefied by the 2017 Bucks? The Freak becoming a top-12 player? No Khris Middleton, then no Jabari Parker\u00a0\u2026 and they\u2019re fine? Matthew Dellavedova, Tony Snell and Greg Monroe as valuable role players? Thon Maker looking increasingly\u00a0\u2026 competent? The Rookie of the Year (maybe)\u00a0\u2026 Malcolm Brogdon???? Jason Kidd pulling the strings without a tie? Jeff Schwartz pulling the GM strings without the actual GM title? 43\u201344 wins and a 5-seed? What? How? Why? Jason Concepcion: In December, Miami Heat bossman Pat Riley went on local sports radio and, using a flurry of euphemisms that sounded like a mob boss discussing a hit over an open phone line, admitted that his plan was to tank. \u201cI think the number-one asset that we have right now is our flexibility moving forward.\u201d Ashing his cigar. \u201cWe have a first-round pick this year.\u201d Smoothing the front of his track suit. \u201cSo we\u2019re dealing with it.\u201d You understand what I\u2019m telling ya? \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with that word that you hate to use\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aTell us, Don Patricio\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthat we have to rebuild. But we will rebuild quick.\u201d Yeah, sure, sure. Suffice to say, everyone, including the iconic Mr. Riley, has been surprised by the Heat. They are the surprise of the season. Miami is contending for the playoffs (!!!). There are a variety of factors behind this: Glengarry Dion Waiters subprime island real estate maturing into a legitimate beachfront resort property; Goran Dragic recapturing his late-period Phoenix Suns form; Hassan Whiteside, whose entire NBA career is a series of improbable events, continuing to do Hassan Whiteside things; a slimmed-down 30-year-old James Johnson putting up career numbers; Tyler Johnson in general. Don\u2019t act like you aren\u2019t surprised too. 2. The We Believe Warriors Award for Most Improbable Turnaround Bill: Instead of giving this to the Heat (too easy), I\u2019m giving it to Svelte James Johnson, who magically transformed his body from 275 pounds and 14.5 percent body fat to 238 pounds and 6.75 percent body fat AS THE SEASON WAS GOING ON. You see it happen every Survivor season, but during an NBA season with a multimillionaire who already got paid? James Johnson is definitely hiding an immunity idol in his pants. Shea Serrano: Imagine all the worst things you can think of. Picture them. Close your eyes and really see them. Got it? OK, good. Now put them all on a list. And now take that list, and at the top of it write: \u201cThese Are All Things That Were Better Than Watching The Houston Rockets Play During The 2015\u201316 Season.\u201d No team was less enjoyable to be around, to watch, or to experience than the Rockets. Do you remember the magic that the Warriors had as they rolled toward 73 wins? OK, the Rockets were like the counterpoint to that. The players openly hated each other (James Harden vs. Dwight Howard was the most passive-aggressive Greek tragedy I\u2019ve ever seen), the coach openly hated the team, the fans openly hated everything. The Rockets went from making the Western Conference finals for the first time in two decades the season before, to, I mean, they were basically just like if you poured a big bucket of acid down a slide at a playground. That\u2019s what they were like. This season, though? A complete and total turnaround. Harden is all of a sudden one of the four best basketball players on the planet again. New coach Mike D\u2019Antoni has them scoring 215 points a game. Literally every single meaningful statistic by which you would measure how good or bad a basketball team is has improved over last season. I wonder what the difference is. I wonder what the missing 6-foot-11, 265-pound difference is. 3. The Unicorn of the\u00a0Year Bill: With apologies to the Freak (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m voting for him for second-team All-NBA), the Joker (a legit threat to recreate the \u201977 Blazers) and the Zinger (who spent the season in Melo-Rose purgatory), I\u2019m voting for Joel Embiid, a 7-foot-2 behemoth with 3-point range who averaged 20 and eight in 25 minutes a game, sent Sixers fans into a Process tizzy, never even cracked the 800-minute mark, then disappeared. Did we imagine it? Did Joel Embiid even exist? That\u2019s a true unicorn\u200a\u2014\u200awhen you don\u2019t even know if it happened. Jason: The usage of \u201cunicorn\u201d as it pertains to the NBA is interesting. It\u2019s come to mean: 7-footer (or thereabouts) with guard-type skills. Mythical, magical cryptozoological creatures are supposed to be rare. And they are\u00a0\u2026 sort of. Current unicorns include Karl-Anthony Towns (a bona fide inside-outside savage), Anthony Davis (makes 50\u201320 games look effortless), Giannis Antetokounmpo (god help this plane of reality if he ever gets his jumper working), my son Kristaps (has taken a worrying step back that I blame fully on the Knicks\u2019 institutional ineptitude), and, the UotY, Nikola \u201cJoker\u201d Jokic. Here are the top-five PER seasons by players 21 years old or younger: 2014\u201315 Anthony Davis: 30.8 1993\u201394 Shaquille O\u2019Neal: 28.5 2005\u201306 LeBron James: 28.1 2013\u201314 Anthony Davis: 26.5 2016\u201317 Nikola Jokic: 26.2 (tied with 2009\u201310 Kevin Durant) NIKOLA JOKIC IS MAKING HISTORY! 4. The White Chocolate Award for Most Creative\u00a0Passer Bill: Was there a bigger League Pass revelation than Jokic\u2019s nightly Sabonis/Walton routine? He will single-handedly make Gary Harris an extra $50 million this summer. My dream NBA lottery order: Boston lands the first pick, Denver jumps into the second pick, the Lakers fall out of the top three (and lose their pick to Philly)\u00a0\u2026 and we get 12 to 15 years of Jokic and Lonzo joining forces to create the greatest passing team since God decided that Bill Walton could stay healthy for one season to play with Larry Legend. Sign me up. Jason: Nikola Jokic\u2019s passes are like underwear at the Playboy Mansion: filthy, varied, and silky. Two or three times a game, Jokic throws the pass that I consider to be his signature dime: a loping, feather-light changeup that crests a defender\u2019s fingertips and drops into a cutting teammate\u2019s hands as if it were placed there by the stork. His flashiest assist is a Larry Bird\u2013esque two-handed over-the-head blindside flick that\u2019s as on the money as a dead president. His most utilitarian assist is a faked-jumper push pass that short-circuits a defender\u2019s central nervous system. Nikola Jokic: Best passing big man in the league; most entertaining passer in the league. 5. The Dwight Howard Award for Best Statistical Season From a Guy It Seems Miserable to Play\u00a0With Bill: Hey, everybody, it\u2019s Dwight Howard again! You\u2019re not gonna believe it, but he put up solid stats on a team that played OK for a while, then tailed off late thanks to chemistry problems, trade rumors and general apathy. As I said on my NBA awards podcast this week, Dwight Howard is the guy who spends six hours coughing on your cross-country flight. When you get sick within the next 48 hours, you don\u2019t know for sure that he did it, but you blame him anyway. That\u2019s every Dwight Howard season. Rob Hennigan\u2019s last two Magic acts should be trading for Chandler Parsons and bringing Dwight Howard home. Chris Ryan: Chris Paul. His numbers have tailed off a bit from his 2011\u201312 Clippers high, but he\u2019s still in the top 10 in PER, averaging about 18 points and nine assists per game, and is quite clearly the best point guard of his generation and still one of the best two or three in the game. That being said, he kind of reminds me of Manchester United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. He\u2019s so smart, and understands his sport so well, that every foul call is an affront to good taste, and every defensive lapse is a blindingly obvious screw-up, and he takes it out on those around him. CP3 has made Blake and DeAndre into household names, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if those guys wanted to switch households. 6. Best Woj\u00a0Bomb Jason: Where were you when the Kings flipped the irascible, inconsistent, and devastatingly talented DeMarcus Cousins to the Pelicans for the impressively shitty return of Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and a first- and second-round pick? I know where Boogie was: IN NEW ORLEANS, FOR THE ALL-STAR GAME. It\u2019s almost like Vivek and Vlade didn\u2019t want to risk seeing Boogie in person ever again. In trading Boogie, the Kings brain trust, such as it is, effectively reversed Psalm 118:22, made famous by Bob Marley, among many others: \u201cThe stone that the builder refused / Will always be the head cornerstone.\u201d Vlade Divac proclaimed loudly and often that Cousins was untouchable, a cornerstone. The last statement came only two weeks before the trade. From the Pelicans\u2019 perspective, it\u2019s a fascinating time-travel experiment at a bargain-basement price. The league\u2019s best teams have long since committed to lineups featuring lone bigs anchoring four similarly sized players. New Orleans zigged hard, pairing the two best big men in the NBA in the seldom-seen twin towers format. If it doesn\u2019t work out, and early returns have ranged from scary-bad to inconsistent, the Pels can always let Boogie strut out of town. 7. The Carroll Dawson Award for Most Unabashed Tank\u00a0Job Bill: Kudos to the Suns for dropping 15 of their last 16 while enjoying a feel-good moment (Devin Booker\u2019s 70-pointer) and developing Tyler Ulis as their own version of The One That Got Away (Isaiah Thomas). Seriously, kudos. When you can tank AND build hope, that\u2019s the Tankapalooza 2017 dream personified. But nothing tops the Lakers for paying Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov $34 million this year combined to go away, then trotting out Metta World Peace for 17 minutes of an actual NBA game to blow this week\u2019s unexpected lead over the Spurs (and it didn\u2019t work\u200a\u2014\u200athey won!). Shea: There was a moment\u200a\u2014\u200athis was back in early in December or late November\u200a\u2014\u200awhen the Lakers looked like a not-terrible team. The Lakers Love BasketballHow Luke Walton made playing in purple and gold fun againtheringer.com I remember it because they got out to a super-surprising 10\u201310 start, and if that doesn\u2019t sound impressive, I\u2019ll remind you that in the prior season, they didn\u2019t win their 10th game of the season until February. Anyway, the Lakers looked decent, and it was all great and good and fun. And then all of the wheels fell off, and the engine fell out, and the doors caught fire, and then the back seats caught fire, too, and then Coach Luke just went ahead and decided to go on and drive their bus into the Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s fine, sure. I get it. Everyone does. The whole purpose of this season has been to get to the next season. The only thing I\u2019m sad about is that they actually are not in last place (they\u2019re in second to last place), and I need for them to be in last place so that Jonathan Tjarks can write a column about their rebuild during the offseason and call it \u201cThe Last and the Furious.\u201d 8. The Allan Houston Award for Dumbest\u00a0Contract Bill: After the 2016 Summer Spending Spree, you knew this category would be loaded\u200a\u2014\u200abut did you ever think the inexplicable Mozgov-Deng contracts and Joakim Noah\u2019s $73 million fiasco could take such a decided backseat to a much, much, much, much dumber contract? Grit \u2019n\u2019 Grind\u00a0\u2026 and $94 million of Chandler Parsons? An 82-game schedule\u00a0\u2026 and Chandler Parsons\u2019s ravaged knees? The city of Memphis\u00a0\u2026 and Chandler Parsons\u2019s Instagram account? When Mark Cuban says, \u201cThat contract is too risky,\u201d that\u2019s the basketball equivalent of Kris Jenner saying, \u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t do that; it\u2019s in bad taste.\u201d In other words, there\u2019s no bigger red flag. And Memphis plowed ahead anyway. The least they could do is make Parsons their overpaid color analyst or something. Jason: Joakim Noah played just 29 games in 2015\u201316, due to a panoply of shoulder injuries and the accrued effects of his never-say-die playing style amplified by Tom Thibodeau\u2019s sadistic tendency to crush his dudes under heaping piles of minutes. Jo also shot just 38 percent, a chilling number for a big, and turned a wizened 31 years old. But Phil Jackson\u2019s triangle-shaped heart wants what it wants, and he signed Noah to a four-year, $73 million contract. That\u2019s just what the Knicks do. Of course, the move has turned out to be an even deeper and darker money pit than it initially appeared. Noah was recently suspended for 20 games after testing positive for a banned substance, LGD-4033. Anytime you get the chance to take a suspect, over-the-counter dietary supplement with an active ingredient that sounds like what the Weyland-Yutani Corporation would name a planet, you simply must do it. Whatever. Shoot your shot. 9. The LaBradford Smith Award for Saddest NBA\u00a0Feud Bill: Shaq bullying JaVale McGee for reasons that remain unclear gets the nod, but don\u2019t sleep on Draymond Green\u2019s biting on-court trash talk at Paul Pierce during a Clips-Warriors game. You can\u2019t get no farewell tour, they don\u2019t love you like that. You thought you were Kobe? STOP THE FIGHT!!!!! By the way, Draymond\u2019s after-the-incident explanation\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cIf you gonna talk junk, I don\u2019t hold anything back when I\u2019m talking junk. If I\u2019ma talk, I\u2019ma talk. And I\u2019ma take it where it needs to go\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awould be a great high school yearbook quote for any of you young\u2019uns out there. 10. The Coach Bud Award for the Hiring That Inspired the Most \u201cGreat Hire\u201d\u00a0Tweets Bill: Ha: kenny atkinson great hire - Twitter SearchThe latest Tweets on kenny atkinson great hire. Read what people are saying and join the conversation.twitter.com Jason: The Wolves handing the horses, reins, and ranch to Tom Thibodeau. It was such a no-brainer that its greatness was obvious to plant life. He had coached the Bulls to four straight top-10 defensive seasons. If you take into account his days as an assistant, Thibs has been involved with 16 top-10 defenses dating back to 1996\u201397. The Wolves, meanwhile, had young wolf Karl-Anthony Towns, Canadian Kobe Andrew Wiggins, and a bunch of talented young players who don\u2019t really know how to play. Thibs has turned the likes of Nate Robinson and D.J. Augustin into LEGIT IMPACT PLAYERS WHO DID BIG THINGS IN ACTUAL PLAYOFF GAMES. Towns, Wiggins, Ricky Rubio and Kris Dunn have arguably as much raw talent as any four players he\u2019s ever coached. Several sober, professional and serious NBA analysts looked at this marriage and predicted 50 wins. Thibs\u2019s baby Timberwolves put up one of the worst defensive ratings in the league this season. Thibs has been his roaring, bellicose self, to little obvious effect. But these Timberpups have been receptive, even eager, for the challenge. KAT\u2019s general bad-assness, Rubio\u2019s recent streak of confident play, among other glimmers of light, keep the original premise\u200a\u2014\u200aGREAT HIRE\u200a\u2014\u200amuch in force. 11. The Ann Iverson Award for Best/Most Polarizing NBA Family\u00a0Member (Getty Images) Bill: Can we give it to LaVar Ball one year early? Did you ever think an NBA dad would be battling Stephen A. on First Take? Starting next season, LaVar Ball is locking up this award like The Daily Show locked up that decade of Outstanding Variety Show Emmys. Might as well give him one early. Honorable mention: Dennis Schr\u00f6der\u2019s mom, Austin Rivers, LeBron James Jr., Wanda Durant, Dwyane Wade\u2019s ex-wife. Shea: Without Googling, I honestly do not know one single thing about DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s brother, Jaleel. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s an older brother or a younger brother. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a blood brother or an adopted brother. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s an only brother or if there is a gaggle of Cousins boys running around. I don\u2019t know any of that. The only thing that I do know is that when Andy Furillo, a reporter from the Sacramento Bee, mentioned Jaleel in an column, DeMarcus got very upset and confronted him, cussing at him and yelling at him and pointing his finger at him. That, to me, seems like enough for him to win this award. 12. The Shane Battier Award for Sloan Conference/Stat Nerd Darling Du\u00a0Jour Bill: With apologies to Robert Covington\u2019s deflections, let\u2019s acknowledge the Crown Prince of the Moreyball Era, James Harden, for his third straight season of 200-plus made 3s and 700-plus made free throws. With four games to play, he\u2019s sitting at 244 made 3s and 713 made free throws, giving him an outside chance of creating the 250/750 club. But he\u2019s also sitting at 861 assists, opening the door for the 250/750/900 WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON Club. Jimmy Harden, everybody! 13. The Joel Embiid Award for Best Social Media\u00a0Persona Bill: Embiid didn\u2019t play enough games to win his own award, giving Chandler Parsons\u2019s Instagram account the nudge it needed. Hitting on Instagram models? Feuding with Joel Embiid? Dolphins? La familia? Chancun? Putting Chandler Parsons in Memphis was like putting Vincent Chase in Memphis\u200a\u2014\u200aonly if Vincent Chase was killing the Grizzlies\u2019 salary cap by more than 20 percent every season. The good news: Parsons still has enough in the tank to make Rob Hennigan\u2019s infamous whiteboard of hybrids! Sadly, Parsons took so much shit in Memphis for the Cancun Instagrams that he stopped posting. Or, Zach Randolph threatened to kill him. It\u2019s unclear. But we\u2019ll always have Chancun. 14. The Vin Baker Award for Riskiest Idea That Became an Unsurprising Failure Bill: (Search this piece for \u201cChancun.\u201d) Chris: So wait, the crippled core of a Chicago Bulls team that had been mortared, pestled, Vitamixed, and pulverized into a fine powder by Tom Thibodeau\u2019s DNP strategy didn\u2019t work out in New York? You\u2019re telling me Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose weren\u2019t able to Nicolas Cage the national treasure that is the triangle offense? And that\u2019s why Jeff Hornacek is the NBA coaching equivalent of the This Is Fine meme? Weird! 15. The Damon Jones Award for Best Bench\u00a0Chemist Bill: Alan Anderson\u2019s handshake routine on the (occasionally dysfunctional) Clippers bench has to be seen in person to be believed; it\u2019s like the Clips offered him a bonus for every game with at least 250 handshakes/hand slaps/fist bumps. Anderson doesn\u2019t listen to Doc Rivers in the timeout huddles; he\u2019s too busy grabbing prime real estate between the Clips bench and the scorer\u2019s table so he can dap everyone heading back on the court. If anyone tries to go around him, he chases them down from behind like J.J. Watt. YOU WILL SLAP MY HAND IN MULTIPLE STEPS! We need SportVU to keep track of hand taps; I think Anderson had the bench chemist version of Westbrook\u2019s triple-double season. Even Chris Paul seems to enjoy him, and Chris Paul hates everything and everyone. Alan Anderson is my favorite chemist since Walter White. Shea: Quincy Acy should win this award for every season that he\u2019s in the league, because nobody celebrates a good thing that\u2019s happened on the court from the bench like he does. He was on the Kings last year, and there was a play where DeMarcus Cousins dunked on Robin Lopez, and Quincy for real just jumped up off the bench with his hands in the air and ran down the sideline off camera. When DeMarcus dunked on Mason Plumlee two weeks later, Acy did the exact same celebration, and it was twice as funny the second time. The best one, though, was when Rajon Rondo dunked during a game and Acy, a darling, stood up and then fell backward pretending to faint from excitement. It was great, and probably the best dunk reaction of the last five years. Here\u2019s the thing of it, though, and I\u2019m telling you this because I\u2019m going to cheat a little: Quincy played for the Nets this season, and nothing good has happened to the Nets in at least 10 years, so there just hasn\u2019t been much for him to celebrate. Still, though, I think he gets here just off of pedigree. 16. The Jail Blazers Award for Best Ongoing Train\u00a0Wreck Bill: With apologies to Vlade & Vivek (the next great NBC comedy), Philly\u2019s medical staff (seriously, would you let them treat your sprained ankle?), the Brooklyn Nyets (no hope for the present or the future, but at least their owner has a good in with one of the co-presidents of the United States), and Phil/Melo/Dolan/Rose (I like Knicks fans, so that one just makes me sad), how can the Buss family NOT win this? You have, by all accounts, the greatest NBA owner of the last 35 years\u00a0\u2026 and somehow he spawned the most dysfunctional group of heirs that\u2019s ever owned an NBA team? The Buss siblings make the Maloofs look like the Emanuel brothers. Jeanie Buss seems like the most competent of the bunch; would you trust her to run a lemonade stand at this point? Since when did a bunch of related-by-blood NBA owners just start suing each other during a season? This was Game of Thrones after five drinks and a head injury. 17. The Hardwood Classics Award for Best Regular-Season Game Bill: With apologies to Christmas Day (Cavs 109, Warriors 108), Rockets-Warriors (132\u2013127 OT), Cavs-Wizards (LeBron\u2019s big 3) and both OKC-Boston games, I\u2019m picking the night that Zach Lowe and I finally fixed the septic tank on Waiters Island, reconnected the electricity and opened the island\u2019s airport back up for visitors: Miami\u2019s big win over Oakland! Waiters Island dropped 33 (including the game winner) that jump-started Miami\u2019s eventual 13-game winning streak (and the Spoelstrassaince). There might have been better Irrational Confidence Guys, just not lately. Come to Waiters Island, use your Amex points. Chris: This is recency bias at work, but Pacers-Cavs! Two overtimes, LeBron getting tested on every possession by Paul George (who also had the stones to guard Bron for most of the game), an intra-Cavs squabble live on TV\u00a0\u2026 \u2026 and the return of Lance Stephenson, the Great American LeBron Troll! What more do you want from a sporting event?! 18. The Skip Bayless Trophy for Best Straw Man Media\u00a0Argument Bill: I loved when advanced metrics showed Kawhi Leonard\u2019s defensive impact slipping a little, followed by some wondering if his defensive impact might be just a smidge overrated, then someone else doing research and realizing that Kawhi\u2019s opponents just randomly shot better than expected when he was out there, so actually, Kawhi Leonard WAS still great at defense. Or something. So\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t have to feel bad about believing that Kawhi is one of the best two perimeter defenders I\u2019ve ever seen in my life because his slightly-lower-than-usual defensive RPMs might be a little goofy this year? Thanks! Chris: I am Russell Westbrook\u2019s Kellyanne Conway, but even so, this is my reaction to people who say Russ stat-pads his rebounding numbers because nobody boxes him out: 19. The Vinnie Johnson Award for Best Heat Check\u00a0Guy Bill: I know Devin Booker dropped 70, and I know some other dudes (Klay, Dame, Isaiah, Waiters Island, etc.) can sprout those NBA Jam flames, but still, there\u2019s nothing more fun than when Steph gets hot. Sorry. Chris: Damian Lillard took a bit of a hit this year, enough that there was a semi-serious debate about whether the Blazers were better with C.J. McCollum at the controls. But Clutch Lillard is still one of the best reasons to watch the game. 20. The Virginia Beach Kings Award for Most Contrived Story on a Slow News\u00a0Day Bill: Kyrie Irving thinks the earth is flat? Can Becky Hammon be an NBA head coach? (Someone) is mad at (Charles Barkley or Shaquille O\u2019Neal)? Should NBA players rest during national TV games? Apologies to all of them: I vote for any story that glorifies triple-doubles like they\u2019re anything other than an arbitrary stat that we started to acknowledge 30\u201335 years ago because we were bored, then Ice Cube made it sound cool and now we\u2019re here. Chris: Kyrie Copernicus! This isn\u2019t even a conversation! 21. The Charles Oakley Award for the Teammate You\u2019d Want Getting Your Back in a Dark\u00a0Alley Bill: I would walk into any alley with Jusuf Nurkic. He\u2019s our best bet to pull a Willis Reed during an NBA game and punch out three opponents in 10 seconds. 22. The Nique Award for Best In-Game\u00a0Dunker Bill: You wouldn\u2019t put him in the Nique/Young MJ/Young Vince/Early Blake stratosphere, but Westbrook\u2019s occasional \u201cGrab the Rebound, Turn on the Jets, Slice Through Three Guys and Dunk on the Biggest One, Then Scowl at Everybody\u201d routine doubled as the most reliably exciting dunk-related League Pass moment. Honorable mention: Greek Freak on the break, Larry Nance Jr. in traffic, Jaylen Brown or Marquese Chriss in garbage time, the three times a year when Chris Paul dunks. Shea: A good Dominique Wilkins dunk had four parts. First, it was obviously a forceful, energetic, kinetic thing. Second, it had a great big spoonful of anger. Third, it was remarkably athletic. And fourth\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is maybe the most important part\u200a\u2014\u200ait had an echo. It lived on and rang out farther than Atlanta (or wherever the Hawks happened to playing the night when he dunked the flesh off someone\u2019s skeleton).
