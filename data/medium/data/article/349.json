{"name": "349", "parent": "", "content": "A Letter To My Grandfather, Whom I\u2019ll Never\u00a0Forget Just because you don\u2019t remember, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t\u00a0know Dear Grandpa, My name is Dan. I am your grandson. I\u2019m writing you from a plane on its way to San Francisco, where I live with a woman named Alex, whom you met a couple of days ago, inside the living room of the house you and Grandma now share in Holliston. You don\u2019t remember, but for much of my life, you were my best friend. In your living room, when you asked, that\u2019s what I told you: That my name is Dan, and that we used to be best friends. But it occurs to me now that you never called me Dan. You usually opted for Danny. Or Danny boy. Or\u200a\u2014\u200amore often\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201csoldier.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, soldier?\u201d you asked me one morning when I was about seven. We were crouched behind a log somewhere in the woods that flanked the house you and Grandma used to live in. My little brother, Scotty\u200a\u2014\u200ahere age five\u200a\u2014\u200astood up straight beside us, but still he shared our vantage. Scotty and I grew up in California, but my parents flew us out to visit you and Grandma every year. Whenever we did, any time not spent at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts or at Fenway Park was spent doing this: Trampling around the woods, pretending to kill Nazis. As usual, the smell of cigarette smoke hung on your breath. \u201cHow in the hell are we going to infiltrate this line?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, trying to convey how hard I was thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d Scotty said, a second later, trying to do the same. You pushed your big clear glasses a little higher on your nose, shifted in your crouch. It was autumn. The leaves crunching below our feet were the color of old pennies. \u201cLet me think,\u201d you said. Your tone was bristled yet restrained, burdened by the gravity of our situation: The Germans\u200a\u2014\u200aor so we\u2019d learned from base\u200a\u2014\u200awere camped out, unsuspecting but dangerous, a mere 50 yards ahead. I motioned to our left. \u201cHow about down through the creek.\u201d You followed my finger. Paused. \u201cYou wanna approach from the creek?\u201d you said after a moment, turning back to me, your eyes wide with shock. \u201cDanny, we know from base that there are Nazis hiding out all along that waterway.\u201d I considered this. I lifted a finger to my ear. \u201cWait. I just got word from base that the Germans are actually hiding in the trees to our right. If we approach from the creek, we can sneak up on them.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Scotty said again, suspicious this time. You shifted again in your crouch, readjusted your glasses, considered this new intelligence. ~ The Germans were a mere 50 yards ahead\u00a0~ \u201cHold on,\u201d you said, all jaw and determination. \u201cBetter get a word from the Captain on this.\u201d You stood up. Opened your hand, flattened your palm. You typed something and then lifted your hand to your ear. Your eyes turned stern and resolute as you waited. A patter of auburn trickled through the branches, speckling your face. \u201cCap, this is Lieutenant Colonel Hansen, my First Lieutenant here says he has knowledge that the Germans have relocated from the creek to the woods. Is that correct?\u201d You waited, nodded, cursed under your breath. \u201cHow in the hell did they know we were comin\u2019?\u201d You waited again. \u201cNo, I\u2019d like to know how they got that intel is what I\u2019d like to know, Captain.\u201d You smirked and gave me and Scotty a little wink. So you wouldn\u2019t see me smile, I looked down and tightened the sweatshirt tied around my waist. \u201cAlright, Captain,\u201d you said after a beat. \u201cOver and out.\u201d You slipped your hand back into your pocket. \u201cYou were right, Danny. The sons of bitches knew we were comin\u2019.\u201d \u201cThose sons of bitches,\u201d Scotty said. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d I asked. You kneeled back down to share my perspective, gathered your thoughts in the trees in the distance. After a second you turned back to me, eyeing me with a new kind of excitement, a spark of anticipation. \u201cSee that tree about 20 feet to our left?\u201d I nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou lead the way. I\u2019ll cover you.\u201d Then you sprang to your feet, shuffle-stepped behind a bush on the left-hand side of the trail, lifted the plastic toy gun in your hand, and whisper-yelled, \u201cGo go go!\u201d I took off. Uninstructed, Scotty immediately did the same, bellowing arrrhhhh with his face flexed in fury and his toy gun raised high the whole way. After the mission, we sat on a log overlooking the creek bed. Silence. The smell of earth. A ribbon of smoke danced skyward from your cigarette. \u201cGood work today, soldier,\u201d you said to me. \u201cThank God you got that intel.\u201d When your cigarette was finished, we walked home. About nine years later, as you were walking to work, you slipped on some ice and hit your head on the sidewalk. A subsequent trip to the hospital revealed brain damage, and resulted in a diagnosis of vascular dementia, which is irreversible, and for which there is no cure. Over the next few years, your mind would be stolen from you, and as a result you would forget about me, about Scotty, and about all the imaginary worlds we created together in the woods. My Grandpa It\u2019s probably no surprise that, for a long time after you were diagnosed, thinking of you and your illness filled me with sadness, and also a bit of cynicism. I remember one year we came out to visit a few years after you fell. You and I were sitting on the porch of a new, slightly smaller house. We\u2019d been talking baseball, trading platitudes about players you still remembered, like Ted Williams, but inevitably the conversation waned, and eventually we resigned to silence. It was winter, and a white film of snow blanketed the lawn. I remember missing you so badly, right then. I felt as if I were saying goodbye to you, like you were drifting away from me slowly yet unstoppably, a boat untethered from a dock. But I also remember the way your eyes looked, as we sat and you stared into the frozen grass\u200a\u2014\u200afragile and tenuous, little pools of light blue. I thought I could see fear in them, in the way they shimmered, wet and pearlescent. I could see the muscles in your jaw\u200a\u2014\u200aclenching, straining, like gears of a machine at work against some impending menace. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen you afraid. For so long, I\u2019d imagined you as infallible, as fundamental, impervious somehow to the appetite of time. It was shocking, realizing that you were not\u200a\u2014\u200arealizing that, no matter what, nature is cruel, and time eats everything. And so for a long time, in addition to sadness, when I thought of you, I thought of this\u200a\u2014\u200acruelty, death, inevitability. And I hated it\u200a\u2014\u200aboth that you were being taken from me, as well as the fact that, as your degeneration made so unavoidably clear, the nature of the world we live in is in no way governed by anything as neat or as just or as sensible as karma. I hated it, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Each time I saw you, every time I thought of you, even, I was reminded of what I was losing. At some point, though\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe once I got to college, or once I started teaching, or after I met Alex\u200a\u2014\u200aI realized how stupid this was of me, not to mention selfish, succumbing to such solipsistic and self-piteous inclinations. It fills me with guilt, now, thinking about how focused on myself I was. Every time I saw you or spoke with you or even thought of you, after your diagnosis, I should have striven to be brave, and empathetic, and conscious of what aspects of my life and the relationships I keep are actually in my control. Around the same time, I realized that, even though you had been taken from me, the worlds you and I created\u200a\u2014\u200athe worlds you gave me\u200a\u2014\u200athose had not been taken. On the contrary, they were still around, and I in fact still had them. Whenever I wanted to, I could pull them out and hold them in my palm, like little blue marbles to be kept in my pocket, the same color as your eyes. I want you to know, Grandpa, just how grateful I am to have those. I want you to know how much I appreciate the fact that, growing up, you treated me like a real person. That you treated me like an equal, like a friend, like someone who mattered, as opposed to just a kid, some kind of subordinate. I want you to know how much I treasured the fact that you considered my contributions to our war games valuable. I will never forget that day you told me: \u201cThank God you got that intel.\u201d Of course I told you all this last week, when Alex and Grandma and Auntie Rhonda and I were sitting around your coffee table in Holliston, after I introduced you to Alex (and after you told her she was beautiful). I told you again before we left, too, pausing for a second by your chair and looking you once again in your still-pearlescent eyes. I told you just as I should have been telling you all along, every chance I got. I appreciated that opportunity. But now that I\u2019ve left you\u200a\u2014\u200anow that I\u2019m gone and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to see you again\u200a\u2014\u200asimply having told you all that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. I want you to know how important of a person you were to me the same way that I know. I want you to know how much I loved being with you. It\u2019s my belief that, just because you don\u2019t remember, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t know. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing you now. I want to give you something that\u2019s tangible. That you can hold on to. My hope is that, from time to time, you can pick up this letter and read it with Grandma, and remind yourself that you were\u200a\u2014\u200afor one boy, at the very least\u200a\u2014\u200athe most important thing in the world. That you were a source of happiness and pride and confidence and joy, that you were the best grandfather any boy could ever have, and that somewhere, wherever that boy has gone to next, he still loves you, more than he can really describe, and he will not, until the day he dies, forget about you, nor the memories you created for him\u200a\u2014\u200amemories he keeps in his pocket, everywhere he goes. Thank you again, Grandpa, for everything. Know how loved you are. Always, Your soldier I sent this to my Grandpa earlier today. I posted it here because I thought others who\u2019ve gone through something similar might relate. If this resonated with you, please click the heart so more people can see it.
