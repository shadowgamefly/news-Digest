{"name": "1176", "parent": "", "content": "The 3 Most Important Questions You Can Ask When\u00a0Hiring You want to smartly and quickly add great employees who will help your business thrive and grow. After all, recruiting and hiring people isn\u2019t cheap. It takes time and money to advertise the open position, interview candidates, and train your new hires. Despite all your best efforts to screen out the slackers or potentially toxic employees, it\u2019s pretty much inevitable that you\u2019ll hire the wrong person (or many such persons) at some point. Want to stop hiring losers? Wouldn\u2019t you rather hire employees who are likely to become superstars at your company? I\u2019ve got the solution for you. You shouldn\u2019t hire someone just because they check off a certain number of boxes: Are You Asking Situational Questions? I\u2019m not involved much with hiring these days (because my company has grown so big). However, in the early days of my company, I was very much hands on during the hiring process. Many of the people I hired went on to become superstar performers who helped my company get to where it is today (and many of them are still there), while others have moved on to create businesses of their own or do other amazing things. What was my secret for hiring the best people? Asking them the RIGHT questions. It\u2019s not about asking crazy interview questions like \u201cwould you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses\u201d or \u201cif you were a pizza delivery man, how would you benefit from scissors?\u201d Instead of wasting everyone\u2019s time, try asking these three situational questions. These interview questions will help you figure out whether the person you\u2019re interviewing is truly a unicorn\u200a\u2014\u200aor just a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face. 1. Tell Me About Your Best Achievement and Why It Was so\u00a0Great In an interview, I force applicants to focus on what they have done rather than how they describe themselves. For the remainder of this article, let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m trying to hire for a content marketing position. Instead of asking about their education or some award they won, I will ask something like: \u201cTell me about your best content marketing campaign of all time and what was so great about it?\u201d How the person answers this question will give me a ton of insight about their ability to measure and analyze results, how they define success, their creative process, and much more. 2. How Do You Decide What to do\u00a0Next? Another critical interview question to ask of your potential new hires is how they manage workflow after completing a task. So during the interview I might ask an applicant: \u201cYou\u2019ve just successfully completed writing an article. How do you decide what to do next?\u201d Continuing our hiring example, one obvious answer to the question is to start working on a new piece of content. But what I really want to know is how they research topics. What\u2019s their process? How do they pick where to focus? How they answer this question will reveal a lot about your potential new employee\u2019s thought process. Knowing how your employee thinks is incredibly valuable. 3. How Do You Know What You Did Paid\u00a0Off? Want to find out what metrics your potential new employee values? In marketing, it\u2019s all about the almighty return on investment (ROI). But everyone has their own definition of ROI. So I ask potential hires: How do you know if that content campaign if your hard work paid off or not. What analytics to they care about? Is it just pageviews? Or are they thinking more deeply about What are the analytics behind PVs that they\u2019re thinking about. Bonus Question: Will You Complete This\u00a0Project? Want to make extra sure you\u2019re hiring the best person for the job? Ask them to create something. Continuing our example, I might ask, \u201cCan you write me a listicle?\u201d It\u2019s really hard to get a sense for someone\u2019s writing abilities from an interview. If they really want the job and have the necessary skills (but perhaps they don\u2019t have a large body of published work), then they should have no trouble completing such a basic assignment. In fact, in some instances, it might make more sense for you to bypass the interview completely and start here. Yes, many applicants will scoff at giving away their talents for free. Consider offering to pay them a little something for their time and effort to create the sample. It\u2019s better to spend a few bucks now to find out rather than putting them on the payroll before you find out the truth. If what they turn in is great, then great! If not, then move on. Conclusion It can be really tough to figure out from a 30-minute interview whether you\u2019ve just interviewed someone who is truly excellent, or who is just a charming liar. These three questions will act as your personal unicorn detector, to help you separate the great people from the average during the interview process. All you have to do is adapt these three questions for your particular industry or a specific role: \u00b7 \u201cTell me about your best [job specific accomplishment] of all time and what was so great about it?\u201d \u00b7 \u201cAfter completing a task/project, how do you decide what to do next?\u201d \u00b7 \u201cHow do you know what you did paid off?\u201d Asking these questions will help you consistently start hiring the best people for the position\u200a\u2014\u200athe unicorns!
