{"name": "1211", "parent": "", "content": "The Girl Who Never\u00a0Smiles Look who\u2019s smiling\u00a0now. I Woke up chugging pain this morning, My breaths went Fast, My heart went slow. My mind was gripped with fear and despair, It was plastered all over my face, It clung to my clothes like Concrete on the road. I ran into you today, You told me I was too dark to function You hurled your insults at me, Blow after blow. The girl who never smiles, The girl who never laughs, The girl no one talks to, She\u2019s the epitome of alone. The quiet one, The silent one, Too silent for words, Too silent to know. But there\u2019s one thing That you Couldn\u2019t, Wouldn\u2019t, Didn\u2019t dare to know. That girl fights back, Her teeth bite Hard, She\u2019s not afraid of you anymore. My eyes reeked of depression, But I still saw the lies in your truth I saw the fake shine you sported, I saw the insecurities you brewed. You don\u2019t like different, do you? I scare you, don\u2019t I? With the fucks I don\u2019t give And the confidence I ooze. Thought you could taunt me perhaps, Haunt me maybe, But break me? Hell no. Thought you could make me doubt I was special, Doubt I was worthy, Doubt I was true. But the truth is one, And the truth is this: The victim is You.
