{"name": "288", "parent": "", "content": "How to be a good writer with a good\u00a0life The WRITER Framework I have a thing about teeny, tiny goals. They\u2019ve changed my life, more than once. For the last couple of months, I\u2019ve been kicking around the idea of stacking teeny, tiny goals. I can (obviously) fit six in an hour. So, I started thinking about the things that might help me to become a more well-rounded writer and generally happy human being. Writing and reading, of course. But also physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Here\u2019s what I came up with: The WRITER Framework. WRITER stands for Writing, Reading, Ideation, Talking, Exercising, and Regrouping. Everyday, for at least ten minutes a day, I do these\u00a0things. I write fiction. I read fiction. I make a list of ten ideas. (Thanks James Altucher!) I talk to someone I don\u2019t live with. I exercise. I review my day and plan for tomorrow. The first two are all about being a writer. They\u2019re the building blocks of your craft and if you do them everyday, even for a few minutes, you won\u2019t be able to help improving. The rest about the good life part of the equation. The secret\u00a0sauce. The best thing about teeny, tiny goals is that they\u2019re so small\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s easier to just do them than it is to skip them. Psychologically. An hour long goal? Not so much. You can skip an hour. No problem. So, the key is to keep the goals separate in your head. That way, if you skip your walk, or have a recluse day, you might not skip everything else. Also, for everything on this list, ten minutes is a guilt-free minimum. Hit ten minutes and you can stop. You\u2019re a rock star! You\u2019ve hit your goal. Give yourself a gold star. (I mean it. Get a calendar and some star stickers. Do it up.) But, I can almost guarantee that one day you\u2019ll find yourself writing for an hour or you\u2019ll take a nice long walk or fall into a great conversation with someone. I followed the Framework everyday for a month. Here\u2019s what happened. I wrote nearly 19,000 words toward my new\u00a0novel. Incidentally, I also wrote on Medium every day. I clearly write more than ten minutes a day. What this little goal does for me is simple. It keeps me writing every single days. There was at least one day a week over the last month where I would have just skipped writing. But, because I had this goal, I didn\u2019t. Which is good, because I know from long experience that skipping one day leads so easily into skipping two. I read eleven\u00a0books. I\u2019m in an MFA program and I have to read a lot. Ten books a month. Plus, I read a poem, an essay, and a short story every day for the 1000 Day MFA program I run through Ninja Writers. So, the ten minutes a day? That represents the extra book. I read that one just for pure pleasure. In ten minutes a day. It was Blackbirds by Chuck Wendig. I had 300 ideas! A couple of them were even\u00a0good. I came up with ideas for friends. Ideas for silly apps I\u2019d love to have. Books I want to write. Fairy tale tropes. Ideas for a new newsletter. Ten people I want to meet and how I can do that. One of them was James Altucher, who writes a lot about the power of writing down ten ideas a day. I asked him if he minded if I included it as the I in WRITER. He didn\u2019t. (This counts for T, too!) I reached out to people and some of them reached back. That was huge\u00a0fun. Besides James, I also had coffee with Jonas Ellison. And lunch with my friend Tracy. I talked to the lady who works at the fabric counter at Wal-mart about her grandchildren. I called my sister. I talked a couple of times to my friend Amy. I talked to my ex-husband\u2019s sister, who is also called Amy. I spoke to the other soccer moms, instead of sitting by myself feeling awkward. I lost seven\u00a0pounds. This is about 100 percent because exercising everyday made me more mindful of what I was eating. I started a new note keeping system and set up a writing accountability tool that I\u00a0love. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve never heard of a Commonplace Book before. This feels like a pivotal moment. Before and after my Commonplace Book. I wrote an ebook about this\u00a0thing. It\u2019s the reward for patrons at the $3 level and above on the Ninja Writer Patreon account. It goes into much greater detail about each aspect of the WRITER framework and there are a couple of printables, too. You can get it here. The past $3 awards were The Writing Planner, The Plotting Workshop eBook, and an eBook called 31 Days of Ninja Writing. You\u2019ll get all of those, too.
