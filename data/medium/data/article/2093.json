The moment when you realize that you are finally slipping into the \u201cmature\u201d category. The moment when millennials show off all the reasons why they were born at the right time. The moment your dream comes true and then evolves into a nightmare because of bad timing. I quit my job because I\u2019m too old for it. It took me 15 years to get the offer. Back then, I was a young celebrity-obsessed wanna be (something) who spent summer nights drenched in anything and everything E! had to offer. I watched every award show that was televised and voraciously devoured the glossies with the hopes that my name would one day appear in the masthead. Those days were hopeful, but they now belong to the girl that I remember fondly but don\u2019t quite connect with anymore. The girl today, is now much older and isn\u2019t nearly as carefree and absorbent as she once was. The things that made her pulse race\u200a\u2014\u200aare no longer able to surmount that level of excitement. In her youth, she embodied a time when expression of any kind didn\u2019t require multiple levels of validation through the sounds of clicks and the sight of numbers glowing with recognition. She understood the value of the written word and that\u2019s how she was raised and taught, but she didn\u2019t garner the advantage of being shown how to sell those words effectively\u200a\u2014\u200athrough carefully manipulated jargon that can be constantly rearranged and besotted with symbols\u200a\u2014\u200athat are supposed to label your output as worthy. Of a click. Clicks and stones that formed in my abdomen as I clicked with all my might through the hours of the night and recycled drippings from the machine of aggregated output\u200a\u2014\u200aforced me to visualize how my younger self would receive this excruciating exercise. She would fit right in. She would enjoy the \u201cgrabs\u201d and \u201cpick-ups,\u201d and she would be one of the boldest in the newsroom with her suggestions on how to make the scandalous homepage more enticing without skipping a beat. She would be able to tolerate the shitty hours and the social flow of flows without missing a beat. That beat. That beat passed me\u00a0by. Surrounded by millennials typing away mercilessly as they produce and schedule their breaking stories\u200a\u2014\u200aI am acutely aware that I\u2019m comically out of place. I don\u2019t give a damn about anything that is happening around me and I am too exhausted to pretend that I do. They are doing exactly what I wish I had been doing back in 1998\u200a\u2014\u200awhen I was sending query letters to Honey Magazine, Jane Magazine and the rest of the brood that ruled the scene. As the rejection pile grew and the \u201cno responses\u201d cut deep\u200a\u2014\u200aI knew that my inability to do what I wanted to do when it mattered most would lead to where I am now. Lost, confused, slightly bitter, envious, embarrassingly overwhelmed, and angry that I am paying a high price for being at the right place at the wrong time. Or maybe it\u2019s the wrong place at the right time. Or maybe I just can\u2019t figure out why I am always constipated and sleepy. So, I quit. I\u2019m not quitting the person I am\u200a\u2014\u200aI like her just fine. I\u2019m just quitting the quest to resurrect her torment in order to fulfill the dream that died without a proper burial. I am at peace. And so is she.
