Not because we get to see the 26-time German champions Bayern Munich take on defending Champions League winners Real Madrid. And not because we get to see arguably the best attack in the world, Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez, and Neymar, square off against the best defense in Juventus\u2019s shape-shifting back line. No, it\u2019s due to Borussia Dortmund and Monaco: a pairing that\u2019s sure to have less talent than those other two\u200a\u2014\u200asorry, Leicester City and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u200a\u2014\u200abut is guaranteed to produce high-scoring excitement. Here are four reasons why. 1. Goals, Goals, Goals,\u00a0Etc. Monaco have a goal difference of plus-62 in Ligue 1 this season. Chelsea, the soon-to-be Premier League winners, have scored 65. Leonardo Jardim\u2019s team has been incredibly potent this year, with a direct attack that moves at an electric pace. The two strikers, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Radamel Falcao, are never in short supply of chances, as the system focuses on getting the ball to them as often as possible\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in spaces behind the opposition defense. Granted, they have been quite lucky, with the forwards converting shots at an unprecedented clip of over 33 percent more chances than expected goals suggest, but nothing about Dortmund says they\u2019ll be able to cool off Monaco\u2019s hot streak. Barcelona\u2019s Best Midfielder Plays for Bayern MunichEducated in Spain and brought to Germany by Pep Guardiola, Thiago is finally healthy\u200a\u2014\u200aand he\u2019s doing it alltheringer.com The German defense is inconsistent at best. They shut down Bayern Munich before the winter break as well as RB Leipzig just after. But recently, their off days come more frequently, as evidenced by this past Saturday\u2019s 4\u20131 loss to Bayern. With the rate at which Monaco supply their strikers, the Dortmunder back line will be constantly tested and likely forced into mistakes. But it\u2019s not like Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side won\u2019t punch back; per expected goals, their attack has actually been better than Monaco\u2019s this season. 2. See All the Next Big\u00a0Things A lot has been made about both Mbapp\u00e9 and Christian Pulisic recently, and for good reason. The former has exploded onto the scene with six goals in Monaco\u2019s four games in March, while Pulisic is only 18, yet might already be America\u2019s best player\u00a0\u2026 ever? The Best American Soccer Player Is an 18-Year-Old From Hershey, PennsylvaniaAt this point, the only thing crazier than betting on Christian Pulisic is betting against himtheringer.com They\u2019re not the only two talented kids who will take to the pitch Tuesday. Pulisic\u2019s fellow winger, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, is perhaps the most exciting 19-year-old in the world right now. He lacks consistency and his decision-making can leave a lot to be desired, but the pure speed of his dribbling has made a mockery of many Bundesliga defenders in his first full professional season. He\u2019s a direct player who will run at his man wherever he is on the pitch and uses his capacity to change direction at high speeds to devastating effect. As the season has progressed, Tuchel has brought the winger into a more central role, where he has threatened with direct runs through gaps in midfield. Central midfielders, who are more accustomed to cutting out stray passes, simply don\u2019t know how to deal with the forward running at them in full pace. Despite losing on aggregate, Manchester City showed how to create these gaps between Monaco\u2019s two midfielders, and Tuchel may do the same. In Dortmund\u2019s way, though, will be Monaco\u2019s oldest first-choice midfielder: the 23-year-old Fabinho. The Brazilian is well-rounded, and spent most of his career as an attacking right-back, before he was moved into a central position toward the end of last season. Much like Nemanja Matic and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 of Chelsea, Fabinho\u2019s flexibility is what allows Monaco to play with just two in the middle. Nemanja Matic and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 Are the Best Midfield Trio in the Premier LeagueIn Chelsea\u2019s midfield, one plus one equals threetheringer.com At 6-foot-2, his enormous stride allows him to cover a great amount of space in defense, which means that the two attacking midfielders, Bernardo Silva (22 years old) and Thomas Lemar (21), can focus on what they do best. In the most lethal attack in Europe, Silva is the best attacker. He\u2019s an excellent dribbler who can make incisive passes from in front of the opposition defensive line. He often attacks diagonally from the wing, cutting in behind the midfield line, looking to find the two strikers running behind the opposing center backs. Tasked with slowing down Silva will be Dortmund\u2019s midfield pivot Julian Weigl, another crucial young player for Tuchel\u2019s side at just 21. Key in helping his team bring the ball out of their own third, he maintains balance within the attack through incisive passes to break the midfield line and an intelligent positional game that links teammates. However, Monaco\u2019s narrow press will pose a difficult challenge to the pivot\u2019s influence. With a 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 shape, Silva and Thomas Lemar stay close to their strikers and central midfielders, rather than pushing to the touchline, making it easier for Monaco to cover the middle of the pitch. Both Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig used this shape in their wins over Dortmund in the first half of the season. Their high presses, which emphasised blocking any passes into Weigl, were a deciding factor in shutting down the attack before it ever got started. 3. Who Doesn\u2019t Love a Good Counterattack? Another of Dortmund\u2019s frailties is their transition into defense after losing the ball. Unfortunately for them, attacking these moments is Monaco\u2019s specialty. The side possesses pace in every position, and this comes to life when their opponent loses the ball with open spaces higher upfield. When this speed is housed by well-coordinated movements from the front four, they can cut up any team. Pep Guardiola and Manchester City learned this the hard way in the round of 16. They frequently struggled to break out of Monaco\u2019s press, and if they did, there was always a chance that Mbapp\u00e9 and others would break into space left behind. Much like Manchester City, Dortmund\u2019s expansive attacking play can leave them vulnerable. If their counterpress doesn\u2019t quickly win the ball back, then the remainder of the defense can be left isolated with the midfield high up the pitch. Tuchel has taken steps toward remedying this, such as changing from a four-man defense to a three-back, but he hasn\u2019t completely solved the problem. 4. They Make Wingers Cool\u00a0Again With both teams possessing a raft of exciting wide forwards, the touchlines will host most of the attacking play\u200a\u2014\u200aa tactical trend of the past few years in response to the narrow, packed-in defenses employed by the likes of Atletico and Leicester. For Monaco, the two attacking midfielders will tuck inside into the half-spaces between the center and flank, providing more room for attacking fullbacks Benjamin Mendy and Almamy Tour\u00e9. From the left, Mendy specializes in low, fast-paced crosses as well as cutbacks. Instead of constantly lofting the ball into the air, these crosses arrive at the feet of Falcao and Co., allowing for much easier finishes. On the right, Tour\u00e9 doesn\u2019t possess the offensive talents of Mendy, so the ball instead finds the feet of the attacking midfielder, Silva, more often. With his direct runs and through-ball-passing, the team attacks diagonally toward goal from that side. Radamel Falcao and the Power of the French Soccer SpaHaving trouble coping in England or Spain? Try France\u2019s Ligue 1.theringer.com Since losing midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan to Manchester United and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan to Manchester City over the summer, Borussia Dortmund have adapted to their personnel and looked more to the wings to provide their attacking impetus. With the likes of Pulisic, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and Turkish Emre Mor, also 19, as replacements, the focus has shifted from combinations in tight spaces to isolations closer to the touchline. The oft-injured-but-\u00fcber-talented winger Marco Reus, a rare veteran in Dortmund\u2019s attack, returned to training Monday and could also make a comeback for the tie. On Tuesday, the game between Barcelona and Juventus may as well be the final, and the winner of that tie will likely enter the semifinals as one of the favorites. Bar\u00e7a-Juve will be a snapshot of what world-class football looks like right now.
