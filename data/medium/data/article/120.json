Add a question\u00a0mark. Last week, my team at Google announced that we\u2019d be hosting all of Stack Overflow\u2019s Q&A data on BigQuery. Here are some of the most interesting insights about Stack Overflow that we\u2019ve uncovered so far. Setting up the data\u00a0dump Nick Craver at Stack Overflow announced a new dataset dump on Friday: We quickly loaded the full data dump into BigQuery: Stack Overflow in BigQuery updated to 2016\u201312\u201311 If you want an answer, use a question\u00a0mark Sara Robinson discovered that only 22% of Stack Overflow questions end with a question mark. So I thought\u200a\u2014\u200ahm\u2026 that\u2019s interesting. But does adding a \u201c?\u201d actually help you get answers? So I did an analysis of how many questions got an \u201caccepted answer.\u201d I then grouped them by whether or not they ended with a question mark. It turns out that in 2016, 78% of questions ending in \u201c?\u201d got an accepted answer versus only only 73% of questions that didn\u2019t end in \u201c?\u201d. And this pattern remains consistent if you look back through the years. So if you want people to actually answer your Stack Overflow questions, end them with a question mark. What about the number of answers a given question gets? Do questions that end with a \u201c?\u201d get more replies? Yes, they do: Using a question mark in 2015 and 2016 gave questions at least 7% more answers. This is even more noticeable in 2008 and 2009, during which questions with a \u201c?\u201d have received 23% more answers than questions without one.
