He flung his school bag on the floor, pulled off his shoes and ran to the kitchen. \u201cMommy!\u201d he called. \u201cMommy, where are you?\u201d \u201cUpstairs,\u201d came his mother\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cMommy, come down,\u201d Jimmy cried. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d As he waited for his mother in the kitchen, Jimmy did an excited little hop and a skip and then a little pirouette. Then he went to the front door where he had flung down his bag and brought it into the kitchen. When his mother came downstairs, she saw Jimmy poring over a piece of paper, tongue sticking out, brow furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you have there, Jimmy?\u201d his mother asked. \u201cMommy,\u201d Jimmy jumped up to show her. \u201cWe are going to see a play. My teacher said so. It\u2019s called \u2018Goldilocks and the Three Bears\u2019. Can I go?\u201d Mommy took the piece of paper from Jimmy\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to sign it and send it back to school along with $20. Can I go Mommy?\u201d Mommy scanned the piece of paper and then turned to Jimmy. \u201cI dunno, Jim. That\u2019s pretty expensive for a play for kindergarten.\u201d \u201cMommy, please,\u201d Jimmy said, tears welling up in his eyes. \u201cEveryone is going. Tom and Simon and Mick and\u2026.\u201d \u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Mom said. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at this form and see.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t say no,\u201d Jimmy whispered under his breath as his mom left the room. It was decided that evening that Jimmy would go. Mommy sent the money to his teacher at school the next day. Jimmy could not contain his excitement. It was the first time he was going on a school excursion. He could not wait. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t time pass?\u201d he grumbled to himself as he sat in the kitchen that evening. \u201cWhen will it be April 27th? How many days left, Mommy?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still two weeks away,\u201d his mother laughed. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d Jimmy said glumly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we can do,\u201d said Mommy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we cross off days on the calendar till we reach April 27th?\u201d \u201cCross off days on the calendar?\u201d Jimmy said, his eyes big. \u201cWell, when people are waiting for a special day, they mark days off on a calendar. That way they can keep track off the number of days left.\u201d \u201cI want to do that, Mommy,\u201d Jimmy said, jumping up. \u201cOkay, well, here\u2019s the calendar,\u201d Mommy took down the calendar hanging on the kitchen wall. It was a nice, colourful one with different animals for every month. January had had a small, fuzzy kitten wearing a winter cap. February had had a big, bouncy dog playing with a ball. March had had a small golden retriever looking out the window at the rain. And now April had some rabbits munching on lettuce leaves in a green field. Oh, it was a very pretty calendar. \u201cNow, lets see,\u201d said Mommy. \u201cToday is April 12th. We have to reach April 27th. So tonight, just before you go to bed, you can make a big cross on April 12th. That means today is finished and then you can count the number of days that are left.\u201d Jimmy pranced around the kitchen in his excitement. \u201cCan I do it right now, Mommy? Can I? Can I?\u201d \u201cYou have to wait till bed-time,\u201d said Mommy, ruffling his hair as he bounced by her. That night Jimmy climbed up on the kitchen counter in his pyjamas. His mother let him take down the calendar himself. He counted up to the twelfth day and then, with his tongue sticking out, he made a big red cross over the number. He looked up at his mother proudly. \u201cCount till the 27th,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how many days are left.\u201d Jimmy counted. \u201cFourteen days, mom.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll cross another day off tomorrow.\u201d Soon there were only seven days left. Jimmy meticulously and diligently crossed out a day every night before he went to bed. Daddy laughed at how earnest he looked when he did it. Mommy counted the number of days left with him. Soon there was one day left. The play was tomorrow. Jimmy was very excited, it was all he could think about. On the morning of the play, Jimmy woke up with a scratchy throat and a high fever. He bravely got out of bed and dragged himself down to the kitchen calendar. He confirmed that today was the day and turned to his mother. \u201cMommy,\u201d he said in a raspy voice. \u201cToday\u2019s the play.\u201d Mommy took one look at him and whipped out her thermometer. She checked his temperature; pretty high. She looked at his hot little face and bloodshot eyes and ordered him back to bed. \u201cBut Mommy,\u201d cried Jimmy. \u201cIt\u2019s the day of the play. The calendar says so.\u201d \u201cOff to bed,\u201d ordered Mommy. \u201cI\u2019ll be by with a cold compress.\u201d Jimmy couldn\u2019t stand it. He dragged his feet back to bed with a broken heart and a choked up throat. How horribly unfair! He stayed in bed, crying and being miserable. Mommy brought him some hot soup and the tablet to play with. But it was pointless. Nothing would console him. He had waited too hard and for too long. The disappointment was unbearable. Mommy and Daddy were both upset for him. He had crossed out the days so diligently and waited so patiently. It really wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cJimmy,\u201d Mommy said to him, when he woke up after his nap. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you couldn\u2019t go see the play. I know how much you wanted to go.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Mommy,\u201d said Jimmy, bravely. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault really. I just got sick.\u201d His voice sort of broke at the end of the sentence but he didn\u2019t cry. \u201cYou are a good boy,\u201d said Mommy, kissing his feverish forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise.\u201d The next week, Daddy came home with a sealed envelope. He handed it to Jimmy and looked very mysterious. When Jimmy opened it, three tickets to Goldilocks and the Three Bears fell out. \u201cAnd the best part is, you won\u2019t have to cross any days off of the calendar, Jimmy,\u201d said Daddy. \u201cBecause it\u2019s tonight.\u201d Jimmy stared at his father in glee. \u201cI know you wanted to go with your friends,\u201d said Daddy. \u201cBut that couldn\u2019t be helped. You can go with Mummy and me and I\u2019m sure you'll have as great a time as you would with your friends.\u201d Jimmy stared at his parents adoringly. \u201cI\u2019ll probably have a better time with you guys anyway,\u201d he mumbled. And then he did a little hop around the living room, the tickets in his hand.
