{"name": "1676", "parent": "", "content": "The Deep Learning\u00a0Roadmap It just occurred to me, that after a couple of years tracking Deep Learning developments, that nobody has even bothered to create a map of what\u2019s going on! So I quickly decided to come up with a Deep Learning roadmap. A word of warning, this is just a partial map and doesn\u2019t cover the latest developments. Many of the ideas I write on this blog isn\u2019t even covered by this map. Anyway, here\u2019s a start of this and hope people start coming out of their labs to further expand on it. The \u201cUnsupervised Learning\u201d part is from a talk by Russ Salakhutdinov and the \u201cReinforcement Learning\u201d part is from a talk by Pieter Abbeel. There are a ton of other ideas that are coming out of the edges as well as the center of this diagram. Also, I did not show the connections between the 3 center concepts. For example, you can use CNNs for Value Iteration and GAN and VAEs use DL networks. It\u2019s a wild world in the Deep Learning space and you just never know how all of this gets re-arrange. I\u2019ve got a higher level map that starts off with this: that possibly can stitch everything together in one \u201cgrand unified theory\u201d. This is how I think it will all play out: Unsupervised learning is the the \u2018dark matter\u2019 where we need a lot more clarity. It\u2019s my conjecture that meta-learning (with context) is the approach to this. There is some evidence that is developing, but I cannot know for sure. Modular Deep Learning is already in the cards. There is sufficient evidence that this works well. Market Driven Coordination is still early stages, but I believe that the only real way forward is to have diverse architectures working on the same problem and \u201cmarkets\u201d are a known decentralized way to coordinate actions. There\u2019s still a lot to be done though and we just in the early stages of Deep Learning evolution: see: https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/five-levels-of-capability-of-deep-learning-ai-4ac1d4a9f2be One additional key issue outside of unsupervised learning is the need to bridge the semantic gap between connectionist and symbolic architectures. If you think there\u2019s a demand for more clarity in Deep Learning, then support this kind of effort by buying the \u201cDeep Learning Playbook\u201d.
