Last week on The Tonight Show, Atlanta rap trio Migos performed their new hit single \u201cT-Shirt\u201d in pastel-colored faux-fur coats. In their latest music video, which has garnered nearly 70 million plays in two months, the rappers don more traditional fur outerwear in a Revenant-like setting. Men who dare to wear fur coats have never been more in vogue; men wearing animal hair have become as common as girls in flower crowns at music festivals. Despite PETA\u2019s best efforts, the allure of fur\u200a\u2014\u200awhich saw its heyday in the 1950s\u200a\u2014\u200apersists. In 2016, an estimated 63 percent of the major designers showing in London, Milan and Paris used fur in some form, according to the International Fur Federation. But to fully understand this fur-coat renaissance\u200a\u2014\u200ain which rappers and pop idols like Justin Bieber, Macklemore, 50 Cent and Cam\u2019ron have all covered themselves with animal hides as a symbol of their status\u2014it helps to close your eyes and imagine what it would be like if you suddenly fell into a swimming pool of hundred-dollar bills. Because the common thread among fur\u2019s biggest fans is having had no money\u2014and now having so much that wiping your ass with hundies is entirely possible. If bespoke suits, ascots and Barbour hunting jackets represent old-money lineage, the fur coat is the ultimate symbol of the nouveau riche\u2014those who acquired wealth within their own lifetime rather than by familial inheritance. Those of us who don\u2019t have one\u200a\u2014\u200amainly because we can\u2019t afford one\u200a\u2014\u200aare on the outside, freezing our asses off, looking in. Take UFC superstar Conor McGregor, whose net worth reached $22.5 million in just the last few years. On the eve of his biggest fight to date, with fellow lightweight Eddie Alvarez, Connor showed up to the pre-fight press conference with a shit-eating grin and a white Gucci mink coat\u200a\u2014\u200aan homage to legendary boxer Joe Frazier, who wore the same outfit nearly 43 years earlier. The look was ridiculous, but that was the point. It was a showcase of all that he\u2019s worked for\u2014in McGregor\u2019s case, literally fought for. \u201cI think people are intrigued and grossed out at the same time,\u201d says Macklemore in a video in which he displays his fur collection. It\u2019s no coincidence that he went from doing drugs and living in his mom\u2019s basement to winning the 2015 Grammy for best album. Of course, rich men having been wearing fur for years. In the \u201890s and early 2000s, rappers like Biggie, UGK and Busta Rhymes flaunted their furry foliage on magazine covers and in the street. In the 1950s, nearly 50 percent of all fur coat sales were men. But\u2014for reasons involving the uncompromisingly militant Animal Liberation Front, PETA and most memorably a distributed image by David Bailey that showed a model trailing a fur coat oozing blood on the catwalk with the slogan: \u201cIt takes up to 40 dumb animals to make this but only one to wear it\u201d\u2014after the 1950s, fur for men nearly disappeared. The Fur Information Council of America says there have been \u201csignificant gains in sales of men\u2019s fur fashions\u201d over the past several years. They now account for nearly 5 percent of total fur sales. For women, wearing fur has never acquired the same nouveau-riche connotations. While it\u2019s just as expensive, fur coats for women are seen as more elegant, opulent, even natural. Famously chic Anna Wintour can often be spotted wearing various fur coats and jackets in the colder months. So why not the same for men? The short answer: It\u2019s more fun to be bad than bougie.
