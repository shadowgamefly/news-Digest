{"name": "318", "parent": "", "content": "Get Rid Of Your High Expectations How many times in your life have you experienced hurt, disappointment, anger, or stress, from the difference between your imagination and reality? We\u2019re very creative creatures. And when we set out to do things, we always expect that everything will turn out exactly the way we want. Does this sound familiar? Chances of those scenarios coming true? I don\u2019t know exactly. But I guess it\u2019s somewhere close to ZERO. I\u2019m not trying to bash your dreams here. But a little pragmatism can never hurt. It\u2019s not practical to have high expectations because they hardly come true. So why have them in the first place? They do more harm than good. When I was getting a master\u2019s degree in business administration, I was secretly rubbing my hands all time. I thought that all the multinationals would line up to hire me. And because I specialized in marketing, I thought I could start any company and turn it into a success. But when I got my degree over six years ago, there was a financial crisis going on. Only one or two of my friends, classmates, and people I knew got hired by large firms. The rest took shitty jobs because it was slim pickings. I started a business. But that wasn\u2019t too pretty either. We bootstrapped the business. And I basically earned enough money to pay for my living expenses for the first three years. That was my goodbye to high expectations. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have high standards or aim high in life. Those things are good. But just don\u2019t rely on your imagination for timelines and outcomes. It\u2019s counterproductive. Barry Schwartz, a psychologist, and author of The Paradox of Choice, put it best: \u201cThe secret to happiness is low expectations.\u201d Now, this is not new information. Most of us know that high expectations are not helpful. Why do we still have them? We still desire more, more, more. And when you want more, you expect more. You see? You can\u2019t fix your expectations without fixing your desires. \u201cBut how can you get the most out of life and not strive for more? That doesn\u2019t make\u00a0sense.\u201d Well, a lot of things in life don\u2019t make sense. But here\u2019s the thing: When you desire more, you also have more options. \u201cWhat should I do? Work more? Earn more money? Help more people? Spend more time with my family?\u201d In general, having more options is a bad thing. More means confusion. And confusion often results in anxiety and regret. Do you know this feeling: \u201cWhat if I made the wrong decision?\u201d So more isn\u2019t better. What\u2019s wrong with 0.1% growth? Or with making less money and having more time for personal things? \u201cYeah, but I want it\u00a0all!\u201d Now we\u2019re getting somewhere. You want it all! And I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not possible. Just don\u2019t expect it. Don\u2019t expect the world from yourself. And more importantly: Don\u2019t expect so much from others. No one\u2019s perfect. People will disappoint you sometimes. And vice versa. Accept that it\u2019s not the end of the world. When you live your life free of expectations, you see things for what they are. Don\u2019t wish that things were better. Make them better. Thanks for reading!
