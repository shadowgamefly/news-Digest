According to a statement, law enforcement officials apprehended Juan Thompson this morning on charges of cyberstalking a \u201cformer romantic interest\u201d by, among other things, allegedly making bomb threats against JCCs and the Anti-Defamation League in her name. \u201cThreats of violence targeting people and places based on religion or race\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever the motivation\u200a\u2014\u200aare unacceptable, un-American, and criminal,\u201d U.S. attorney Preet Bharara said in a press release. According to Bradd Jaffy of NBC, the arrest of Thompson is unlikely to end the onslaught of JCC threats, as Thompson is believed to be a \u201ccopycat\u201d culprit who used threats against JCCs to \u201csettle a personal score.\u201d \u201cThompson\u2019s alleged pattern of harassment not only involved the defamation of his female victim, but his threats intimidated an entire religious community,\u201d FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said. Based on the Twitter account quoted in the FBI complaint, the suspect appears to be the same Juan Thompson who was fired from the Intercept for fabricating stories. The editor-in-chief of the Intercept, Betsy Reed, told BuzzFeed she believes the Twitter account belongs to the site\u2019s former writer. Violence against women, which takes many forms, has been identified as a precursor to erratic and sometimes violent behavior. As ThinkProgress reported last year, 40 percent of mass shootings between 2009 and 2012 started with a shooter targeting his girlfriend, wife, or ex-wife. In 2015 alone, nearly a third of mass shooting deaths included some element of domestic violence. UPDATE: The Anti-Defamation League has released a statement applauding the arrest, and calling for authorities to resolve other pending cases as well. \u201cWe are relieved and gratified that the FBI has made an arrest in these cases. We applaud law enforcement\u2019s unwavering effort to resolve this matter\u201d Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO, said. \u201cWe look forward to the quick resolution of the remaining open cases.\u201d ", "title": "Man arrested for making JCC bomb threats to intimidate a former love\u00a0interest", "sentences": [{"ad16": "Man arrested for making JCC bomb threats to intimidate a former love\u00a0interest"}, {"27d2": "Authorities say he is a \u201ccopycat\u201d culprit who made threats against JCCs to \u201csettle a personal\u00a0score.\u201d"}, {"9101": "Federal authorities announced on Friday that they have arrested the man they believe has participated in the rash of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) across the country since January."}, {"936c": "According to a statement, law enforcement officials apprehended Juan Thompson this morning on charges of cyberstalking a \u201cformer romantic interest\u201d by, among other things, allegedly making bomb threats against JCCs and the Anti-Defamation League in her name."}, {"589b": "\u201cThreats of violence targeting people and places based on religion or race\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever the motivation\u200a\u2014\u200aare unacceptable, un-American, and criminal,\u201d U.S. attorney Preet Bharara said in a press release."}, {"2197": "According to Bradd Jaffy of NBC, the arrest of Thompson is unlikely to end the onslaught of JCC threats, as Thompson is believed to be a \u201ccopycat\u201d culprit who used threats against JCCs to \u201csettle a personal score.\u201d"}, {"4369": "\u201cThompson\u2019s alleged pattern of harassment not only involved the defamation of his female victim, but his threats intimidated an entire religious community,\u201d FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said."}, {"36b7": "Based on the Twitter account quoted in the FBI complaint, the suspect appears to be the same Juan Thompson who was fired from the Intercept for fabricating stories.
