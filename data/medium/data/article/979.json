{"name": "979", "parent": "", "content": "16 Memorable Books I read in\u00a02016 Rewarding reads on love, life, knowledge, history, the future, and tools for thinking. Out of all the books I read this year, here is a list of what I found most worth reading in 2016. 1. The Psychology of Man\u2019s Possible EvolutionThese lectures, which were originally called Six Psychological Lectures, were first privately printed in the 1940s. Of the first run of 150 copies, none were sold. The essays were published once again after Ouspensky\u2019s death, and unlike last time became a hit. While the book is about psychology, it\u2019s different than what we think of as psychology\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cfor thousands of years psychology existed under the name philosophy.\u201d Consider this a study in what man may become\u200a\u2014\u200aby working simultaneously on knowledge and inner unity. 2. The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for MeaningImagine the sum of our knowledge as an Island in a vast and endless ocean. This is the Island of Knowledge. The coastline represents the boundary between the known and unknown. As we grow our understanding of the world, the Island grows and with it so does the shores of our ignorance. \u201cWe strive toward knowledge, always more knowledge,\u201d Gleiser writes, \u201cbut must understand that we are, and will remain, surrounded by mystery.\u201d The book is a fascinating and wide-ranging tour through scientific history. (Dig Deeper into this amazing read here.) 3. When Breath Becomes AirIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve cried reading a book. This beautifully written memoir, by a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with terminal cancer, attempts to answer the question What makes a life worth living? If you read this and you\u2019re not feeling something you\u2019re probably a robot. 4. The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information AgeThe book, which argues \u201cthe information revolution will destroy the monopoly power of the nation-state as surely as the Gunpowder Revolution destroyed the Church\u2019s monopoly,\u201d is making the rounds in Silicon Valley and being passed around like candy. Even if its forecasts are controversial, the book is a good read and it\u2019s full of interesting and detailed arguments. I have underlines on nearly every page. \u201cInformation societies,\u201d the authors write, \u201cpromise to dramatically reduce the returns to violence\u00a0\u2026 When the payoff for organizing violence at a large scale tumbles, the payoff from violence at a smaller scale is likely to jump. Violence will become more random and localized.\u201d The Sovereign Individual, who, for the first time \u201ccan educate and motivate himself,\u201d will be \u201calmost entirely free to invest their own work and realize the full benefits of their own productivity.\u201d An unleashing of human potential which will, the authors argue, shift the greatest source of wealth to ideas rather than physical capital\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201canyone who thinks clearly will potentially be rich.\u201d Interestingly, in this potential transition, the effects are \u201clikely to be centered among those of the middle talent in currently rich countries. They particularly may come to feel that information technology poses a threat to their way of life.\u201d The book predicts the death of politics, \u201cweakened by the challenge from technology, the state will treat increasingly autonomous individuals, its former citizens, with the same range of ruthlessness and diplomacy it has heretofore displayed in its dealings with other governments.\u201d As technology reshapes the world, it also \u201cantiquates laws, reshapes morals, and alters preconceptions. This book explains how.\u201d 5. To Kill a MockingbirdI know, I know. Hear me out. Someone I respect mentioned that he thought Atticus Finch was the perfect blend of human characteristics. Tough and skilled, yet humble and understanding. He\u2019s frequently rated as a \u201cmost admired\u201d hero in fiction, yet he\u2019s a lawyer competing with Jedis, Detectives, Spies, and Superheroes. Isn\u2019t that kind of interesting? Since it had been at least 15 years since I\u2019d read TKM, I wanted to go back and remember what made Atticus so admired. His courage, his humility, his understanding of people. I forgot just how perceptive Finch was when it came to what we\u2019d call \u201cgroup social dynamics\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahe forgives the individual members of the mob that show up to hurt Tom Robinson simply because he understands that mob psychology is capable of overwhelming otherwise good people. How many of us would be able to do that? Atticus Finch is certainly a fictional, and perhaps \u201cunattainably\u201d moral hero. But I will point out that not only do real life \u201cFinch\u2019s\u201d exist, but that even if we don\u2019t \u201carrive\u201d at a Finchian level of heroic integrity and calm temperament, it\u2019s certainly a goal worth pursuing. Wise words from the book Rules for a Knight sums it up best: \u201cTo head north, a knight may use the North Star to guide him, but he will not arrive at the North Star. A knight\u2019s duty is to proceed in that direction.\u201d (Here are some of the lessons I took away from the book.) 6. Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master\u2019s Insights on China, the United States, and the WorldIf you\u2019re not familiar with Lee Kuan Yew, he\u2019s the \u201cFather of Modern Singapore,\u201d the man who took a small, poor island just north of the equator in Southeast Asia with GDP per capita of ~$500 in 1965 and turned it into a modern powerhouse with GDP per capita of over $70,000 as of 2014, with some of the lowest rates of corruption and highest rates of economic freedom in the world. Finding out how he did it is worth anyone\u2019s time. This book is a short introduction to his style of thinking: A series of excerpts of his thoughts on modern China, the modern U.S., Islamic Terrorism, economics, and a few other things. It\u2019s a wonderful little collection. (We\u2019ve actually posted about it before.) Consider this an appetizer (a delicious one) for the main course: From Third World to First, Yew\u2019s full account of the rise of Singapore. (Dig deeper here.) 7. An Illustrated Book of Bad ArgumentsPerfect summer reading for adults and kids alike. One friend of mine has created a family game where they all try to spot the reasoning flaws of others. The person with the most points at the end of the week gets to pick where they go for dinner. I have a suspicion his kids will turn out to be politicians or lawyers. 8. Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for ThinkingDan Dennett is one of the most well known cognitive scientists on the planet\u00a0. This book is a collection of 77 short essays on different \u201cthinking tools,\u201d basically thought experiments Dennett uses to slice through tough problems, including some tools for thinking about computing, thinking about meaning, and thinking about consciousness. Like Richard Feynman\u2019s great books, this one acts as a window into a brilliant mind and how it handles interesting and difficult problems. If you only walk away with a few new mental tools, it\u2019s well worth the time spent. (You can learn a lot more about Dennett here, here, and here.) 9. The Seven Sins of Memory (How the Mind Forgets and Remembers)I found this in the bibliography of Judith Rich Harris\u2019 No Two Alike. Schacter is a psychology professor at Harvard who runs the Schacter Memory Lab. The book explores the seven \u201cissues\u201d we tend to find with regard to our memory: Absent-mindedness, transience, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence. The fallibility of memory is so fascinating: We rely on it so heavily and trust it so deeply, yet as Schacter shows, it\u2019s extremely faulty. It\u2019s not just about forgetting where you left your keys. Modern criminologists know that eyewitness testimony is deeply flawed. Some of our deepest and most hard-won memories\u200a\u2014\u200athe things we know are true\u200a\u2014\u200aare frequently wrong or distorted. Learning to calibrate our confidence in our own memory is not at all easy. Very interesting topic to explore. (We did a three part series on this book. Introduction and parts One, Two, and Three). 10. Talk Lean: Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better RelationsThis book is full of useful tips on listening better, being candid and courteous, and learning what derails meetings, conversations, and relationships with people at work. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not about leaving things unsaid that might be displeasing for other people. In fact, leaving things unsaid is often more detrimental to the relationship than airing them out. Rather, it\u2019s about finding a way to say them so people will hear them and not feel defensive. If you want to get right to the point and not alienate people, this book will help you. I know because this is something, personally, I struggle with at times. 11. The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our WorldI recently had a fascinating multi-hour dinner with the author, Pedro Domingos, on where knowledge comes from. Historically, at least, the answer has been evolution, experience, and culture. Now, however, there is a new source of knowledge: Machine learning. The book offers an accessible overview of the different ways of machine learning and the search for a master, unifying, theory. The book also covers how machine learning works and gives Pedro\u2019s thoughts on where we\u2019re headed. (Dig deeper in this podcast.) 12. Why Don\u2019t We Learn from History?This is a short (~120pp) book by the military historian and strategist B.H. Liddell Hart, a man who not only wrote military history but surely influenced it, especially in Germany in the World War period. He wrote this short synthesis at the end of his life and didn\u2019t have a chance to finish it, but the result is still fascinating. Hart takes a \u201cnegative\u201d view of history; in other words, What went wrong? How can we avoid it? The result of that study, as he writes in the introduction, is that \u201cHistory teaches us personal philosophy.\u201d Those who learn vicariously as well as directly have a big leg up. Something to take to heart. I plan to read more of his works. 13. A Powerful Mind: The Self-Education of George WashingtonWhat a great book idea by Adrienne Harrison. There are a zillion biographies of GW out there, with Chernow\u2019s getting a lot of praise recently. But Harrison narrows in on Washington\u2019s self-didactic nature. Why did he read so much? How did he educate himself? Any self-motivated learner is probably going to enjoy this. 14. Sapiens: A Brief History of HumankindOne of the best books I\u2019ve come across in a long time. Sapiens is a work of \u201cBig History\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ain the style of Jared Diamond\u2019s Guns, Germs, and Steel\u200a\u2014\u200athat seeks to understand humanity in a deep way. Many of Professor Harari\u2019s solutions will be uncomfortable for some to read, there is no attempt at political correctness, but his diagnosis of human history is undeniably interesting and at least partially correct. He draws on many fields to arrive at his conclusions; a grand method of synthesis that will be familiar to long-time Farnam Street readers. The book is almost impossible to summarize given the multitude of ideas presented. But then again, most great books are. (Dig deeper into this amazing read here, here, and here.) 15. Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living A refreshing signal in world of noise that should be read and immediately re-read. There is so much goodness in here that scarcely will you find more than a page or two in my copy without a mark, bent page, or highlight. The entire book offers texture to thoughts you knew you had but didn\u2019t know how to express. 16. The Happiness Trap: How to Stop Struggling and Start LivingThe way most of us search for and attempt to hold onto fleeting moments of happiness ends up ensuring that we\u2019re miserable. A great practical book on developing mindfulness, which is so important in many aspects of your life, including satisfaction. Might be the best self-help book I\u2019ve read.
