{"name": "1168", "parent": "", "content": "The Art of Working\u00a0Alone A few months ago I met someone who was on what she referred to as a \u201cradical sabbatical\u201d, and we bonded together over the thrill of self-direction. Until I realized that\u200a\u2014\u200aas best I could tell\u200a\u2014\u200aher sabbatical involved traveling the world and partying while living off her savings. It sounded like a blast, but I couldn\u2019t help the judgment creeping in the side of my brain. \u201cOh, she\u2019s calling her thing a sabbatical but really she\u2019s just taking a vacation. My sabbatical is going to be so much different. In my sabbatical I\u2019ll actually learn and accomplish things.\u201d Heh. Accomplish what, exactly? The problem with not having anything to do is\u2026 well, that you don\u2019t have anything to do. Or maybe more accurately you have anything to do. Anything and everything is on the table. How do you pluck a task out of the wide open space of future possibility? How do you allocate an hour in the seemingly infinite expanse of time before you? It can be a bit paralyzing. Fortunately I have a good amount of experience getting things done from my professional days. So what I know\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least what I believe\u200a\u2014\u200ais that it\u2019s the structure that\u2019s critical. The creation of a system by which you can put in ideas, apply a sprinkle of reflection and prioritization, and pop out useful output on the other side. Having the right systems in place is like riding a train\u200a\u2014\u200ayou just have to stay on the rails and you\u2019ll make continual progress towards your destination. \u201cStartup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEric Ries, The Lean\u00a0Startup My Systems Here are some of the systems I\u2019m going to be trying during my six month experiment. They represent a distillation of the productivity lessons I\u2019ve learned over the past ten years applied to my current situation and goals. I\u2019ll say a bit about each of these below. Constant Goal-setting I decided that my primary unit of work would be a week, so I\u2019m using weekly goals, set every Monday, to try and keep myself on track. I\u2019m also using daily goals\u200a\u2014\u200aset first thing in the morning before I do anything else\u200a\u2014\u200ato try and direct each day. I keep my goals in a simple Google doc. My weekly goals sit on the top of the doc, and my daily goals go right below them. Here\u2019s what it looks like: Yes, I\u2019m playing with something MailChimp related With this format I can see quickly how my daily goals are working towards my weekly ones and make sure I\u2019m not getting off course. I can also easily how I\u2019m doing on the day\u2019s goals. If I don\u2019t accomplish a goal on a given day I have to manually bring it up to the next day, or decide to drop it\u200a\u2014\u200awhich I\u2019ve found to be a useful exercise to go through each morning. I\u2019ve built weekly goal reviews into a retrospective process I\u2019m doing every week which I\u2019ll talk more about in a bit. I\u2019ve found so far that regularly setting and thinking about goals has been useful in directing my time and keep me from going down rabbit holes. Relentless Time\u00a0Logging I\u2019ve long been a huge believer in tracking my time and have done it professionally for many, many years (first by policy and now by choice). I believe that diligent time logging will be key to ensuring I spend my time well\u200a\u2014\u200acreating visibility and accountability into my schedule. Like goals, I\u2019m building timespend review into my weekly retro process which lets me course correct or reflect when my time goes differently than I expected. How I spent time in my second week Shipping Weekly With something so open-ended as my sabbatical, I know there is a high risk of \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe state of over-analyzing a situation so that no decision or action is never taken. To help overcome this I have a broader goal to ship something every week. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m currently counting polished blog posts, though that will hopefully change\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea is just to put something out into the world on a regular basis as a forcing function to prevent churning on things until they are perfect. This fits in well with the weekly goals, which, presumably should always include shipping something. Regular Retrospectives Professionally I\u2019ve always found retrospectives to be super useful and yet often observed that they are rarely done unless built into a process. Why look to the past when we can do the stuff that\u2019s in front of us? I already mentioned this, but I\u2019ve decided to do weekly retrospectives to reflect on the week, see how I did with my goals, look at my timespend, and assess my overall emotional state (can\u2019t forget about that!). Here\u2019s an example one from my first week. Writing Publicly Another tactic I\u2019m trying is writing regularly, and I have the goal of publishing everything I write. I\u2019m doing this for a few reasons. Writing helps clarify my own thinking I actually started this post on the first day of my sabbatical, because I wanted to map out what the structure of my days and weeks would be like. In writing it down, I was able to solidify the process and better understand why I\u2019m doing the things I am. Writing publicly helps me get input and feedback So far, just by writing about things publicly I\u2019ve already had people reach out and 1) give me great advice, 2) give me frank feedback on my ideas (spoiler: they\u2019re mostly bad), and 3) pitch me things. Having this community has already helped me with one of the pitfalls I was worried about going into this: the isolation of working alone. Just write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can write better. I believe that everyone should write in public.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSeth Godin, Talker\u2019s\u00a0block Writing is an interesting avenue for experimentation Not knowing what I\u2019ll be doing yet, I have the opportunity to test based on people\u2019s interest (or lack thereof) what topics I can write about in an engaging way. This might help inform what type of market or audience I should target down the road. Writing creates some accountability Finally, I\u2019m hoping that by writing about the sabbatical I will actually be forced to follow through on it. It would be much easier to keep quiet about what I\u2019m doing, and then if I never accomplish anything worthwhile I can say I just took six months off. While that would be nice\u200a\u2014\u200aand quite frankly a lot easier and less anxiety-inducing\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not aligned with my goals for this period of my life. Making Time for\u00a0Learning One of my biggest goals for this period was to learn a lot and I suspect that most of the learning I have will be in the process of working on things. Everything I\u2019ve built so far has used at least one or two technologies new to me. I\u2019m trying to get better at front-end design. And of course I\u2019m trying to improve my writing abilities. However, even though I\u2019ve always been a proponent of the learning-by-doing style, I also know that every time I take the time to actually study something I almost always find it super valuable (and usually complete the experience feeling like I should have studied that thing ages ago). So in addition to learning through my work I\u2019m explicitly blocking out time each week for pure learning\u200a\u2014\u200athings like reading books and blogs, taking online courses, or watching instructional videos. For this I\u2019m hoping to set both a minimum time (so I don\u2019t forget to do it) and a maximum (so I don\u2019t get so consumed by reading that I forget to produce). The current sweet spot I\u2019m targeting is 2\u20135 hours a week. Going back to the bigger\u00a0picture So having made some headway on some of the peripherals about how I\u2019m going to work I still don\u2019t have a clear sense how I\u2019ll actually chose what to work on. When the \u201cthinking and talking about how to do work\u201d turns into the actual doing of work\u200a\u2014\u200ahow will I know that I\u2019m doing the right thing? How can I be confident that my weekly progress is actually working towards a bigger picture? The short answer is that I don\u2019t really know yet. I\u2019m mostly hoping that will fall out from working within these systems\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like these systems fell out from my first goal being \u201cdefine a rough shape of my day-to-day working structure\u201d. I\u2019m on the rails now so let\u2019s see where this train is going! If you made it this far thanks so much for reading!
