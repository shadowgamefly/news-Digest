Garcia and Rodriguez, who were appointed by President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush, respectively, explicitly stated that districts were drawn to \u201cminimize Hispanic electoral opportunity.\u201d The ruling specifically named three congressional districts that need to be withdrawn\u2014 District 23, District 27, and District 35. Currently, two of those districts are represented by Republicans, while the other is represented by a Democrat. The order also said that the legislature manipulated the votes in District 26, a district in North Texas, through \u201cpacking and cracking\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning purposefully packing traditionally conservative voters in one district, while cracking traditionally liberal voters across multiple districts. Though this order didn\u2019t invalidate District 26, redrawing three districts will by default alter the parameters of many surrounding districts. This ruling had been long awaited. The case was originally filed in 2011 as a response to the congressional redistricting that occurred after the 2010 census in Texas. In 2013, the district court found evidence that legislatures had been intentionally discriminatory when redrawing the districts, but when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, the case stalled. If the Supreme Court upholds this ruling, minorities in Texas could have much more electoral influence in future elections.
