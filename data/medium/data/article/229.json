Written by me, to explain how some people think\u2026 The \u201cLoveless Man\u201d Every girl I have ever been in a relationship with, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to cheat on. In fact I\u2019ve cheated on every girl I\u2019ve had: \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d \u201cpotential romance,\u201d you name it. There was this one time, I had a fiance. I bought her the engagement ring and everything, told her how much I love her, did that thing where you get on one knee. It\u2019s hysterical how much she really believed me, I didn\u2019t feel a thing. I saw her face tear up. I saw it in her eyes, this happiness, the kind that overwhelms a person; the kind that makes one thing that for a second the world stands still. I saw her realization that for once in her life everything is working out for her. Meanwhile, I just wanted to see her face when she realizes it\u2019s all a lie. When her tears don\u2019t overflow in joy, but are withdrawn, puff up the face and are afraid to fall. It\u2019s all a game. She fell for someone who would never fall for her. She says, \u201cI\u2019ve never believed in love until I met you.\u201d And I just think the whole time, \u201cI\u2019ll never believe in love until I break your heart to prove it exist.\u201d I break hearts you might say, but never intentionally. I\u2019d like to think that it is society that breaks their hearts. Teaches these women to depend on a guy like me, teaches them to think there exist a thing like soulmates. What they think they know of me, and what they have been taught to accept of me by generalities based off my natural tendencies to be a \u201cnice\u201d guy. Their misconceptions of what actually is the reality is what breaks their hearts. I am of the school of thought, where to live simply means to adapt and survive. I don\u2019t entangle myself with the peculiarities and subtleties of love. I\u2019m a renaissance man, my freedom is logic- my art is reason. Either I be indulged or indulge. The present moment is my forte. So ladies, if we encounter, I mean no harm. The way I treat a lady, is only an extension of my own conception of love. Some people love differently than others, I love in a way our society may not currently understand. Certainly God Himself would not hold me accountable for my own perception of love, so neither should you. Love is love.
