The sheer number of typos are unsettling. And I can only spot them when the article is published. Thank goodness for the Edit button. But I will keep on making typos for these 100 posts, even if I need to correct them later, because I am still finding my voice for future blogging. After these 100 posts, I (probably) will spend weeks researching for one post, then use a week to write and proofread it. If those long posts have typos, I will be in trouble. So please forgive me for the typos I have made for now. I will spot them and change them soon.
