Here are some design executions that make Stardew Valley so addictive: Game Flow Have you ever thought of playing a game (or doing any activity, really) for 15 minutes, only to emerge three hours later, shielding your eyes from sunlight, looking for sustenance, and wondering where all the time had gone? If you have, it\u2019s most likely because you were caught in the throes of game flow.

In the middle of these two undesirable states is the promised land of flow, characterized by a loss of awareness and complete focus on the task at hand. Cognitive flow Almost every activity in Stardew Valley falls within the zone of flow. Let\u2019s take fishing as an example. After casting your fishing line and waiting for a hit, you enter into a battle of practice and reflexes, trying to keep the \u2018green box\u2019 inside the icon of the fish. Fishing In case it isn\u2019t clear from the GIF, this task is far from easy, especially when you\u2019re just starting out.
