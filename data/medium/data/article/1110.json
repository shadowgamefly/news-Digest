Robert Harvey was already scared. The priest at the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour in Silver Spring, Maryland, was readying for Sunday worship when he noticed that a sign outside the sanctuary had been defaced. The banner, which advertised a Spanish-language service, was now obscured with hateful graffiti: \u201cTrump Nation. Whites Only.\u201d It was a direct attack on their congregation, which Harvey told ThinkProgress is heavily Latino and is comprised of more than 85 percent immigrants. Members of the church hail from more than 50 countries. \u201cWe consider our diversity an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe consider immigrants the best part of who we are.\u201d \u201cWe consider our diversity an asset. We consider immigrants the best part of who we\u00a0are.\u201d But as swiftly as hatred darkened their church door, even swifter was the rush of support. Worshipers from across the Washington, D.C. area packed Our Saviour\u2019s pews that day in a show of prayerful solidarity, singing hymns underneath signs reading \u201cLove wins.\u201d Within days, a different banner spontaneously appeared outside the church, left by a good Samaritan: \u201cSilver Spring Loves and Welcomes Immigrants!\u201d The biggest surprise, however, came weeks later, when the church received a box in the mail filled with more than 550 cards reading, \u201cThere is strength in the diversity of our community. We stand with you against hatred and prejudice.\u201d Some were decorated with brightly colored crayons, and all were filled with handwritten notes of support scribbled by tiny hands. It took a moment for the staff to notice the signature on the back: \u201cYour neighbors at the Muslim Community Center Weekend School.\u201d Rev. Robert Harvey at his church in Silver Spring. CREDIT: Jack Jenkins/ThinkProgress Harvey was taken aback. He had never been in contact with the Islamic center before the incident\u200a\u2014\u200aand never would have expected such a robust, unexpected display of kindness from the strangers there. The gesture was just one of countless expressions of solidarity among religious communities in recent months. Although media attention has largely focused on the rash of hate incidents against minority groups across the country\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially Muslims, Jews, and immigrants\u200a\u2014\u200ahouses of worship have also quietly begun banding together to push back. Islamic groups have launched fundraising campaigns to help repair Jewish cemeteries desecrated by vandals, for instance, and Jewish groups have collected donations to rebuild mosques ruined by suspicious fires. Tasnuva Khan, the public relations chair for the Muslim community center in Silver Spring, said the idea to send letters to the Our Saviour congregation was inspired by a similar exchange the year before. Amid rising Islamophobia during the 2016 election season, a different Silver Spring church sent letters to the Islamic community written by Sunday school children in celebration of the Muslim celebration of Eid. \u201cIt\u2019s me today, it\u2019s going to be you tomorrow.\u201d But this year, she said, small expressions of compassion seem to carry a bit more weight. \u201cIt\u2019s me today, it\u2019s going to be you tomorrow,\u201d Khan said, noting that center\u2019s imam and other members also traveled to Our Savior to offer encouragement. \u201cWe need to support one another, and find ways to work together against the kind of hate and wrongdoing that has been going on.\u201d \u201cTo \u2018love thy neighbor\u2019 is the same in Islam as it is in Judaism as it is in Christianity,\u201d she added. \u201cWe believe you should not be able to sleep at night knowing that your neighbor is hungry or oppressed.\u201d Members of the Muslim Community Center of Silver Spring visit Our Savior.

It was only a few weeks later when the nearby Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington became one of the first JCCs to receive a chilling\u200a\u2014\u200aand increasingly common\u200a\u2014\u200abomb threat directed at Jewish institutions. Harvey said he and his staff saw the moment as an opportunity to \u201cpay it forward\u201d; they encouraged the congregation\u2019s children to write letters to the JCC during Sunday school, urging them to have courage in the face of animosity. \u201cA good deed was done to us, so we wanted to pass it on to somebody else,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cAlso, we like the idea of doing it unexpectedly.\u201d Michael Feinstein, head of the Greater Washington JCC, said the cards struck a chord. \u201cWhen I got their letters, I have to tell you, it blew me away,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cIn the aftermath of the bomb threat I was feeling very isolated\u200a\u2014\u200ait was very stressful\u200a\u2014\u200aand being targeted like that made us feel pretty alone. And then this envelope shows up with not only a letter, but also 9 or 10 index cards that the Sunday school kids had written, with pictures and crayons.\u201d Feinstein said the center has since received dozens of notes from all over the country, with Muslims, Christians, and atheists all voicing concern about the attack. But the cards from Our Savior represented the first batch he received, and are now on display in the entryway to the JCC. He made sure to pick up the phone to personally thank Harvey. \u201cHe was just totally shocked that I called him,\u201d Feinstein said, chuckling. One parent\u2019s story of enduring a bomb threat at a Jewish day school\u201cI wish I could say that I was surprised or shocked, but I was not.\u201dthinkprogress.org These kind of acts of solidarity are forming the foundation for a flurry of interfaith organizing activity. All three faith leaders who spoke to ThinkProgress described renewed efforts to forge what Harvey called \u201calliances\u201d with other groups, designed to resist the kind of hatred experienced by their communities and many others. The Church of our Saviour is hosting interfaith discussions in its sanctuary, for instance, and working to involve the congregation in a network of communities that support the New Sanctuary Movement\u200a\u2014\u200aan effort to harbor undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation.

It\u2019s also hosting a press conference to speak out against hatred this Friday, where Harvey\u200a\u2014\u200awho organizers made a point of inviting\u200a\u2014\u200awill finally meet Feinstein in person. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to know our neighbors,\u201d Harvey said. Khan said she and other members of her Islamic community had gone to \u201cso many interfaith programs in the D.C. area\u201d in the past few months that she\u2019s lost count. \u201cThe immigrant community, the Muslim community, and the Jewish community have been targeted right now in ways that we have not seen in a long, long time,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThis is actually bringing us together in ways that probably wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise.\u201d Indeed, faith groups are rapidly becoming a crucial part of the effort to resist Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies, which many experts believe are directly linked to uptick in hate. Remember that \u201cSilver Spring Loves and Welcomes Immigrants!\u201d sign outside Harvey\u2019s church? Kahn said it only took a few weeks for her to spot it at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where demonstrators held it aloft to protest the Trump administration\u2019s Muslim ban. Interfaith solidarity networks are primed to grow larger and more active as hate incidents continue, countering vitriol with virtue. So, too, will their dedication to spontaneous acts of kindness: When ThinkProgress asked Feinstein if he planned to repeat something akin to the letter-writing effort, he said the JCC was already considering reaching out to two nearby mosques that recently received threatening letters. Doing so will bring things full circle: One of those mosques was Kahn\u2019s Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring. \u201cOur brotherhood, sisterhood, and neighborliness is so much bigger than what is attacking us,\u201d Kahn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to show that right now.\u201d ", "title": "What religious solidarity looks like in Trump\u2019s\u00a0America", "sentences": [{"c3eb": "What religious solidarity looks like in Trump\u2019s\u00a0America"}, {"0c3c": "\u201cIt\u2019s me today, it\u2019s going to be you tomorrow.\u201d"}, {"ae91": "It was less than a week after the 2016 election, and Rev.
