Tentatively titled Dating Daddy\u2019s Little Girl the show never aired because Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner struck a mutually beneficial marital deal quickly. Ivanka wearing her little French number to create the impression that she\u2019s sophisticated and cultured when she\u2019s actually as crude, lewd, and rude as her licentious father. But the riveting Match.com audiotapes recorded that night still exist, as do the transcripts, which the dating site released on Monday. This is how the conversation between Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner unfolded about 20 minutes into their date, after the two exchanged pleasantries at the chic Japanese restaurant, Nobu, in New York City\u2019s Tribeca district: Ivanka: Listen, Jared, I don\u2019t know exactly how to put this but Daddy needs a Jew. Jared: Excuse me? Ivanka: I said Daddy needs a bona fide Jew in his inner circle, because he wants to make a serious run for the presidency in 2016, and if it\u2019s going to be successful he needs to have a real Jewish person around to make him look, you know, not so anti-Semitic, Waspy clansman. Jared: Ivanka, that\u2019s not only insulting to me as an orthodox Jew, it\u2019s incredibly calculating and frighteningly Machiavellian. I\u2019m not here to be your father\u2019s token Jew, a Hebrew puppet that he can exploit to achieve his political goals. Ivanka: Oh, don\u2019t start moralizing at me, mister. Your father went to jail for blackmailing his own sister, for Christ\u2019s sake. Your family has about as much integrity as the Corleones if they were Yiddiots instead of Italians. And sorry about saying Christ before, but hey, your people did kill him. Jared: Ivanka, if you don\u2019t stop all these Jewish slurs and insults I\u2019m going to have to leave. This is not okay! Ivanka: Just hold your hymie pants for a second and listen to what I have to say before you start going all bagel-dog on me. Jared: Ugh, there you go again, I can\u2019t have you\u2026 Jared has been going along with the grand plan of the Trump clan despite some slight misgivings as an Orthodox Jew in dealing with a notoriously Jew-hating Vladimir\u00a0Putin. Ivanka: Shut up and listen, dreidl boy. Daddy\u2019s got it all figured out with this huge, incredible plan. First, he\u2019s making Donnie Jr. take up hunting so he\u2019ll look like some kind of NRA gun nut. Then he has Eric walking around acting like an imbecile to attract the under-educated Christian right. My job is to marry a high profile snipcock so we have someone to keep the Jew York mainstream media mollified while Daddy gets his political machinery in place. If we all complete our assigned tasks, Daddy says he\u2019ll definitely be President of the United States in 2016. Jared: Ivanka, this is sick. Really sick. If you and your family think you can manipulate the American voter like this\u2026 Ivanka: Hey, did I say you could speak yet, no, so snap it shut, shylock. Okay, here\u2019s the deal\u200a\u2014\u200aif you and I get married, you\u2019ll be in line for an influential White House advisory position and your family will get a shitload of sweet real estate deals out of it. Early in their relationship, Ivanka kept her hand up the back of Jared\u2019s shirt so she could work him like a hand puppet in any direction she wanted to\u00a0go. Jared: Uh, no I won\u2019t get a White House position because that is called nepotism and it is illegal in the American system of government. And my family can\u2019t benefit financially from your father becoming president\u200a\u2014\u200alike that would ever happen anyway\u200a\u2014\u200abecause that\u2019s called political patronage and/or unjust enrichment, and both are also illegal. Ivanka: Oh, Jesus, Jared, can you really be so naive, you and those matzah-gobbler dimples of yours? First of all, Daddy isn\u2019t going it alone. He\u2019s got this semi-psychotic, white supremacist, political genius guy from Breitbart News who\u2019s ready to help us out. Second, he\u2019s been talking to Vladimir Putin about financing the whole deal and interfering in our presidential election to boot\u200a\u2014\u200aso no matter who Daddy faces he\u2019ll win the election. Even if he were to face FDR all whiny in his wheelchair, Daddy would still win. And sorry about that Jesus thing twice, but you know, the Jews really did kill him. Jared: Yeah, I heard you the first time about Jesus. Look, you and your \u201cDaddy\u201d are in total la-la land, Ivanka. And whether your father runs as a Democrat or a Republican, neither party trusts the Russians so that would just be political suicide. Wait, does your father even know what party he\u2019ll be\u2026 Donald Trump says he learned early from his father that Jews aren\u2019t real people \u201cotherwise I would have taken him under my wing like he was one of my own sons\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019s truly one of the nicest koshies I\u2019ve ever done business\u00a0with.\u201d Ivanka: Doesn\u2019t matter. Both parties are filled with pliable political idiots, so Daddy will decide which team of bozos he\u2019ll join when the time comes. Jared: Doesn\u2019t work like that, Ivanka, he needs to build a solid platform of liberal or conservative positions over years, even decades, or no one will take him seriously. He can\u2019t just flip-flop on issues based on personal whim at a moment\u2019s notice. People will think he\u2019s untrustworthy, erratic, even insane, and he\u2019ll destroy any chance of electability. Ivanka: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know as much about the political power game as those shnozzles running Israel. Jewpidity rules over there\u2014haha, I just made that up, putting Jewish and stupidity together. Haha. Anyway, Daddy and I and my brothers are going for this big time. And we need you, Jared. Did I mention that you would personally pocket $500 million working behind the scenes on some negotiation stuff? Jared: What stuff? Ivanka: Like probably Russia stuff, because who would believe that Putin would work closely with a penny-chaser? No one. So that will throw everyone off the scent. Jared: Russians hate Jews, Ivanka, and Jews hate Russians. I won\u2019t do it. Ivanka: Five. Hundred. Million. Dollars. Jared: There isn\u2019t enough money in the world\u2026 Ivanka: That\u2019s just the beginning, Goldberg. Once Daddy settles into the Oval and starts working directly with the Russian oligarchs, we\u2019ll all be skimming additional millions off the top every week. I might use the money to get into fashion, Donnie Jr. wants to open a bunch of bars, and Eric is thinking of investing in driverless cars. Daddy says we\u2019ll all be able to realize our dreams now. Jared: Driverless cars, what the\u2026? But, no, absolutely not, Ivanka, you can\u2019t just buy me. I do have some honor left. Ivanka: Like I said, Horvitz, that\u2019s just the start. Daddy\u2019s got a plan to actually sell the whole of the United States to Russia. And if he pulls it off, we\u2019re talking two or three trillion, with a \u201cT,\u201d maybe even more, split six ways. Jared: Trillion? You did say trillion?\u2026 Okay, so let\u2019s just say I wanted in\u2026what would I have to do next? Ivanka: We get out of this joint, go back to my place, you grab my pussy, and then you fuck me. Jared: Ivanka, please, we\u2019re on a first date, take it down a notch. Ivanka: Oh, brother, why are all you cliptips such sexual pussies? Look, you\u2019re going to take off my clothes and give it to me hard, like Daddy does. We need to start making humans, Jared, so Daddy has heirs to continue our dynasty. Jared: Trillions? You\u2019re sure about that, right? Ivanka: Trillions. Jared: Well, okay\u2026I guess. Ivanka: Trust me, Jewbacca, someday you\u2019ll be just as corrupt as me and Daddy. And almost as wealthy. ***** If you liked this post, please click the heart, comment, and/or follow me. I read every comment.
