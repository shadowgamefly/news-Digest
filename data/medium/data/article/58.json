{"content": "\u201cLynching\u201d is not a buzz-word Me, I\u2019m fish-belly white. Let\u2019s establish that right now. But I\u2019ve also been interested in African American history for about 30 years, and I\u2019ve been empathetic to their fight for rights in America since my father brought home a copy of The Underground Railway for me as a gift when I was 12. (I was 12!) So, when I see white folks using the word \u201clynching\u201d as if it\u2019s an applicable description of duress they\u2019ve experienced, it makes me lose my mind a little. White folks, we don\u2019t get lynched. We don\u2019t have a clue what lynching is like, or what the spectre of its possibility would feel like in our lives, ever. We don\u2019t have that history. (I\u2019ve been reminded of history on this; yes, white folk have been, but it\u2019s been awhile, and far less frequently than blacks.) Just today a column has emerged in Canada\u2019s esteemed Globe & Mail, written by Konrad Yakabuski entitled \u201cJoseph Boyden\u2019s lynching should set off alarm bells\u201d. You said what,\u00a0now? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Basically, the gist of this is the First Nations community here in Canada are saying to Boyden, \u201cBack that truck up, white boy, you\u2019re not so native as you think you are.\u201d But Konrad, in his infinite wisdom, likens this to President Obama, saying Obama isn\u2019t black, he was mostly white, but became black. Like Obama woke up one day, had a cup of coffee, only to discover he was drinking a big batch of pigment instead. I\u2019m sure most people just thought Obama was tanned and gave him a pass in America. Come on, man. Just because you\u2019re raised with a white parent doesn\u2019t mean you get to duck under the radar on skin colour. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to be scared when pulled over in a car for no reason in modern-day America. Being First Nations is More than Just\u00a0DNA Enter Joseph Boyden here in Canada. The First Nations experience here in Canada is filled with struggle. It didn\u2019t end in the 1870s; it barely ended in the 1980s. There are still reservations in Canada which don\u2019t receive clean drinking water. There are still Natives alive today who experienced the horrors of the Residential School Scandal. Eugenics, aka forced sterilization, were committed on First Nations in Alberta until the \u201970s. There are people alive who remember these experiences first-hand. Being native isn\u2019t just a matter of knowing how to make bannock and having great cheekbones, okay? For Boyden to just casually insert himself into that cultural heritage and reap societal acclaim and reward for it, that\u2019s something that First Nations people have a right to have a beef with. But here\u2019s the deal. No First Nations people have grabbed a rope. Boyden isn\u2019t swinging from a tree. He hasn\u2019t been beaten with tire irons, tarred, cut, or tortured in any way. Let\u2019s refresh your memory. This is what \u201clynching\u201d looks\u00a0like: And this is what a lynching reads\u00a0like: Ell Persons was a black man accused of, but never tried for, raping and murdering a white girl. In May, 1917, it was announced Persons would be lynched. Wikipedia explains how that spectacle/horror unfolded: The scene at Macon Road near the bridge on the day of the lynching was like a \u201choliday\u201d according to one newspaper, many people having stayed overnight. In the morning hundreds of men, women, and children gathered, and by 9.00 a.m. the road was packed with automobiles. A total of about 5,000 people attended the event, which had a carnival-like atmosphere according to Goings and Smith. Spectators bought soft drinks, sandwiches, and chewing gum, women wore their best clothes, and parents excused their children from school. One teacher at a school had 50 boys absent. Because of examinations, some county schools closed early, allowing the children to attend. Two trucks of drinks sold out swiftly, and sales of sandwiches and chewing gum were high.[4] Having arrived separately to Persons at about 9.00 am, Rappel\u2019s mother gave a speech: \u201cI want to thank all my friends who have worked so hard on my behalf\u00a0\u2026 Let the Negro suffer as my little girl suffered, only 10 times worse\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200asentiments which were echoed by the crowd. Persons was chained down, had a large quantity of gasoline poured over him, and set alight. The leader of the group had asked Rappel\u2019s mother if she wanted to light it; she declined, but said she \u201cwished Persons to suffer the tortures he dealt to his victim\u201d. Persons was reportedly calm and casual, and made no sound except for a \u201cfaint pig squeal\u201d when set alight. Mays said he stood close to his head \u201cin spite of the African odor\u201d and watched the whole performance. Members of the mob tried to help women who could not see get a better view, but they failed because of the sheer numbers. While Persons was burning, spectators snatched pieces of his clothes and the rope used to bind him. A newspaper described the moment of the lighting: \u201cA crowd of some 5,000 men, women and children cheered gloatingly as the match was applied and a moment later the flames and smoke rose high in the air and snuffed out the life of the black fiend.\u201d[5] Persons\u2019 body was decapitated and dismembered, and his remains were scattered and displayed across Beale Street\u200a\u2014\u200athe centre of the African American community in Memphis\u200a\u2014\u200awhere his head was thrown from a car at a group of African Americans. According to Charles W. Cansler, a spokesman for the local black community, his head was thrown into a room which contained black doctors. His remains were taken as souvenirs, and photographs of his head were sold on postcards for months after the event. The Commercial Appeal\u2019s headline the day after the lynching read: \u201cThousands cheered when negro burned: Ell Persons pays death penalty for killing girl\u201d, and their editorial on 25 May described the lynching as \u201corderly. There was no drunkenness, no shooting and no yelling.\u201d [6] So, no. Joseph Boyden isn\u2019t being \u201clynched\u201d by the media. Boyden is being questioned, challenged, disputed, confronted. He may feel he is being antagonized, bullied, chastised, castigated, hounded, belittled, harassed. But he is wrong, incorrect, mistaken, inaccurate, imprecise, erroneous. Words Matter,\u00a0Writers Remember the \u201cthesaurus\u201d? They\u2019re useful! I like them! In fact, in 2016, one doesn\u2019t even need to stand up, walk to a shelf, and thumb through a paperback thesaurus. All one needs to do is highlight a word in their writing program, right click, select \u201csynonyms,\u201d and you\u2019ll get a suitable list of alternatives. Computers are swell! There\u2019s no reason for lazy, entitled writers like Yakabuski to reach for the dramatic word to add oomph to their story. \u201cLynching\u201d is a word that must be struck from our vocabulary. Unless speaking about someone beaten and tortured to death then left on display like some sordid Halloween decoration, there is no way \u201clynching\u201d is the word you are looking for.
