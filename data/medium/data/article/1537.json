House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., arrives for a closed-door GOP strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, April 4, 2017. CREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite Congressman Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced Thursday that he is stepping down from his role in the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into alleged ties between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives. Nunes, who is the chairman of the committee, said that he will retain his post but will hand leadership of the investigation over to Reps. Mike Conaway (R-TX), Trey Gowdy (R-SC), and Tom Rooney (R-FL). Nunes\u2019 leadership of the investigation into the Trump campaign has long been controversial. A longtime Trump ally, Nunes also served as a member of the president\u2019s transition team. While leading the investigation into the president, Nunes agreed to make phone calls to the press on his behalf, leading to more questions about his partiality. And on March 22, Nunes held a press conference claiming to have evidence that some members of the Trump team were surveilled\u200a\u2014\u200aevidence he has failed to produce, has not revealed his sources for, and hadn\u2019t shared with other members of the House Intelligence Committee before telling the press. President Trump immediately took the bizarre announcement as vindication of his baseless claim that he was \u201cwiretapped\u201d by former President Barack Obama. Two days earlier, bother FBI director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rodgers said they didn\u2019t know of any information backing up the president\u2019s accusation. The totally phony Susan Rice story, explainedThe former national security advisor\u2019s surveillance activity is neither illegal or unethical.thinkprogress.org And despite Trump\u2019s claims of vindication, Nunes\u2019 announcement actually didn\u2019t actually reference anything illegal\u200a\u2014\u200abut in revealing it, he himself may have unethically revealed intelligence without authorization. He is now under investigation by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which he cited as his reason for recusal. His tone, however, was unrepentant. \u201cSeveral leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power,\u201d he said. While Nunes claimed that the investigation was a frivolous charge triggered by outside groups, the matter is far more serious. He is under a so-called \u201c18(a)\u201d investigation, reports The Daily Beast, which was not triggered by outside groups. The House Committee on Ethics also put out a statement saying that the investigation was internally triggered, a direct contrast to Nunes\u2019 characterization. \u201cThe Committee has determined to investigate these allegations in order to fulfill its institutional obligation, under House Rule X, clause 11(g)(4), to investigate certain allegations of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and to determine if there has been any violation of the Code of Official Conduct,\u201d the statement reads. The ethics investigation has subpoena power and may also spread to other top individuals, delving into what Nunes told President Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, has been openly critical of Nunes following his March 22 press conference. He applauded Nunes\u2019 decision. \u201cI know this was not an easy decision for the Chairman, with whom I have worked well for many years. He did so in the best interests of the committee and I respect that decision,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe important work of investigating the Russian involvement in our election never subsided, but we have a fresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands.\u201d Nunes designated Conaway as his lead successor, with Gowdy and Rooney as deputies. Conaway, like Nunes, is a Trump loyalist\u200a\u2014\u200aone who was a member of the very campaign he will now be in charge of investigating. Conaway was a member of Trump\u2019s Agriculture Advisory Committee, which Trump announced in August 2016. In January, Conaway gave his view on the Russian election hacking to The Dallas Morning News\u200a\u2014\u200aand compared it to Mexican entertainers campaigning for Hillary Clinton. \u201cHarry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into Las Vegas, to entertain, get out the vote and so forth,\u201d Conaway told the local paper. \u201cThose are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don\u2019t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that.\u201d He then told the paper he considered it on par with the Russian election hacking. \u201cIt\u2019s foreign influence. If we\u2019re worried about foreign influence, let\u2019s have the whole story,\u201d he said. Now, Conaway will be in charge of the investigation.
