I don\u2019t want to hear love songs that talk about hearts and flowers from You, and I don\u2019t want whispered words of how gentle and soft my skin feels, but I do want to hear You sing, I want to hear You sing songs of the dead while You moan my name in the grip of pleasure, I want You to recite odes in this ancient language where bodies intertwine with dead leaves and a taste of paradise awaits those who come for the pilgrimage. I want to sit on Your face, riding wave upon wave of sweet, ecstatic lust, to let You tie me up and fuck me into oblivion until the only thing that would matter is the purple marks You\u2019ll leave on my skin.
