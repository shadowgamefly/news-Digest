{"name": "1351", "parent": "", "content": "What the Women\u2019s March Cost One\u00a0Founder After an entrepreneur Instagrammed images in solidarity with recent protests, her investors responded with a shocking\u00a0demand On January 21, millions of people around the world marched in the name of women\u2019s rights. Tracy Heller wasn\u2019t able to join them because she was visiting a friend who had a death in the family, but she was determined to show her support. So, with the help of a social media intern who attended, she posted a handful of photos from the gathering on her company\u2019s Instagram page with signs featuring common slogans like \u201cThe Future Is Female\u201d and \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d Aside from being topical, the images were on-brand for her company. Heller founded Brooklyn Born\u200a\u2014\u200aan online retailer that sells stylish crib sheets and textiles made of organic cotton\u200a\u2014\u200awith the intent of building a brand that celebrates women. When she started the business in September 2016, she sourced a female-owned-and-operated factory in India to manufacture her products, worked with a handful of female consultants to develop the startup, and hired local female designers to create her prints. She also launched a blog named Real Moms Real Talk on her company\u2019s site, where she interviews friends who discuss the difficulties of transitioning into motherhood. \u201cI felt very strongly that we support [the march] on our social media, because we\u2019re a woman-owned company whose whole purpose for being is about supporting women and talking about women,\u201d says Heller, who is 31 and runs the company out of her Brooklyn apartment. After posting the images, Heller received a message from an investor. \u201cWe noticed on the Brooklyn Born Instagram account that a couple of political posts were made and wanted to express our unbiased opinion on the matter,\u201d began the email, which Heller provided to The Ringer. Heller had met this man\u200a\u2014\u200awhom she declined to name for this story for fear of legal retribution, and who did not respond to The Ringer\u2019s multiple requests for comment\u200a\u2014\u200athrough a mutual friend. The investor and two other male partners had given money to a Manhattan bar owned by a man who was dating a friend of Heller; the investors were part of an angel investing group that also funds a variety of early-stage tech and retail companies. Heller and the investor were introduced at an anniversary party, where she pitched him the business. After continuing the conversation via email, the investor and his partners agreed to contribute a small sum of money to Brooklyn Born in October 2016, with the understanding that they\u2019d be passive investors who wouldn\u2019t take on adviser roles. The note after the Women\u2019s March marked a reversal of that promise. \u201cIn today\u2019s political climate where there is a large amount of animosity between parties and their supporters that seems to grow daily, it seems even more critical for businesses to stay neutral so that no customers are \u2018turned off\u2019 to their products,\u201d the investor wrote. A back-and-forth followed, culminating in a tense phone call, Heller says. She agreed to be more thoughtful about what she posted to her company\u2019s feed going forward, but her investor wouldn\u2019t budge until she took down a previous post that featured Hillary Clinton and one showing the \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d sign, which he referred to as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d In a follow-up email, he said that if Heller refused to remove the images, he and his partners would demand their money back. \u201cIf we would have known this is the direction you were going to take Brooklyn Born then we would have not invested,\u201d he wrote to Heller. \u201cI took issue with having these three men, with their small investment checks, try to bully me and demand that I remove posts or else,\u201d Heller says. \u201cThat\u2019s just not kosher, that\u2019s just not really acceptable.\u201d Heller consulted an adviser on her board, who had listened in on one of the phone calls. The contract Heller had with the investors, which she provided to The Ringer, didn\u2019t allow them to pull their money based on a few stray Instagram posts. But even so, she was faced with the decision of whether or not to keep these men as a part of a business she had started for the purpose of uplifting\u200a\u2014\u200arather than silencing\u200a\u2014\u200awomen. Both sides hired lawyers, says Heller. Though Heller\u2019s experience is an especially jarring example of soliciting in the investment world, it did not happen in a vacuum. Startup founders shop for funding from a m\u00e9lange of investors, who can come and go at different stages of a company\u2019s gestation. Broadly, founders have the option of raising money from family and friends, rich people with money to spare (more formally known as angel investors), or a venture capital firm. There are upsides and downsides to all options. For one, friends and family don\u2019t always have deep pockets. But when it comes to procuring money from strangers, angel investors are often more accessible to new entrepreneurs than VC firms, which typically know more about the area of business they\u2019re funding. The former has tended to be somewhat riskier, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as buzz around the VC industry has drawn increased participation from less experienced financiers, says Josh Lerner, a professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School. Even if some angel investors may be experienced corporate executives, former entrepreneurs, or VCs who are investing on the side, others may be deeply unfamiliar with the investing world at large. \u201cYou have this very high-end, very sophisticated group of people, and then there\u2019s the proverbial doctors and dentists, who are investing on the basis of who they run into at the country club,\u201d Lerner says. \u201cIn many cases being much less sophisticated in how they accept the deal, how much value they can add to the company, and the like. So it\u2019s very much a mixed bag in terms of angel money.\u201d That element of inexperience can translate to strained investor relations, or less professional behavior, says Erin Shipley, a cofounder at the Helm Fund, a seed-stage VC investment group that focuses on female-founded companies. \u201cI have heard of plenty of instances of bad behavior in a fundraising context that female founders have experienced, but I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are a lot of different investor profiles that fund private companies at this point,\u201d she says. \u201cThere can be a difference in the way an institutional venture fund would treat a founder they invest in, [from the way] an individual who had put money into a company\u00a0\u2026 might feel more emboldened [to treat a founder].\u201d In some cases, the option to seek the support of a more institutional venture fund isn\u2019t an option. Barriers in raising funds can be so hard to overcome that \u201cquality money\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amoney from groups who will also act as advisers\u200a\u2014\u200ajust isn\u2019t as available to companies led by CEOs who are women and/or nonwhite. \u201cThere\u2019s this strong pattern that sociologists like to call homophily, which is that you tend to like people who are like yourself,\u201d says Lerner. \u201cThat means for minority or women entrepreneurs the challenges of raising venture money is very daunting, and in many cases they end up turning to angel money instead.\u201d Tracy Heller with the owner of the factory that makes Brooklyn Born products (Courtesy Tracy\u00a0Heller) Heller\u2019s experience is at the heart of a significant problem in the entrepreneurial community: Despite making up half the world\u2019s population, it\u2019s much harder for women to find investors in a male-dominated culture of venture capitalists. A 2016 TechCrunch survey found that just 7 percent of partners at top-100 venture firms are women. That gender gap is directly reflected in the startup world. About 38 percent of new businesses are started by women, but only between 2 and 6 percent of those founders receive VC funding, said Ethan Mollick, an assistant professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Last year, Bloomberg surveyed 890 U.S. startups founded between 2009 and 2015 that had received at least $20 million in VC and other equity funding. Only 7 percent of the founders on their list were woman. And those female founders\u2019 companies received an average of $77 million, compared with the $100 million given to male-led startups. These statistics are often illustrated by female entrepreneurs\u2019 horrifying tales of pitching male potential investors\u200a\u2014\u200atake, for example, the VC who was bold enough to suggest revamping a product meant to test period blood to instead evaluate testosterone levels. But the story of Brooklyn Born\u2019s Instagram account is also about the complicated territory female founders are forced to navigate even after securing funds. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for male investors, no matter the stake they have, to put inappropriate pressure on female founders,\u201d says Emily Best, the founder and CEO of Seed&Spark, a crowdfunding company for underrepresented filmmakers. To complicate this dynamic, the tech industry has been increasingly embroiled in political controversies (see: Uber), spurring a new movement of corporate activism. In the process of funding her own startup, Best says she encountered instances of bullying similar to Heller\u2019s related to both her gender and the political stances she expressed on behalf of her company. From a structural standpoint, when startup founders accept money from an individual or firm, the terms of the deal rarely allow for the money to be pulled later on. The greater risk is simply being stuck with an investor who feels emboldened enough to manipulate or harass. To avoid being pressured by investors, Best suggests that female entrepreneurs carefully vet potential investors before accepting their money. In some cases, she\u2019s turned away prestigious firms because a partner lacked listening skills or felt Best wanted too much control over her company. Though she calls her current male investors \u201cher greatest champions,\u201d she says she went through a lot to settle on the right people. \u201cOur experience has been that we\u2019re told we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing by some guys who haven\u2019t bothered to find out what we\u2019re doing and don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just learned to fucking take it. Sit there, listen, and just wait for them to go away. We don\u2019t follow up on that investment deal, we just walk away.\u201d One female startup founder, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, recently experienced a similarly controlling dynamic with several male investors from an angel group. After receiving their investment for her now one-and-a-half-year-old software company, she began fielding what she calls \u201ccondescending messages\u201d from several men within the group. The founder says that they referred to her as a \u201ccheerleader\u201d rather than a CEO and often told her she was too young to run her business properly. These comments continued for a year, until finally the investors demanded higher equity in the company, without the offer for more investment. When the founder refused, she says they wrote her an email in which they threatened to \u201cruin her\u201d if she did not comply. She attempted to ignore their comments, until, she says, another male investor who witnessed their behavior stepped in, called them out, and bought out their shares. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I think about too much, because sometimes it feels hard to differentiate between sexism and people not liking you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut ultimately it came to a head when another investor said that they were clearly treating me like a stupid woman.\u201d The difficulties faced by female entrepreneurs are not lost on Heller. \u201cThe fact that I ended up with investors who then turned out to be sort of misogynist is unfortunate,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish there were more options for women out there to get money from people who understand what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it. While my situation is pretty unheard of\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving investors demand their money back\u200a\u2014\u200ait does speak to this larger issue.\u201d Heller decided that even though she had already spent some of the investors\u2019 money, she was better off returning the remaining amount and severing ties with them. After three weeks of arguing, Heller says they finally settled: She gave them back 82 percent of their investment. Though she\u2019s not currently fundraising, she\u2019s considering a crowdfund to make up for the loss. \u201cThose things are a little bit up in the air,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to continue to run my business.\u201d For now, Heller is happy to have walked away without having to worry whether something she publishes on social media will be considered too political. Fittingly, she celebrated the resolution with an Instagram post that no investor could censor: ", "title": "What the Women\u2019s March Cost One\u00a0Founder", "sentences": [{"2d4b": "What the Women\u2019s March Cost One\u00a0Founder"}, {"ca6f": "After an entrepreneur Instagrammed images in solidarity with recent protests, her investors responded with a shocking\u00a0demand"}, {"7325": "On January 21, millions of people around the world marched in the name of women\u2019s rights.
