Subsequent reports indicated former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the unmasking. The totally phony Susan Rice story, explainedThe former national security advisor\u2019s surveillance activity is neither illegal or unethical.thinkprogress.org Early this month, Trump went as far as to tell the New York Times that he thought Rice had committed a crime. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the biggest story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.\u201d Rice, however, denied any wrongdoing. During an MSNBC interview, she explained that she was just doing her job. \u201cThere were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to, name not provided, just a U.S. person, and sometimes in that context in order to understand the importance of that report, and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out or request the information as to who that U.S. official was,\u201d she said.

In short, Nunes had no good reason to be concerned in the first place, and Trump had no good reason to cite Nunes\u2019 concern about the intelligence reports as somehow validating his reckless, evidence-free accusation. Nonetheless, during a Fox Business interview that aired Wednesday morning, Trump was still suggesting some sort of inappropriate surveillance occurred and that Nunes\u2019 intelligence reports validated him. \u201cWhen you look at Susan Rice and what\u2019s going on, and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018you were right when you said that.\u2019 Perhaps I didn\u2019t know how right I was because nobody knew the extent of it.\u201d Trump again characterized the Rice story as \u201csuch a big story, and I\u2019m sure it will continue forward, but what they did is horrible.\u201d In other words, even though the notion that Trump and his inner-circle were victims of inappropriate surveillance has now been debunked, don\u2019t expect the president to stop lying about it anytime soon. Meanwhile, the Washington Post broke news on Tuesday night that the FBI secured a secret warrant to monitor communications from Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page last summer. That story emerged on the same day the Associated Press reported that newly obtained financial records confirm former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort received at least $1.2 million in secret payments from a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party. Those stories are the latest indication among many that the intelligence community actually had good reason to be concerned about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
