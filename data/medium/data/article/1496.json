{"name": "1496", "parent": "", "content": "Trump Will Resign By The Summer\u200a\u2014\u200aHere\u2019s How It\u2019s Going To\u00a0Happen A prediction so logical, so entirely plausible, you\u2019ll be feeling more positive by the time you finish reading this\u00a0post Mark your calendars, people. The Great White Dope will leave the presidency of his own accord by the summer. It will happen in August, to be more precise. On August 18th, if you need to send out invitations for the resignation party. You think you\u2019ve got a headache, Herr Hopeless? We\u2019ve been wracked with a national migraine for\u00a0months. Why am I so sure about this bold, yet infinitely plausible prediction? Two reasons. One, I\u2019m a New Yorker. I\u2019ve lived on the same avenue as Donald Trump for about the same number of years (but downtown where the landscape is a truer blue). For decades, I\u2019ve watched this sleaze monkey operate, noted the many twisted expressions of his delusional self-importance, cataloged his rich history of lying, cheating, and exploiting the less fortunate and, like all New Yorkers (as noted in this post), I\u2019ve learned to deeply dislike and vigilantly avoid this bloated ass clown like he\u2019s hiding the Black Plague under his toupee. Second reason, and I apologize for this in advance, Donald and I share the same birthday. June 14th. Flag Day. Used to be a nice, low-key, patriotic holiday\u200a\u2014\u200aJuly 4th\u2019s less flamboyant cousin. Now, June 14th will be forever marked with an ugly orange Trump stain. That said, the shared birth date does gives me a kind of extra extrasensory, astrological insight into the workings of the man\u2019s maleficent mind and ginormous ego (which I\u2019ve written about here). So you see, I know him. I know him really well. But enough preamble, here\u2019s how this historic resignation is going to unfold: JANUARY 20th\u2013MARCH 31st: PRESIDENT TRUMP REALIZES HOW MUCH HE HATES THE JOB. His first 60 days in office have been a nightmare. His Muslim ban gets shot down by the courts. His Obamacare repeal and replacement blows up. Mexico isn\u2019t going along with paying for the wall. The Trump rally on Wall Street fizzles. Russian meddling in our election threatens to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency. He has pissed off longstanding allies and provoked trigger-happy enemies. And his approval numbers are the lowest in history. Most important to President Prima Donald, all the people he thought would be kissing his ass by now, the only audience of admirers he ever cared about\u200a\u2014\u200aHollywood celebrities, television stars, and wealthy media moguls\u200a\u2014\u200ahate his guts. They stayed away from his inauguration, won\u2019t return his calls, and avoid being seen in public with him like he\u2019s their imbecile half-brother. Add to that insult, the only people left who sort of like him are those who he has a long history of assiduously ignoring: the under-educated, underemployed, underfunded, underprivileged, and underachieving underdogs. It\u2019s all adding up to be a gigantic bust. With Commander Combover now the butt of every late night joke and easily the most illustrious laughingstock in American history. And, of course, in Mr. Yella Fella\u2019s thin-membraned mind, this cannot continue. Thus, the stage is set. APRIL 1st\u2013APRIL 23rd: THE FBI, NSA, CIA AND HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE START CLOSING IN ON HIM. Pissed off for being thrown under the bus, Paul Manafort speaks publicly before Congress, and privately to the Feds, and not only are Bannon, Sessions, Flynn, Tillerson, and Ross credibly linked to Putin and the Russian plan to interfere with our presidential election, so is Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. As the rising heat causes rivulets of perspiration to run down his pancake makeup, Trump begins to panic. He starts to lose sleep and the sleep deprivation causes him to become more erratic, eat more Cheetos, and send out even more absurd and abrasive predawn tweets. In a flurry of messages during a few short days in mid-April, he calls one key Senate ally a \u201cwalking wimp weasel,\u201d accuses Michele Obama of dissing Melania on Inauguration Day, disses Melania for being an absentee FLOTUS, and is heard on leaked recordings calling Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a \u201cslimy hymie.\u201d The blow back from all this is fast, furious, and crippling. Trump realizes that he not only hates being president, he also sucks at it. He starts talking to Bannon about \u201coptions.\u201d The plot thickens. APRIL 24th\u2013MAY 29th: IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FROM THE INEVITABILITY OF A TREASON INDICTMENT, TRUMP SPREADS DIVORCE RUMORS. He\u2019s seen it work on dozens of reality TV shows, including his own\u200a\u2014\u200aif you want to get the public\u2019s undivided attention while drawing scrutiny away from something you\u2019d prefer to hide\u2026create a scandal. And so he does. With help from Bannon, Trump and his daughter Ivanka develop an elaborate scheme to plant rumors about Melania having an affair with a billionaire movie producer (\u201cFuck those Hollywood hacks, let them suck this,\u201d says the president behind closed, but heavily wiretapped doors). The president then feigns heartbreak to curry favor with cuckolded men and sympathetic women. The Christian right declares outrage over Melania\u2019s alleged infidelity. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger issues a statement condemning the First Lady\u2019s indiscretions and supporting the president. By Memorial Day, a tearful President Trump says that he sadly must begin divorce proceedings against Melania, that the court case will likely last all summer, and that it will certainly be as riveting as OJ\u2019s, with even higher ratings, so no one should leave their TV sets until autumn. He assures the public that he\u2019ll do his best to keep them informed about all POTUS-FLOTUS divorce developments on a minute-by-minute basis and further announces that the cackling, crazy-haired television commentator Nancy Grace will be delivering additional play-by-play. The nation is voyeuristically focused on his marital soap opera and quickly forgets about the Russians in its own backyard. Trump thinks his devious plan is working. Until\u2026 MAY 30th\u2013JUNE 14th: PUTIN RELEASES THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN SHOWER VIDEO. Any goodwill that Trump has garnered playing the aggrieved husband goes out the window when the Russians decide his presidency is quickly unraveling, his usefulness is coming to an end, and the smartest option is to hasten his demise. And, that\u2019s when we see him, fully naked on our television sets\u200a\u2014\u200aa pasty, drooling, flesh cake of a man, a corpulent slug with his meticulous ridiculous hair-rug in place, lying under an alternating stream of warm liquid delivered by a fit foursome of nubile Russian prostitutes. If there is any doubt this is our very own pre-president receiving a Slavic sun shower, those doubts are erased when he looks up at the lithe ladies and announces, \u201cI\u2019m going to make all of you winners in my Miss Universe pageant, would you like that?\u201d Trump\u2019s Flag Day birthday present is a $6-billion-dollar counter-divorce action from a vindicated Melania. And the vise closes tighter. JUNE 15th\u2013JULY 20th: IF YOU CAN\u2019T DISTRACT THE PEOPLE WITH A SEX SCANDAL AND A MESSY DIVORCE PLAYED OUT ON THE NATIONAL STAGE, SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF THEM BY DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND MARTIAL LAW. If you thought Bannon was diabolical in the administration\u2019s first 100 days, wait till you see what he cooks up by midsummer with the president\u2019s blessing. Things are going so badly for Trumpty Dumpty at this point, impeachment is looking like a mild slap on the wrist. People in the streets are yelling, \u201cLOCK HIM UP!\u201d as it becomes apparent that he, and most in his inner circle, are about to be sanctioned, condemned, and indicted for serious crimes that start with colluding with the enemy, extend to fixing an election, touch on embezzling billions of dollars from the national treasury, and land firmly on treason\u2026with murder tossed in after a few Putin-style poisonings and roof tossings occur at Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C. hotel. Saving his presidency and, more important to Trump, his honor, legacy, and ability to indiscriminately grab pussy till the end of his days, now becomes a \u201cdo-or-die\u201d mission. Enter \u201cThe Unprecedented National Emergency.\u201d This isn\u2019t some quaint, Cheney-created, color-coded threat level. We\u2019re talking about\u2026ALIEN INVASION! You think that\u2019s preposterous, right, that now I\u2019m just being comical and absurd? Really? Need I remind you that this is the same paranoid, possibly mentally ill president who accused his predecessor of personally bugging his office at Trump Tower with absolutely no proof at all? Knowing that, you still think faking an alien takeover is too heavy-handed and asinine for The Lyin\u2019 King and his Dr. Evil sidekick? Are you sure? Consider this\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of crimes committed against this country by Trump, the size of which America has never seen before, would have to be met with an urgent existential threat to fully absorb the resources and attention of all the nation\u2019s intelligence organizations, law enforcement agencies, local police forces, even the military. And that\u2019s where planet-threatening aliens come in. On or around July 4th (that\u2019s right, Independence Day), the White House starts leaking rumors that a fleet of unidentified spacecraft seems to have entered our solar system. Despite denials from NASA, Russia\u2019s Roscosmos, and space agencies and astronomical observatories around the world, the Trump administration insists that there is a potential extraterrestrial invasion underway. All eyes, worldwide, turn slowly from their television sets, iPhones, and Instagram accounts to the heavens. Trump tweets on July 10th: Just saw intel no one else allowed to see\u200a\u2014\u200aUFO\u2019s headed directly for Earth\u2019s orbit. No hoax, not fake news. For real! TRUST ME!\u201d On July 12th, he tweets: Spacemen (and women) almost here. Good thing I have nukes ready. Keep eyes skyward, don\u2019t look at what I\u2019m doing down here. On July 15th, as panic fills the streets of every city in America and most of the world, he ramps up the fear: Just told Maddog Mattis to position intercontinental missiles. If E.T. lands here we\u2019ll nuke \u2019em. Good thing you didn\u2019t imprison me now, right? Suddenly, no one is thinking about Trump\u2019s long list of heinous crimes\u200a\u2014\u200anot with the Klingons at our orbital doorstep. And that\u2019s the moment when the venom-spitting Steve Bannon instructs Hair Fuhrer to deploy the ultimate presidential weapon: Martial Law. JULY 21st\u2013July 28th: JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE OUT OF THE WOODS AND HOME FREE, HAVING PULLED THE ULTIMATE SCAM ON AN ENTIRE NATION, YOU\u2019RE RAMMED UP THE ASS BY AN OLD SAILOR WHO\u2019S BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY TO EVEN THE SCORE. With Martial Law in place, and the imminent arrival of hive-minded bloboids with death rays sending paroxysms of terror across the nation, Trump and company are feeling quite smug in the Oval Office while issuing countless executive orders \u201cneeded to protect the country during this time of exceptional crisis,\u201d simultaneously tightening their iron chokehold on American democracy. But this is not where my plausible prediction ends. No, no, no. On or around July 28th, George Herbert Walker Bush\u200a\u2014\u200aformer WWII Navy flyer and 41st President of the United States, who is, yes, still alive\u200a\u2014\u200amakes a formal appeal to the White House that he be allowed to address the nation about the alien invasion from his summer home in Kennebunkport, ME. Trump, assuming Bush, a fellow Republican and former CIA Director, will support his crisis-driven, autocratic security measures, approves the old soldier\u2019s request for a national address. Here\u2019s what he will say: \u201cMy fellow Americans. I love this country, and I don\u2019t want to see it, or its host planet Earth, destroyed by extraterrestrials. Luckily, that\u2019s not going to happen\u200a\u2014\u200anot today, or tomorrow, or in the next century\u200a\u2014\u200abecause there are no aliens coming. It\u2019s total bullshit. For the past seven months you\u2019ve been lied to and jerked around by this mango-colored monstrosity of a human being who calls himself your president and somehow stumbled into the White House. (At this point, the White House tries to kill the satellite feed to Kennebunkport, but Bush has already received assurances from his old allies at the CIA and NSA that they\u2019ve neutralized any White House interference.) I want to assure you that Mr. Trump and his accomplices have fabricated this alien invasion story to deflect attention away from his massive misdeeds and miscarriages of justice, his treasonous conduct against this country, and his incredibly poor diet. Furthermore, I have been working behind the scenes with congressmen and senators from both parties to ensure that any further executive orders from the White House be nullified and the influence of President Trump be neutralized. The Martial Law decree will also be lifted. Criminal charges against the short-fingered vulgarian will be filed immediately, and Putin\u2019s papaya-flavored pawn will not be allowed to conduct business as usual or command the nation\u2019s armed forces going forward\u200a\u2014\u200aI have those assurances from my friends at the Pentagon. The day will come, my friends, when this nation sees the end of its rise as a great democratic stronghold and respected world power\u200a\u2014\u200abut that time isn\u2019t now, isn\u2019t soon, and certainly isn\u2019t on my watch. This is former President George Bush, saying goodnight and God bless.\u201d JULY 29th\u2013AUGUST 17th: A CRASH COURSE IN SPINNING AN EPIC LIE TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK GOOD AND YOUR COUNTRY LOOK BAD. With the entire house of cards crashing down around him in the days after the elder Bush\u2019s address, Trumplethinskin is desperate to find an \u201chonorable\u201d way out of his malignant predicament. On August 12th, he goes on national television and declares that \u201cold man Bush is a nice former president but totally senile and playing with a pouch full of loose marbles.\u201d He also doubles down on his alien fabrications, saying that the latest satellite pictures indicate that the alien spaceships are sneakily parked behind the moon where we can\u2019t see them, but could come out at any moment and present a dire threat to all earthly life as well as a comeback season for The Celebrity Apprentice. In an unhinged rage, the president says that no one is listening to him even though he\u2019s the only one who can save the country and the world. He says that the mainstream media is out to get him and won\u2019t let him operate without impunity. He declares that the government has broken down, that the system is totally unfixable, and that he has tried everything he can to make the country great again but is getting no cooperation. Sean Spicer runs in at this point with what the president says are the latest satellite images of the alien invaders. On closer inspection, these appear to be slightly-altered endoscopy photos from an esophageal exam. Nevertheless, the president presents them as definitive proof of an extraterrestrial breach. The Tangerine Tornado finishes by saying that he will be flying to Mar-A-Lago for the weekend and will be considering what else can be done to protect life on the planet while he plays a few rounds of golf. AUGUST 18th: THE RESIGNATION. Upon returning to Washington after his 33rd trip to Mar-A-Lago since becoming president, Mr. Trump is besieged by up to 10 million protesters surging against the gates of the White House. As Adolf Twitler leaves Washington for the last time, he\u2019ll give photographers one final opportunity to snap pictures of his impossibly small\u00a0hands. He takes to the airwaves again to announce that, just as he thought, Washington is \u201cfilled with nothing but a bunch of tight-ass paper pushers who don\u2019t have the slightest clue how to run a successful business operation. Sad. If this is the kind of government the people want, instead of letting me make America a world-class corrupt power, well then, there\u2019s nothing more for me to do here. It\u2019s hopeless. I have told Mike Pence that I\u2019m handing in my resignation and returning to New York.\u201d The president continues, saying, \u201cIf anyone wants to know what I\u2019ll be doing going forward, I\u2019m excited to announce that I\u2019ll be working with Steve Bannon, Roger Ailes, and some very good people, no, great people in the non-fake press world to create a really incredible new TV network that we\u2019ll be calling Trump International Media or TIM. But not tiny TIM. This is going to be huge. I\u2019m inviting my friends in show business to send me proposals now as we\u2019d like to have some great shows on the air for the new fall season. Thank you America and God bless me.\u201d As the president stands to leave the Oval Office, he is arrested by FBI agents and taken to an undisclosed location along with 15 other senior White House officials, including a barefoot Kellyanne Conway who is asked not to put her smelly feet up on the metal benches of the federal paddy wagon. Another of those taken into custody, suspected Russian cyborg Stephen Miller, explodes upon being lifted into an armored FBI transport van. Two agents are severely injured after being hit by shrapnel from Miller\u2019s splintered titanium body, but survive. And the country is ultimately saved.
