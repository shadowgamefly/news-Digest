{"content": "The Devin Nunes Ethics Probe is\u00a0Garbage Leftwing groups like MoveOn.org employ underhanded tactics to wage a PR battle against a man who knows too\u00a0much You may have heard last week that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has temporarily recused himself from the committee\u2019s Russia investigation due to his being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. It sounds like a damning indictment of Nunes that further serves to undermine all he\u2019s said and done over the past few weeks. But this so-called \u201cEthics violation\u201d is nothing more than an abuse of a legitimate system by Nunes\u2019 political enemies. It\u2019s a political ploy to sully Nunes\u2019 name and assail his credibility. He reported explosive, devastating truths about the Obama Administration, and so when you cannot refute what someone says, you refute the person himself. That\u2019s the strategy his enemies have employed. From Bloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake: This brings us the charges brought to Office of Government Ethics that spurred the House Ethics Committee to launch its probe. The committee is investigating whether Nunes violated rules prohibiting the disclosure of classified information when he held press conferences to discuss the reports he had seen. What is the violation? It\u2019s the fact that Nunes said publicly that he had seen summaries of raw intelligence reports that he said inappropriately contained details about the Trump transition and were not related to Russia. While the chairman never acknowledged that the sources of his information were NSA intercepts, any mention of any information collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is technically classified. This sounds worse than it is. This complaint, brought by a handful of lawyers who have been harsh critics of Trump and by progressive activists like MoveOn.org, is a ruse, meant to distract from the bigger question of how the Obama White House was receiving raw intelligence reports on the activities of Trump and his advisers after the election. Now, just because the allegations come from partisan leftwing organizations does not make them inherently bogus, because, at least in my view, every organization in the political arena is partisan, i.e. there are no unbiased sources. Biased, partisan sources can and often do uncover the truth. But in this case, the organizations accusing Nunes of ethics violations clearly have no case against him, and they know it, meaning they\u2019ve only leveled these charges to make Nunes look bad. As Lake says, this Ethics probe is a ruse meant to distract from Nunes\u2019 actual revelations, the stuff that makes the Obama administration look bad. Because Nunes\u2019 behavior was routine and not out of the ordinary: The infraction, if it was one, was not serious. Nunes did not disclose the targets of the surveillance or any details about how the information was collected. There is rarely a day that goes by in Washington when someone in the media is not reporting on classified information. It\u2019s a part of the ecosystem. In most cases these leaks are considered to be the cost of doing business and a way for the press and Congress to hold the national security state accountable. But the leftwing groups got what they wanted: they\u2019ve managed to create the appearance of wrongdoing on Nunes\u2019 part. \u201cThe Ethics Office wouldn\u2019t be investigating Nunes if there was nothing to investigate!\u201d \u201cNunes wouldn\u2019t recuse himself if he wasn\u2019t guilty!\u201d Even if and when this bogus Ethics probe is dismissed, it will barely be a story. The damage to Nunes\u200a\u2014\u200ahis reputation and his credibility\u200a\u2014\u200aare already done. This is a cheap tactic that I\u2019ve discussed in the past: smear someone with a baseless accusation for the sole reason of getting it into the headlines and associating \u201cethics violation investigation\u201d with Devin Nunes\u2019 name. Because most people don\u2019t actually read the articles, seeing the headline is all that matters. Most people see the headline and move on. This, like the garbage 9th Circuit Court rulings against Trump\u2019s clearly constitutional immigration suspension Executive Order, is the continued politicization of supposedly non-partisan organizations to willfully mislead the public. The courts struck down Trump\u2019s executive order? Wow, it must really be awful and illegal! The courts are honest and nonpartisan! Now that the Congressional Ethics Office is investigating Nunes, it appears yet another apolitical institution is pushing back against the Republicans and their constant scheming, even though in reality it\u2019s dishonest partisan hacks abusing the Ethics Committee to smear their political enemies. Perception is reality. Politics, as with most any highly-visible, high-stakes business in this country, is a PR battle. Both business in a market economy and politics in a democracy are won and lost in the court of public opinion. Even if (and when) Nunes is cleared as totally innocent, this still does irrevocable damage to his reputation and credibility. In recusing himself temporarily, he has allowed his opponents to use underhanded tactics to create the appearance of guilt.
