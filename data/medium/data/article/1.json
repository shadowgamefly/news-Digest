It\u2019s About Class\u00a0Warfare.", "content": "You\u2019ve probably by now seen the video of the doctor who was physically beaten and removed from a United flight because United wanted the seat for its employees. If you haven\u2019t, here it is. Be warned: it\u2019s an incredibly disturbing video: And here\u2019s the story, from Lucas Aulbach at the Courier-Journal: This is a horrifying story, and it\u2019s still unfolding on social media. I\u2019ve noticed something about the reaction to United. People have been making jokes about the incident on Twitter. Which is okay! Jokes are part of the news cycle. They\u2019re how we process things as a culture. And particularly in this case, the jokes are very telling. This one is a perfect example of the tone and tenor of the comedy I\u2019ve been seeing: Then there\u2019s the business world\u2019s response to the news, which is the exact opposite of everyone else\u2019s response to the news: And then the content mines immediately chimed in with their hot-take-clickbait. The most horrifying example of the form is this Yahoo Finance story by Ethan Wolff-Mann, headlined \u201cHow to reduce the chances of getting dragged off your United flight.\u201d An excerpt: So we\u2019ve got the jokes about air travel being a hellish dystopia for anyone not in first class. We\u2019ve got Wall Street cashing in on the metrics while ignoring the human horror of the story. And we\u2019ve got \u201chelpful\u201d news stories explaining that in order to not have this happen to you, it\u2019s wise to exercise some sort of privilege. It should be clear to anyone who\u2019s paying attention that this story is not about customer service. It\u2019s about income inequality. Helaine Olen posted a very good thread on Twitter about this: When you get down to it, like everything else in America today, this is about the haves and the have-nots. If you\u2019re in first class, you don\u2019t need to worry about shock troops coming and beating you until you get out of the seat that you bought. If you\u2019re not in first class, you\u2019re on your own. If you\u2019re in the top one percent on Wall Street, you turn a tidy profit off the whole ordeal. This is what class warfare looks like. I wrote about this topic last month. Visit any department store in America and you\u2019ll see that the corporatization of America has led to a ghastly pursuit for profits over all else. Big Box retailers aren\u2019t interested in providing customer service anymore, they\u2019re interested in profits. This is why shopping at corporate chains has become an awful experience where you have to answer six obnoxious questions about email lists and company credit cards every time you try to check out. You won\u2019t be arrested for refusing to sign up for a Macy\u2019s card, but you will be treated like garbage. Only people who can afford to shop at high-end stores\u200a\u2014\u200aor people lucky enough to live in quality economies like Seattle that support independent retailers\u200a\u2014\u200aget to enjoy real customer service anymore. The situation is heightened on airlines for a couple of reasons. The first, obviously, is the security state that ballooned in size after 9/11. But the other reason is deregulation. Phillip Longman and Lina Khan wrote a great piece for Washington Monthly in 2012 about what trickle-down policies like deregulation have done to the airline experience for non-wealthy passengers: The video that made its way across the internet today is what \u201cgetting worse\u201d looks like. Here\u2019s the thing: when you support trickle-down economic policies that put profits before people, this is what you get. Low-wage jobs, deregulation, and tax cuts for huge corporations result in a culture in which businesses enjoy a tremendous amount of power over ordinary citizens. So what can we do about this? I wish I had easy answers for you, but it\u2019s pretty obvious that an online petition isn\u2019t going to resolve the United situation\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially since Wall Street views it as a net win and is rewarding United for its overbooking situation. No, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to put the power back in the hands of the people. We must support middle-out policies like higher wages for everyone, higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy, and sensible regulations on business. If every American feels like they have a hand in America\u2019s success, we\u2019ll see less tolerance for intolerable actions like what happened on that United flight. Then, when we\u2019ve moved the balance more toward something resembling equity, we can talk about commonsense ideas like breaking up monopolies and penalizing malicious businesses like United for harming Americans who do everything right and play by the rules. Maybe the worst thing about that video is how completely believable it was for anyone who\u2019s flown over the last few years. We\u2019ve all experienced the awfulness of flying, and we recognize it as maybe the most literal manifestation of America\u2019s current class situation: the few sit up front in comfort while the many experience more and more discomfort in the back of the plane. We lose inches of legroom, we\u2019re charged more and more for our carry-ons, and we\u2019re offered less and less in return. This situation isn\u2019t going to get any better until we stand up and demand that things change. This isn\u2019t about one airline\u200a\u2014\u200ahell, it\u2019s not even about air travel. It\u2019s about class in America, and it\u2019s time to demand our fair share. comments Originally published at civicskunkworks.com on April 10, 2017.
