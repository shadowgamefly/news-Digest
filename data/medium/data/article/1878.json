{"name": "1878", "parent": "", "content": "Does China Have an Unfair Competitive Advantage in\u00a0IoT? Here are the folks at research firm Rethink Research discussing Huawei\u2019s warning that this LTE NB-IoT hype is just a little overdone and that the technology for now is mainly for smart meters. The warning about NB-IoT use case limitations is something I\u2019ve mentioned previously, but what caught my eye was some stark differences on pricing. As I mentioned last week, Verizon announced plans to charge $2 per month for its entry level (i.e. smart meter/once per day message) per LTE CAT M1 endpoint in the USA, but this is positively affordable compared to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s NB-IoT pricing of EUR 9.95 per month for each connected machine. (!) I wonder what Verizon and DT customers will think when they learn that China Telecom will charge $0.15 per month per smart meter for its NB-IoT endpoint? Smart meters will only be transmitting incredibly small amounts of data on an operator\u2019s network. Xujianmin suggested that China Telecom will be charging $0.15 per month per smart meter device connection. Now, applying pricing in China to pricing in the U.S. and Germany is not necessarily apples-to-apples, and China may simply be selling NB-IoT services below cost in order to grab market share, stimulate a nascent industry, etc. But global cellular LPWAN markets are all launching at around the same time, have common infrastructure and silicon providers, and\u00a0\u2026 a 1,333% difference between Verizon in the USA and China Mobile in China is kind of shocking, no? A 7,026% difference between Deutsche Telekom and China Mobile is\u00a0\u2026 beyond shocking. So either a) China Mobile is radically selling below cost, b) China Mobile has an amazing unfair cost structure advantage vis-a-vis the rest of the world\u2019s carriers, or c) Verizon and DT finance departments don\u2019t do marketing. Whatever the case, I think cellular IoT pricing is one of its biggest challenges, especially in commercial/industrial markets and China Mobile just highlighted this for the world to see.
