Despite its youth, there are a fair amount of Medium-specific tools out there which you may or may not know about, which is exactly why I wanted to write this article. Already, there are developers who have created awesome platforms, Chrome extensions, apps, and more designed solely for Medium.

I\u2019ve also added my favorite resources and strategies for writing on Medium. Let\u2019s dive in\u2026 Top 3\u00a0Tools #1.) SMedian (formerly known as SuperMeditor) SMedian is a platform to make the lives of Medium writers and editors a hell of a lot easier. It explains how writers can promote themselves and seamlessly request to contribute to their favorite publications. *To learn more about the nuts & bolts of the platform, check out this article here. For editors, SMedian allows you to promote your publication to writers. This platform was developed by Lincoln W Daniel after he experienced the cumbersome tasks associated with being an editor of a Medium publication (you can read more about his inspiration for the tool here). For each email I receive, I have to parse it for the user\u2019s Medium username or ask for it if they failed to provide it. I then have to open a new browser tab to navigate to Medium, find my publication, open the edit page and finally scroll to the bottom to add the user as a writer. I have to do this too many times a week. On top of all of that, I have to deal with my inbox being cluttered by the same types of emails.\u200a\u2014\u200aLincoln W. Daniel, on why he created SMedian. He also is the author of Java for Humans beginner\u2019s book, founder of Marketing & Growth Hacking, and will become an engineer at Medium this upcoming summer. So basically, he\u2019s an all around bad ass and wants to make all of our lives easier on our favorite platform. Lincoln\u2019s vision for SMedian: Lincoln told me he envisions SMedian to live on and provide Medium editors and writers with help to grow and nurture their audiences via additional features in the future. Check out SMedian, and see what you think! #2.) Rabbut &\u00a0Upscribe *Special thanks to Benjamin Foley for telling me about Upscribe. If you aren\u2019t building up your email list on Medium, you\u2019re missing out on one of the most valuable success metrics on the platform. Because there aren\u2019t yet any Buy Now or Install App buttons on Medium, perhaps the best way to gauge interest is through an email signup. As a writer, you could use this metric to quantify real engagement. Real enthusiasm for your material if you have a call to action following your piece. More importantly, as much as we love Medium, no one knows how long any social media platform will survive. Look what happened to Myspace, and Friendster, and Meerkat and Vine and more. Not trying to be a negative Nancy here, but\u2026 One thing that is, more or less, secure though is an email address. You can use email addresses to build up your business for years to come, long after the death of present and future social media platforms. Rabbut and Upscribe provide Medium writers with an easy way to collect email addresses without users having to leave the page of the article. Example of Rabbut form\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a\u00a0picture. Example of Upscribe form \u2014also just a\u00a0picture. For more on Rabbut, check out Kate Chan\u2019s announcement article on Medium here. For more on how to create an Upscribe form, check out this article here. Final Note: Lastly, lucky for all of us, Medium absolutely crushes it in terms of long tail traffic, so you could receive email sign ups months, or even years, after you initially post an article. Final FINAL Note: There is also a method to build email signup forms directly into Medium using Google Forms. One of my favorite Medium writers, Quincy Larson, explains how he did it in this article here. #3.) Top Publications Leaderboard This is a real-time leaderboard for Medium publications based on number of subscribers. What\u2019s great is this tool also provides you with external social links for the publications. If you\u2019re a writer, have your email templates created, canned responses on Gmail enabled, and articles ready to go. Then, use this leaderboard to find your favorite publications and reach out to the editors, either through email or social media. Pumped to see the home team (The Mission) coming in so high!

Let me know what you think of the article and where I can improve! 3 Strategies for writing your next killer Medium\u00a0piece #1.) Use Google Trends & Google\u00a0Alerts Go to Google Trends, and see if any of the trending topics fit the niche you cover in your Medium content. What Google Trends does is give you a pulse on what the world is speaking about outside of Medium. This is how I wrote one of my most popular articles letting the Medium community know the subscription model was coming to the platform (article here).

Medium will never be as real-time as Twitter is (thank God for that). Quality will always reign supreme. However, being first to a topic can provide you with massive leverage over the competition. #2.) Provide a counterargument Always read (or at least check) the Top Stories on Medium. Get an idea of what issues the community is talking about and how they feel about them. After you do that, take a step back. Think critically whether you agree or disagree with the consensus. This worked wonders for me on my Snapchat article after I observed how everyone was talking up Snapchat as if it were the incandescent lamp.

Leverage\u00a0others Tag other writers in your articles. Feature editors, influencers, and industry leaders in your articles. A great example of this is Jessica Guzik\u2019s article covering how Chad Grills built a top Medium publication: How Chad Grills Built a Top Medium Publication \ud83c\udfa7I started a podcast because I wanted to know more about the people in this community: Who they are, why they\u2019re writing\u2026medium.com Pro Tip: I can only speak for myself, but I\u2019ve never NOT recommended an article where my work was quoted or featured.
