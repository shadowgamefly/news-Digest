A Typical Product Backlog Refinement Process Based on the Scrum Guide, a typical process looks as follows: (1) The product owner prioritizes the backlog in advance, so it reflects the best possible use of the development team\u2019s resources: a) The product owner creates and pre-populates the two upcoming sprints with user stories, using the team\u2019s project management software (or a spreadsheet or any other organizational tool the team applies) b) The product owner maintains this pattern continuously. c) The product owner also adds new user stories that he or she may have identified since the previous refinement session. (2) The product owner and the development team are jointly working on user stories: a) The product owner provides the answer to the \u2018why\u2019 question (business purpose), b) The team answers the \u2018how\u2019 question (technical implementation), c) And both collaborate on the \u2018what\u2019 question: what scope is necessary to achieve the desired purpose? (3) The whole team agrees to time-box discussions. A typical time-box per user story would be around five minutes on average per cycle. (4) The product owner provides the acceptance criteria to user stories. (5) The development team defines what is required to consider a user story to be ready for becoming a sprint backlog item. (6) The product owner clarifies questions of the team or invites subject matter experts to refinement sessions who can answer the team\u2019s questions. (7) Consecutive refinement cycles last until each user story meets the definition of ready, or is no longer pursued. (8) Lastly, the team may estimate the available user stories that meet the \u201cdefinition of ready\u201d criteria. The product owner can now choose from those user stories to become part of an upcoming sprint. (Alternatively, you do not estimate.)
