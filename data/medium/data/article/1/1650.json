Shembo just got in trouble for killing his girlfriend\u2019s dog! And the NFL did not treat the abuse of the dog as domestic violence, which is just unbelievable to me. You can google the relationship between the abuse of animals and domestic violence. [Ed note: Shembo killed his former girlfriend\u2019s dog in 2015 and was subsequently waived from the Atlanta Falcons. The NFL announced that he was suspended for two games in the spring, and his appeal was denied last month. Shembo is not currently with a NFL team, though he is actively pursuing another chance. He recently told ESPN, \u201cI thank Jesus Christ for what I went through because it truly opened my eyes. I was able to grow.\u201d] I don\u2019t even know what to say. It makes me really frustrated, because we\u2019re all saying we\u2019re making progress, but look at where we are. I mean, any system built around punishment is always going to be bad, and it\u2019s always going to feel unfair, which is why it\u2019s so important to address the root cause. \u201cI mean, any system built around punishment is always going to be bad, and it\u2019s always going to feel unfair, which is why it\u2019s so important to address the root\u00a0cause.\u201d In your book, you lay out some very clear ways to tackle this and move forward. And you do a great job of addressing it from all different angles\u200a\u2014\u200ateams, coaches, media, NCAA, we all have to have accountability. But the problem is, everyone is passing the buck. The media takes the cues from the coaches who take the cues from the NCAA which takes the cues from the media. So few people are stepping up and saying, \u2018hey, this is really hard but we can at least do something.\u2019 Which is why my favorite chapter title of yours is, \u2018Do Anything.\u2019 Right, which is why when Baylor did something it felt so huge\u200a\u2014\u200athey did a thing! The ripples of that, who knows, it might be nothing outside of Waco. But I often feel that way. Anyone, do something. Which is why I do this work even though it\u2019s exhausting, because someone has to disrupt. I\u2019m not popular for it all the time, but I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll be that person who yells at my colleagues in the media about how they talk about this stuff. Do anything, yes. Someone do something. We just need more disruption within the system. Baylor was a disruption. It was something and I hold onto those moments really hard.
