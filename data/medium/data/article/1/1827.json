It occurs to me that the systems we build our lives around\u200a\u2014\u200afood, housing, energy, education and the likes\u200a\u2014\u200aare a representation of the deeply held attitudes and beliefs of previous generations, which are gently being shaped by our own work in this lifetime.

Essentially I\u2019m proffering that I believe we must fit the change strategy to the needs of the change\u00a0we\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0see, rather than always relying on deep personal change as the means to shift all\u00a0systems. I really appreciated this piece of work by rachel sinha & Tim Draimin on Systems Change as an emerging field. In our work with Lifehack, we often held the tension between the inner work we observed (and personally experienced) is necessary for systems change, with the need for tangible, visible, manifestations of this work in the world, which would begin to create ripples or even tectonic shifts in the systems we were working on. It feels like there\u2019s an important opportunity for the inner work to grow, morph and mature in the context of these manifestations (\u201couter work\u201d if you will).
