Here are the knobs that I adjusted. 10 Things I Had to Give Up to Heal My\u00a0Anxiety 1. Friends \u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMark Twain I\u2019m often asked by readers, what is the most important aspect to focus on to alleviate my anxiety? My answer is always the same: Relationships. I\u2019m not positive if you become the average of the five people you spend the most time with, but I am confident that if your lifestyle does not add to your healing, it will subtract from it. For me, the people I was spending my time with were not conducive to my healing. Not that I don\u2019t love my friends, I do. But they were not on the same path I was, and I needed to eject myself to heal myself. So I went to the extreme and moved to an entirely different city where I knew almost no one. I spent the first 90 days there focusing solely on myself and my growth. Now that may sound selfish or insincere, but if I had never made that leap, I would not be sitting here writing this article. I thoroughly believe that success in life, however you define it, is the result of how many tough conversations you are willing to have. There is no harder discussion than telling a friend or a group of friends that you no longer want to have a relationship with them. But, at the same time, there may not be anything more important in life than being true to yourself and finding your tribe. You may hate this answer. You may think I am a dick for saying it. Or you may say that you could never leave \u201cyour boys.\u201d And my response is this, how much is your life worth? It is okay to act selfishly in the short term for long term health and well-being. Don\u2019t be cynical but understand that no one else is going to take care of you. You need to take care of yourself. Stop thinking about what you have \u201cinvested.\u201d Relationships are essential to your growth and healing. Leaving one, whether intimate or not, is hard. You will feel bad. But understand that you are making this decision in the short-term for your long-term health. Later on, after you healed yourself, reassess the relationships by slowly dipping yourself back into them. But you will often find that when you step away for a bit and focus on developing relationships with people that more closely align with your value, you will not miss the old way of life. Have the hard conversations. 2. Alcohol \u201cA wise man will be master of his mind, A fool will be its slave\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aPublilius Syrus Alcohol is not inherently dangerous, and I have reintroduced it back into my life, albeit at a much smaller volume, but if you want to take back control of your life, it is not helping you.

At the very least, you may lose some weight! \ud83d\ude42 3. News I didn\u2019t vote. There, I admitted it. I get it. I get it. It\u2019s my civic duty, blah blah blah. I get it. It\u2019s my civic duty, blah blah blah. But to me, healing my anxiety and personal growth was more important than following the buffoonery that was the news of 2016. I first gave it up in January when I realized that it was the primary trigger for my catastrophizing of events, and found it so helpful that I never picked it back up. I am not ignorant of events, although I think we all would be happier if we hid under rocks last year. I was just committed to healing, and the news was a detriment, specifically digital media that thrives on the raunchy and terrifying to drive clicks. Instead, I focused on what Jeff Bezos calls the things that don\u2019t change. Taking the time to read about the men and women who have changed the world throughout past centuries. Timeless books that are just as true now as they were when they were published. \u201cBreaking news\u201d should be something you curate, not something controlled by a 24-year-old sitting in a cubicle. Be diligent. 4. Scarcity\u00a0Mindset \u201cThe greater danger for most of us in not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we hit it.\u201d Aristotle One of the biggest anchors keeping me from growth was how I viewed the world. I thought everything was scarce. If I left my job, I would never find a new one, I thought. Or if I spent $1,000 on a personal development seminar, it was cash lost without a return. However, to heal, I had to change to an abundant mindset. I had to view the world as a beautiful place that was overflowing with goodness, rather than one in which I had to hold my chips close to my chest for fear that they were the only ones I would ever be given. Not only did this drastically help me take the steps necessary to healing my anxiety, but it has also led to exponential clarity in every facet of my life. Start looking at what life has already given you. Not what you don\u2019t have. For it is only when you make this change of mind that your cup will start overflowing with abundance. 5. Social\u00a0Media Oh, the highlight reel. I\u2019ll keep this brief if you are someone who is always comparing yourself to others, delete your fucking social media accounts. You will not be left in the stone age. You will not lose contact with your friends. And you will not miss out. Think long and hard about what matters. I promise you social media does NOT. 6. Single Pursuit of\u00a0Money \u201cIf you say that money is the most important thing, you\u2019ll spend your life completely wasting your time: You\u2019ll be doing things you don\u2019t like doing in order to go on living, that is, in order to go on doing things you don\u2019t like doing\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is stupid!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAlan Watts At the end of 2015, I had a decision to make.

This decision was hard because it went against everything I have to believe since taking my first finance class at University. But, I needed change. I needed to get uncomfortable. And most importantly, I needed to start making decisions that were not rooted in money. Where in your life are you hesitating because of a fear of not being \u201csuccessful?\u201d 7. Television If you\u2019re just starting out as a writer, you could do worse than strip your television\u2019s electric plug-wire, wrap a spike around it, and then stick it back into the wall. See what blows, and how far. Just an idea.\u200a\u2014\u200aStephen King Another confession, I haven\u2019t had a tv for 15 months. What first started out of circumstance with my move to New York, carried on as an intentional way to live my life. When you have a tv, whether you mindfully are watching it or not, it will be the perfect filler for dead space. For me, I wanted to cultivate this dead space in my life. When people ask how I read 80+ books in the last 15 months, I tell them, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. Pull the television cord out of your wall and throw the damn thing away.\u201d Similar to social media, television is not helping you live a better life. I promise you. If you love movies, then make the intentional step to actually (hold your breath) go to the movie theater. That way you are mindful about it. The lack of a tv has been the biggest life hack I have found thus far. 8. What Others Thought of\u00a0Me \u201cA man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHenry David Thoreau As someone who struggled with anxiety, I cared far too much about what other people thought about me. I won\u2019t go into much detail, but I will say this\u2026 Fuck them. Fuck their opinions. Fuck their validation. Fuck it so hard that it swings around and kicks your ass further toward the life you want. Caring about what others think about you, or your work, is the single greatest deterrent from living the life you want. It is a lifelong battle, but start it now, so you don\u2019t wake up at 50 in a house in the suburbs, confused how you got there, realizing that someone else\u2019s opinion dictated your every decision. I took the advice of Brene Brown to heart by writing down a short list of people that I care what they think about my work. Some are in the creative arena, trying to build something out of nothing, and some of them are close friends. But none of them are critics vying for me to see the world \u201ctheir way.\u201d Do the same. Create a short list of the people whose opinions matter. And forget the rest. 9. Self-Labeling \u201cA man is what he constantly thinks about all day\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRalph Waldo Emerson The day I stopped labeling myself as an \u201canxious person\u201d my healing took a new trajectory. I hear it all the time from readers and individuals in the mental health world. They love labels. They are always creating new ones. The other day a mother reached out to me asking for advice. She told me her son was diagnosed with \u201csensitive child syndrome.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think to myself, are you fucking kidding me? That\u2019s why your child is struggling. He doesn\u2019t have a chance if you are always labeling him with terms that are not only getting more absurd but are completely debilitating. Now, I understand that it is important, medically, to diagnose patients. But at what costs and lengths must we go? My thing is, who cares, what you are. Does having some label make you better? Does it help you heal yourself faster? Labels, in my opinion, are making you worse, not better. They put you in the victim mentality from where it is next to impossible to heal yourself. Stop labeling yourself and start putting your energy into finding a solution. Yes, I am telling you to fool yourself. How else do you think growth happens? 10. 80% of My\u00a0Things \u201cThe things you own, end up owning you.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aTyler Durden in Fight Club When I made the decision to move to New York, I threw out 80% of what I owned, and I could not be happier. Material possessions, in my opinion, are weights that will hold you back from taking risks. They will slow your decision to move to a new city, leave a job, or start a business. I didn\u2019t want that. I wanted to be nimble, able to make decisions without having to think about what I owned. I pursued learning and experiences, and they have brought me 10x the benefits. Decrease to\u00a0Increase Now, I don\u2019t believe that you need to give up everything that I did. The list above is just what I had to decrease to increase my life. Your list will be different. It is far easier to try to add things to your life continuously, and much harder to radically delve into the dirt of life to find the weeds. But unless you find the weeds and eradicate them from your life, you will never have sustained healing. I urge you to practice what Jerry Colonna calls \u201cradical self-inquiry,\u201d searching for the dark areas within, leaving no stone unturned, to finally heal yourself. It will be hard. It will be worth it. Go Deeper Are you ready to wake up, get more focused, and find more happiness in your life? If so, sign up for my free 21 Day Mindfulness Email Course.
