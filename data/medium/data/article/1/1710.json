Those celebrities? Surgery, mostly. And genetics: just like the industry tries to find those few people who are just genetically prone to being thin, the celebrity-fitness complex focuses on the exceptions. And, oh.

Your genetics/body determines where the fat comes from."}, {"9121": "All this lack of interest by the fitness industry on effective strength training is doubly ironic because besides the enormous health and fitness benefits for keeping up your muscles, no matter your weight, muscle is metabolically active. The amount of muscle you have determines how many calories your body burns throughout the day, even as you sit. Loss of muscle as we age (natural part of aging for both men and women) is one key reason we gain weight as we age, a concern that pushes many to exercise, but without strength-training\u2014you see the irony. The more muscle you have, the more calories your body burns at all times, while an activity like running even a whole hour, not an easy feat, can be offset by eating a sandwich and an apple. And active people tend to get hungry, naturally, and add those extra calories to their diet. Besides, caloric restriction dieting (especially if it\u2019s severe and without exercise) often results in muscle loss, which makes people even more likely to gain weight once they stop their diet, as their body now has proportionally more fat and less muscle compared to before the diet. They\u2019ll now gain weight on even fewer calories per day, leading to further frustration and cycles of yo-yo dieting and weight gain."}, {"e5a2": "SO, WORK YOUR\u00a0MUSCLES"}, {"7af4": "Strength training exercises have a few basic principles."}, {"181f": "First, you must stress your muscles, meaning that it doesn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t push yourself a little. Your body is honed to conserve energy, convincing it to keep building muscles requires giving it a good reason, i.e. a bit of stress. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with that 2 lbs dumbbell. If a weight becomes too easy because you've grown strong, increase it a little. Once that\u2019s easy, too, increase that. That principle underlies all strength training."}, {"2eec": "Second, you must allow for time to rest, so don\u2019t do strength training on the same muscle two days in a row. Rest is when your body decides to and can build up the muscle you stressed. The exercise is the signal, the rest is when the real work is done."}, {"f55c": "Third, exercise all your muscle groups, in turn. You can use dumbbells, whole body exercises (great), strength training elastics. The principle is the same."}, {"f29f": "You need to learn the names of the main muscles, and which exercises use which. (Here, this two pager has most of what you need). You can train for as little as two days of the week (say, back, triceps, trap and hamstrings one day, and chest, biceps and quadriceps the other day, and abs on both). You can train four days of the week (with rest days in between) or any combination. It usually takes 20\u201330 minutes each time, so you are looking at 20 minutes twice a week at a minimum. Remember, always take rest days, that\u2019s when your body takes the chance to build that muscle, which is your goal."}, {"d446": "There are some good guidelines out there. Here\u2019s a one. Here\u2019s another. This isn\u2019t bad either. Remember, ignore the unrealistic pictures. You won\u2019t and almost certainly cannot look \u201cripped.\u201d But you are best off learning the principle: look at that guide of major muscles, and make sure you exercise all of them, once or twice a week, with weights that challenge but not overwhelm you."}, {"2cc4": "If you are using dumbbells, here\u2019s your rule of thumb: Pick a weight you can comfortably lift 12 times, rest a few minutes, lift for another 10\u201312 times, rest a few minutes more, but can barely lift 8 more the last time (called a set). You\u2019ll have done three sets, and you are done with that muscle. If you go too easy your first try, increase it the next time. If you start too heavy, decrease it a bit. Err on the side of caution."}, {"5942": "You can apply the same rule of thumb if you are using whole body exercises (like pushups, squats and pullups). First, do a number (probably around 5\u201310) that leaves you tired, but not exhausted. Repeat. If you got it right, by the third set, you should be really feeling spent, but not miserable. Stop when you can\u2019t do anymore. Remember, if you feel miserable, you\u2019ve overdone it. You\u2019ll find your sweet spot quickly, and you\u2019ll soon learn to know what your body can do, and what feels right. When in doubt, stop. Don\u2019t overdo it. You can try again later."}, {"3191": "The first few weeks of weight-lifting will be accompanied by a soreness that starts a day or two late\u2014it\u2019s called delayed onset muscle soreness. It should feel like soreness, not serious pain. This is very common. It\u2019s okay. It won\u2019t always be that way. It\u2019s a normal part of starting weight-training from scratch."}, {"4ea9": "If you read online guides, remember ignore the parts about looks, weight, \u201ctoning\u201d and various admonitions. You need to lift weights because stronger muscles are going to make you healthy, less prone to injury and more fit."}, {"9d22": "GET YOURSELF HUFFING AND\u00a0PUFFING"}, {"925d": "I have even less to say about aerobic exercise, the part that conditions your cardiovascular system. What we know is exceedingly straightforward (except how to get people to do it). Every study finds more benefits. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do as long as you are left somewhat breathless, but not too much. You can run, bike, walk briskly (not leisurely). You can dance, hop, skip and jump. You can swim or spin. If you go to an exercise class, remember, almost all the dancing choreography is to keep you interested and somewhat distracted; it is not the part that\u2019s benefiting your health. If you just want to jump up and down, while the rest of the class twirls to a modified samba step, that works, too. Just move."}, {"9638": "How long? I\u2019ll be straight. Like most things, most of the benefits are in the initial ramp-up, not the margins. If you are sedentary, just doing some cardio, even 30 minutes a week, 10 minutes at a time, will get you some real benefits. If I were doing bare bones, I\u2019d say try 20 minutes at a time, three times a week. That\u2019s just one hour the whole week. Research observes real benefits even to that little. But don\u2019t stop there: the research also strongly suggests that you should try to do about 150 minutes per week, or 30 minutes, per day, for at least five days of the week. That\u2019s two-and-a-half hours per week."}, {"9dc5": "By the way, if you have a desire to lose weight, research shows that people who've lost weight and kept it off long-term through non-surgical means, have mostly done it primarily through (drastically) lower caloric intake plus about an hour of exercise per day, everyday. Research also shows more weight-loss benefits to strength-training than aerobic exercise. But that\u2019s a whole other issue: remember, exercise is for health."}, {"b900": "How little at a time? 10 minutes seems to be the absolute minimum that starts accruing benefits. So if you can do 10 minutes every day, do it. You\u2019ll benefit. But if you can, increase it."}, {"93d7": "How hard? There are heartbeat calculators and formulas out there, but here\u2019s your rule-of-thumb: You should be huffing and puffing a bit, but able to talk. If you are so out of breath that you can\u2019t talk, slow down, and then gradually stop. Catch your breath. If you can hold a conversation with no huffing and puffing, it\u2019s too easy: step it up."}, {"9afc": "If you can, throw small spikes into your exercise. These are called intervals. While walking briskly, for example, break into a jog for 20\u201330 seconds, and start walking again. Do it 2\u20133 times in your whole routine. Research shows that intervals help fitness benefits. But don\u2019t worry about it. This is optional. You don\u2019t need to read 30 articles on the best interval method. You don\u2019t even need to do them if you don\u2019t feel like it."}, {"52b4": "There is one last trick, one that actually works, in this field of a million tricks which don\u2019t work. You can combine your strength and aerobic exercises, by doing your strength-training at a brisk pace, hence keeping your heart-rate up, for the whole 20\u201330 minutes in which you are stressing your muscles. This exercise routine by Jillian Michaels, available seemingly legally on Youtube in both introductory and intermediate forms, is very good in that it does really cover most major muscle groups, and is done briskly enough to be good for both cardio and strength. Ignore its name: just this won\u2019t make you \u201cshred.\u201d I\u2019ve heard that she later became a TV star with a show that\u2019s focused on losing weight, which I\u2019ve never watched and I actually find the idea somewhat disturbing, but the routine is good and she is mostly telling the truth throughout the video which is a rare thing in this industry."}, {"d370": "If you were crunched for time, you could get a lot out of doing the beginning version of that particular routine, and pushing yourself progressively harder, just 3\u20134 times a week, moving up to the intermediary version, and maybe a brisk walk or two here and there for 10\u201320 minutes. By the time you are too fit for the intermediate version, you will have learned a lot about your body, and how to push yourself appropriately."}, {"4be4": "So, here it is: Build your muscles by stressing them, but don\u2019t forget to rest. Get your heart rate up at least a few times a week, for about 20 minutes at a\u00a0time."}, {"21d9": "That\u2019s, umm,\u00a0it."}, {"5cff": "Most important part of this is that you will find your own groove, and your activity, as long as it fits the above broad outline.

In fact, I\u2019m, ahem, lousy at most. I\u2019ve always been fortunate enough to find people who enjoyed the sport and friendly competition, not aggressive one-upmanship). At the moment, I have a time-intensive job which involves a lot of writing, so I\u2019ve found other ways to incorporate exercise into my day. Most months, I lift weights. Sometimes, I do whole body exercises. I switch routines as I get bored. I own an elliptical that I bought for $400 about 10 years ago and use almost every week, and I\u2019ve recently acquired a treadmill desk. I\u2019ve packed away my television, and the only time I watch a screen for leisure is on the elliptical, which motivates me to get on it.

I don\u2019t have an answer for what will work for you, but I encourage you to find something you enjoy. Swim with a waterproof music player, and make it your time to listen to music you miss.

Very few of us consider strength-training as essential exercise, but it is. It is especially crucial as one ages, because a natural part of the aging process is losing muscle. Women, especially, need to lift weights, and the trick to lifting weights is stressing muscles. And that weight has to be a real weight, progressively increased, and barring health issues, an average woman should not even bother with two pound weights because that won\u2019t stress your muscles enough to benefit you. Exercise industry is surely partially to blame for why people don\u2019t exercise regularly: they promise the wrong thing (weight loss) and then don\u2019t push/guide people to do the right thing. I encountered those pink, useless dumbbells when I joined commercial exercise classes, attempting to recover from an ankle injury, and seeking some novelty. Classes can be fun, and group exercise isn\u2019t a bad option. I thought, after lifelong avoidance of the industry, I might as well give it a shot. A young woman had come to class with her toddler, and she exercised in the back room set aside for kids, participating through the half-open door. When we switched to strength-training, she strolled out of the room, her toddler under one arm, and walked to the weight rack, and picked the two-pounders, turned around. Her toddler, held under one arm, was at least 25 pounds. But it\u2019s hard to blame her. The weights in the class were mostly under five pounds. I was actually out of shape, due to my ankle injury. These were women who exercised regularly in this class that ostensibly included strength training. Some had been attending for years. Yet, there were only two dumbbells over seven pounds, and a single set of ten pounders. I asked around why the weights were so puny, and was told that \u201cthey wanted to tone, not bulk.\u201d Lies the fitness industry tells women. The dumbbells available at a local, popular fitness club for\u00a0women. Hahahahahahahaha, would say my gym friends, actual athletes, which included a few women who actually tried to bulk up. It\u2019s very hard for women to \u201cbulk up\u201d. An average woman is not going to accidentally \u201cbulk up\u201d. Women also have naturally higher body fat percentage\u2014even if they \u201cbulked up\u201d in muscle, it would take an enormous amount of effort, and let\u2019s be honest, likely some shady medical \u201cenhancements\u201d, before an average woman ended up with noticeable musculature plus lose enough body fat for the muscles to show through.

Part of the emphasis on abs, it seems, comes from the pregnancy and \u201cpost-baby body\u201d industry that urges women to try to look like they never got pregnant. It\u2019s a whole other ugly lie, bolstered by pictures of celebrities in their \u201cpost baby body\u201d pics, and hides this truth: for most women, it is virtually impossible to \u201cexercise\u201d your way back to a pre-pregnancy body. Those celebrities? Surgery, mostly. And genetics: just like the industry tries to find those few people who are just genetically prone to being thin, the celebrity-fitness complex focuses on the exceptions. And, oh. The muscles you exercise (abs) and where you lose fat (tummy, etc.) are not related. Muscles are muscles, and fat is fat. Your genetics/body determines where the fat comes from. All this lack of interest by the fitness industry on effective strength training is doubly ironic because besides the enormous health and fitness benefits for keeping up your muscles, no matter your weight, muscle is metabolically active. The amount of muscle you have determines how many calories your body burns throughout the day, even as you sit. Loss of muscle as we age (natural part of aging for both men and women) is one key reason we gain weight as we age, a concern that pushes many to exercise, but without strength-training\u2014you see the irony. The more muscle you have, the more calories your body burns at all times, while an activity like running even a whole hour, not an easy feat, can be offset by eating a sandwich and an apple. And active people tend to get hungry, naturally, and add those extra calories to their diet. Besides, caloric restriction dieting (especially if it\u2019s severe and without exercise) often results in muscle loss, which makes people even more likely to gain weight once they stop their diet, as their body now has proportionally more fat and less muscle compared to before the diet. They\u2019ll now gain weight on even fewer calories per day, leading to further frustration and cycles of yo-yo dieting and weight gain. SO, WORK YOUR\u00a0MUSCLES Strength training exercises have a few basic principles. First, you must stress your muscles, meaning that it doesn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t push yourself a little. Your body is honed to conserve energy, convincing it to keep building muscles requires giving it a good reason, i.e. a bit of stress. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with that 2 lbs dumbbell. If a weight becomes too easy because you've grown strong, increase it a little. Once that\u2019s easy, too, increase that. That principle underlies all strength training. Second, you must allow for time to rest, so don\u2019t do strength training on the same muscle two days in a row. Rest is when your body decides to and can build up the muscle you stressed. The exercise is the signal, the rest is when the real work is done. Third, exercise all your muscle groups, in turn. You can use dumbbells, whole body exercises (great), strength training elastics. The principle is the same. You need to learn the names of the main muscles, and which exercises use which. (Here, this two pager has most of what you need). You can train for as little as two days of the week (say, back, triceps, trap and hamstrings one day, and chest, biceps and quadriceps the other day, and abs on both). You can train four days of the week (with rest days in between) or any combination. It usually takes 20\u201330 minutes each time, so you are looking at 20 minutes twice a week at a minimum. Remember, always take rest days, that\u2019s when your body takes the chance to build that muscle, which is your goal. There are some good guidelines out there. Here\u2019s a one. Here\u2019s another. This isn\u2019t bad either. Remember, ignore the unrealistic pictures. You won\u2019t and almost certainly cannot look \u201cripped.\u201d But you are best off learning the principle: look at that guide of major muscles, and make sure you exercise all of them, once or twice a week, with weights that challenge but not overwhelm you. If you are using dumbbells, here\u2019s your rule of thumb: Pick a weight you can comfortably lift 12 times, rest a few minutes, lift for another 10\u201312 times, rest a few minutes more, but can barely lift 8 more the last time (called a set). You\u2019ll have done three sets, and you are done with that muscle. If you go too easy your first try, increase it the next time. If you start too heavy, decrease it a bit. Err on the side of caution. You can apply the same rule of thumb if you are using whole body exercises (like pushups, squats and pullups). First, do a number (probably around 5\u201310) that leaves you tired, but not exhausted. Repeat. If you got it right, by the third set, you should be really feeling spent, but not miserable. Stop when you can\u2019t do anymore. Remember, if you feel miserable, you\u2019ve overdone it. You\u2019ll find your sweet spot quickly, and you\u2019ll soon learn to know what your body can do, and what feels right. When in doubt, stop. Don\u2019t overdo it. You can try again later. The first few weeks of weight-lifting will be accompanied by a soreness that starts a day or two late\u2014it\u2019s called delayed onset muscle soreness. It should feel like soreness, not serious pain. This is very common. It\u2019s okay. It won\u2019t always be that way. It\u2019s a normal part of starting weight-training from scratch. If you read online guides, remember ignore the parts about looks, weight, \u201ctoning\u201d and various admonitions. You need to lift weights because stronger muscles are going to make you healthy, less prone to injury and more fit. GET YOURSELF HUFFING AND\u00a0PUFFING I have even less to say about aerobic exercise, the part that conditions your cardiovascular system. What we know is exceedingly straightforward (except how to get people to do it). Every study finds more benefits. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do as long as you are left somewhat breathless, but not too much. You can run, bike, walk briskly (not leisurely). You can dance, hop, skip and jump. You can swim or spin. If you go to an exercise class, remember, almost all the dancing choreography is to keep you interested and somewhat distracted; it is not the part that\u2019s benefiting your health. If you just want to jump up and down, while the rest of the class twirls to a modified samba step, that works, too. Just move. How long? I\u2019ll be straight. Like most things, most of the benefits are in the initial ramp-up, not the margins. If you are sedentary, just doing some cardio, even 30 minutes a week, 10 minutes at a time, will get you some real benefits. If I were doing bare bones, I\u2019d say try 20 minutes at a time, three times a week. That\u2019s just one hour the whole week. Research observes real benefits even to that little. But don\u2019t stop there: the research also strongly suggests that you should try to do about 150 minutes per week, or 30 minutes, per day, for at least five days of the week. That\u2019s two-and-a-half hours per week. By the way, if you have a desire to lose weight, research shows that people who've lost weight and kept it off long-term through non-surgical means, have mostly done it primarily through (drastically) lower caloric intake plus about an hour of exercise per day, everyday. Research also shows more weight-loss benefits to strength-training than aerobic exercise. But that\u2019s a whole other issue: remember, exercise is for health. How little at a time? 10 minutes seems to be the absolute minimum that starts accruing benefits. So if you can do 10 minutes every day, do it. You\u2019ll benefit. But if you can, increase it. How hard? There are heartbeat calculators and formulas out there, but here\u2019s your rule-of-thumb: You should be huffing and puffing a bit, but able to talk. If you are so out of breath that you can\u2019t talk, slow down, and then gradually stop. Catch your breath. If you can hold a conversation with no huffing and puffing, it\u2019s too easy: step it up. If you can, throw small spikes into your exercise. These are called intervals. While walking briskly, for example, break into a jog for 20\u201330 seconds, and start walking again. Do it 2\u20133 times in your whole routine. Research shows that intervals help fitness benefits. But don\u2019t worry about it. This is optional. You don\u2019t need to read 30 articles on the best interval method. You don\u2019t even need to do them if you don\u2019t feel like it. There is one last trick, one that actually works, in this field of a million tricks which don\u2019t work. You can combine your strength and aerobic exercises, by doing your strength-training at a brisk pace, hence keeping your heart-rate up, for the whole 20\u201330 minutes in which you are stressing your muscles. This exercise routine by Jillian Michaels, available seemingly legally on Youtube in both introductory and intermediate forms, is very good in that it does really cover most major muscle groups, and is done briskly enough to be good for both cardio and strength. Ignore its name: just this won\u2019t make you \u201cshred.\u201d I\u2019ve heard that she later became a TV star with a show that\u2019s focused on losing weight, which I\u2019ve never watched and I actually find the idea somewhat disturbing, but the routine is good and she is mostly telling the truth throughout the video which is a rare thing in this industry. If you were crunched for time, you could get a lot out of doing the beginning version of that particular routine, and pushing yourself progressively harder, just 3\u20134 times a week, moving up to the intermediary version, and maybe a brisk walk or two here and there for 10\u201320 minutes. By the time you are too fit for the intermediate version, you will have learned a lot about your body, and how to push yourself appropriately. So, here it is: Build your muscles by stressing them, but don\u2019t forget to rest. Get your heart rate up at least a few times a week, for about 20 minutes at a\u00a0time. That\u2019s, umm,\u00a0it. Most important part of this is that you will find your own groove, and your activity, as long as it fits the above broad outline. Over time, I have gotten aerobic exercise through a variety of means, including the thai-boxing ring, biking, running and basketball when I was younger (I\u2019m not good at any of those! In fact, I\u2019m, ahem, lousy at most. I\u2019ve always been fortunate enough to find people who enjoyed the sport and friendly competition, not aggressive one-upmanship). At the moment, I have a time-intensive job which involves a lot of writing, so I\u2019ve found other ways to incorporate exercise into my day. Most months, I lift weights. Sometimes, I do whole body exercises. I switch routines as I get bored. I own an elliptical that I bought for $400 about 10 years ago and use almost every week, and I\u2019ve recently acquired a treadmill desk. I\u2019ve packed away my television, and the only time I watch a screen for leisure is on the elliptical, which motivates me to get on it. I think better when I walk, so the treadmill desk helps with that while getting the brisk walking in. But this is me. I don\u2019t have an answer for what will work for you, but I encourage you to find something you enjoy. Swim with a waterproof music player, and make it your time to listen to music you miss. Go for a brisk walk with a buddy, and chat. Dance for 20 minutes. Take a class, and don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t do all the complicated moves. Just move, briskly, 20\u201330 minutes at a time. Lift weights, or do whole bodyweight moves a few times a week. Listen to podcasts or audiobooks. Tune out and just focus on the exercise. Whatever works for you, and your body, and your motivation. That\u2019s it. There is, surely, a lot more to learn about fitness, exercise and health but those two bolded sentences above are the core basics, and that\u2019s where most of the benefits are. All the fads, promises, tricks are confusing and misleading. The intense focus on weight-loss and exercise, especially for women, is doubly misleading and harmful because everyone benefits from exercise while weight-loss is fraught, complicated and frustrating. Exercise because exercise. Don\u2019t listen to the exercise industry, don\u2019t look at the ads, and don\u2019t read articles that spend a lot of time on the latest thing or trick. Forget the resolutions. Forget the fads. Lift. Move. Regularly. That\u2019s it. You can do it. Go. "}
