I verified that they at least exercise once a week before starting the usability test. In the end, I tested the tasks with five individuals. Here is a breakdown of their familiarity with fitness trackers. Identifying and Prioritising Pain\u00a0Points The next day I reviewed the recordings of the tests and jotted down each user\u2019s pain point onto a Post-It. Then I used affinity mapping to group the pain points into similar categories on a whiteboard. Affinity mapping pain points on whiteboard, each colour represents a\u00a0user Then I prioritised each pain point based on its importance to the user as well as its importance to Fitbit. My assumptions of the importance to users were based on conversations with the existing and potential users. My assumptions of the importance to Fitbit were based on my analysis of their website and marketing materials. Tracking, logging and editing the exercise were core functions of the product and challenging a friend was a core feature that made Fitbit stand out as a social fitness app. Prioritising pain points on a 2x2\u00a0matrix Defining the\u00a0Problem I decided to tackle the four pain points that were both important to users and Fitbit. I redefined the pain points below. Pain Point 1: Discoverability issue with tracking and logging exercise There are two entry points to track or log an exercise on the app: through a floating action button on the dashboard page and through the exercise page, but both entry points have discoverability issues. Pain Point 2: Users had difficulty finding the relevant exercise type to log Fitbit has a large database of over 100 exercises that users can use to log exercise (and only 19 exercises available for tracking). But the app does not show a list of all exercises (presumably because such a long list may be overwhelming).

The user could not find any matching result by searching \u201cchest\u201d, \u201cworkout\u201d, \u201carms\u201d or \u201cgym\u201d. The most relevant exercise type on the database is weights but this is unknown to the user. Pain Point 3: Users could not edit exercise records apart from exercise type There are four different ways to record an exercise onto the Fitbit app. I did some further research by visiting Fitbit\u2019s online customer service forum and conducting user interviews to learn more about how an exercise can be recorded. User interviews revealed that keeping a (roughly) accurate record of exercises is important for a user to motivate her to achieve her fitness goal. Currently, a user can only change the exercise type after an exercise is recorded. The ability to edit the starting time and duration of exercise is equally important because a user may forget to start or stop recording on time and the auto-detection on the tracker, although helpful, is not always accurate. This leads to either an exaggerated or inflated exercise time which could be discouraging and frustrating to the user. Pain Point 4: Users had trouble finding how to challenge a friend Creating a challenge with friends is one of the standout features that made Fitbit so socially popular when it launched. Currently, to create a challenge, a user has to go to the Challenges tab, select a challenge, then pick friend(s) to compete with. In the usability test, 3 out of 5 users tried to look for how to create a challenge on a friend\u2019s page and were frustrated when they couldn\u2019t find a way.

Task Flow I also created a task flow to show the flow for a user who wants to accurately record her exercise on the Fitbit app. The highlighted areas represent the first 3 pain points which I will tackle in my design solutions. Ideating the\u00a0Solution Then it was time to start sketching. I came up with several potential solutions to each of the pain points and made some rough UI sketches. I did some preliminary validation on the Lo-Fi UI sketches and used the feedback to refine my sketches and narrow down my solutions for the Hi-Fi mockups. Prototyping and Validation I jumped into Sketch to create Hi-Fi mockups of my proposed solutions and used Marvel to create a clickable prototype. I tested the prototype with 5 new individuals. Insights from the validation test led me to reiterate on one of the screens. Below are the Hi-Fi mockups of my final solutions including the results of the user testing before and after implementing my design solutions. Pain Point 1: Discoverability issue with tracking and logging exercise on Fitbit app Design solution: Make the two entry points on the dashboard and exercise page more easily discoverable and make the choice between track and log exercise more apparent. Pain Point 2: Users had difficulty finding the correct exercise type to log Design solution: Add a way for users to browse all exercise types. Pain Point 3: Users could not edit exercise records apart from exercise type Design solution: Allow the user to be able to edit starting time and duration of an exercise. Pain Point 4: Users had trouble finding how to challenge a friend Design solution: Allow a user to challenge a friend on the friend\u2019s page. Here\u2019s an overview of the results of my design changes. You can also check out my prototype here. Takeaways Fitbit is a great product with a grand mission to get people moving.
