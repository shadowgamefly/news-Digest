Redick, and the Blue Devils downed his Musketeers in the waning moments. In 2007, Matta\u2019s Buckeyes lost to Florida in the national championship, a game that he considers the biggest regret in his career, specifically because of his decision to bench Conley in the first half because of foul trouble instead of trusting his freshman point guard.

But Matta sees something special in his returning core of JaQuan Lyle, Marc Loving, Keita Bates-Diop, Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Trevor Thompson, and Kam Williams\u200a\u2014\u200aa group that he believes ran into problems last year because of inexperience more than lack of talent. He also says the newcomers to the program \u201cfit the puzzle better than the pieces that we lost last year.\u201d Most notable among them: freshman Micah Potter, a 6-foot-9 ball of energy who figures to be the first true stretch 4 Matta has ever coached and whose potential has those around the team foaming at the mouth. Ohio State has just one senior on its roster (Loving), and for a coach who finds fulfillment in watching guys develop, that youth is a godsend. Bringing back his top six players also has Matta feeling optimistic, especially since he says he is \u201cgoing back to 2004 and coaching and running this program the way I did back then.\u201d His focus is squarely on reestablishing an Ohio State basketball brand in which pride, chemistry, and toughness are paramount, not on appeasing the growing number of Buckeyes fans who are frustrated that the winningest coach in school history isn\u2019t winning as much as they think he should. The value of not giving a damn what anyone outside of his program thinks is something Matta was forced to learn early in his career. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget when I went to Xavier,\u201d Matta says, referring to his move after just one season of experience as a head coach, at Butler. \u201cI was playing golf one day with [then\u2013Xavier athletic director] Mike Bobinski and a guy named Bob Kohlhepp, who was the CEO of Cintas. We finished golfing and we\u2019re sitting there drinking some water, and they said to me, \u2018Thad, you do realize that if we don\u2019t get 10,250 people into the Cintas Center every night, the school won\u2019t run.\u2019 And I remember getting in the car like, \u2018Hoooooly shit, what did I get myself into?\u2019\u201d Lorenzo Romar\u2019s Last (Last) ChanceWashington\u2019s coach keeps landing top talent and failing to succeedtheringer.com Even if Matta insists that he blocks out the outside noise, doing so has become much more difficult in recent seasons. Maybe years of dealing with the pressure finally caught up to him, and maybe that explains why Matta briefly lost his enthusiasm and carefree approach to the game. David Egelhoff, Ohio State\u2019s director of basketball operations and the only person who has been a part of the program for all of Matta\u2019s tenure in Columbus, has a different theory. He insists that declining health was the biggest factor that led to the coach\u2019s rut. \u201cHis health, right now, is the best I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Egelhoff says. \u201cThere were some times there, back when stuff [Matta\u2019s back surgery] first went down in the summer of 2007, and then times after that, especially in 2011, 2012, 2013, and maybe even into 2014, when I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can physically get him back out to the court after halftime.\u2019 After games, he\u2019d lay on the locker-room floor to try to alleviate his pain, and we\u2019d have to literally pick him up to get him standing again. He was that bad. He\u2019s since been able to figure things out. He\u2019s prioritized his life and he\u2019s gotten healthy, and I think it\u2019s made a big difference.\u201d Matta, who was an avid distance runner before having surgery, agrees that he\u2019s as close to pain-free as he\u2019s been in a decade, thanks to both regular exercise and a refusal to dwell on things beyond his control. One of those is how much he\u2019s appreciated by Ohio State fans, the most irrational of whom have called for his firing. It seems like this should enrage Matta, who arrived at a football school in 2004, inherited a basketball program in shambles, and has built one of the most successful tenures of any coach in the nation since. He just lets it all roll off his back. \u201cLou Holtz once told me, \u2018Never stay at a school for more than seven years. Because the longer you stay, the more you fall in love with the place and the more they fall out of love with you,\u2019\u201d Matta says. \u201cAnd I remember in Year [7] at Ohio State, which was the year we started 24\u20130. I can remember coming off the floor and we\u2019d win by 12 and people would be like, \u2018Hey, Thad! 12 points? That\u2019s it?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Lou was right!\u2019 I can still remember thinking he was on to something. It\u2019s like the old Ricky Nelson song\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t please everybody so you gotta please yourself.\u201d For all he\u2019s accomplished, there\u2019s one box that Matta has yet to check: win a national championship. It\u2019s something every college coach dreams about, but few ever have an opportunity to make it a reality. Matta has had many chances, yet he\u2019s come up short to varying degrees each time. His 2004 Xavier team was three minutes away from knocking off top-seeded Duke for a trip to the Final Four before Luol Deng, J.J. Redick, and the Blue Devils downed his Musketeers in the waning moments. In 2007, Matta\u2019s Buckeyes lost to Florida in the national championship, a game that he considers the biggest regret in his career, specifically because of his decision to bench Conley in the first half because of foul trouble instead of trusting his freshman point guard. Matta\u2019s 2009\u201310 team won the Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles, featured national player of the year Evan Turner, and lost to Tennessee by three in the Sweet 16 when Turner\u2019s last-second shot attempt was blocked. Getty Images The list goes on. The Buckeyes started the 2010\u201311 campaign 24\u20130, were ranked no. 1 for a lot of the season, and established themselves as the favorites to win the national championship before Kentucky pulled off a 62\u201360 upset in the Sweet 16. The following season produced Matta\u2019s second trip to the Final Four, where Ohio State dropped another close game, this time to Kansas, 64\u201362. In 2013, Matta\u2019s second-seeded Buckeyes fell victim to Wichita State\u2019s Cinderella run in the Elite Eight, as their comeback attempt fell four points short. During the six-year stretch from 2009 to 2014, Matta\u2019s teams averaged 28.3 wins per season, and their tourney trips ended with these results: two-point loss in double overtime, three-point loss, two-point loss, two-point loss, four-point loss, one-point loss. Those who know Matta best have speculated for years that a national championship is his white whale and that winning one would be enough to prompt him to retire. He\u2019s conscious of the lingering problems with his foot, and how he\u2019ll look and feel different at 70 than will most of his peers. His two daughters, Ali and Emily, are now in high school, with his oldest set to graduate in the spring. He\u2019s made enough money to last a few lifetimes, and for a man who originally dreamed of becoming a high school coach, he\u2019s enjoyed an astonishing amount of success. It\u2019s easy to envision him walking away should he finally reach the mountaintop, especially given that he\u2019s mentioned his desire to open a beach bar in Mexico and \u201cdo nothing all day\u201d so often that it\u2019s become difficult to tell if he\u2019s joking. \u201cI don\u2019t have an \u2018I\u2019m going to do this until this age\u2019 plan,\u201d Matta says. \u201cI want to do this as long as I possibly can, as long as I\u2019m enjoying what I\u2019m doing. Now, there are days throughout the course of the year when it\u2019s not fun. But it\u2019s the job. I talk to coaches before a game, after a game, or whatever. And we all got the same issues. We\u2019re all worn down and we\u2019re all upset or something, but we\u2019re all thankful for the jobs we have. I just fight the good fight and away I go. The hardest part is that I enjoy what I do. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worked a day in my life. Some days are harder, but I looove what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Two years ago, those words would have sounded like a man trying to convince himself that his heart\u2019s still in it. His honeymoon phase at Ohio State was over. His health was in shambles, and he\u2019d lost the three best players\u200a\u2014\u200aLaQuinton Ross, Aaron Craft, and Lenzelle Smith\u200a\u2014\u200afrom his 2013\u201314 team, which had been bounced in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Today, though, the statement rings sincere. Matta says he feels recharged, for reasons even he can\u2019t quite pinpoint. Maybe it\u2019s his health. Maybe his daughters\u200a\u2014\u200athe same little girls he vividly remembers wearing Ohio State cheerleading outfits at his introductory press conference in 2004\u200a\u2014\u200abeing on the verge of adulthood has adjusted his perspective. Maybe he has accomplished enough to stop worrying about proving himself and to simply enjoy the life he\u2019s built. Or maybe the fact that he has stopped wearing a tie on the sideline\u200a\u2014\u200asomething he says he\u2019s been waiting his entire career to have the confidence to pull off\u200a\u2014\u200ahas something to do with it. \u201cPart of his rejuvenation is that he\u2019s back to coaching basketball instead of dealing with the off-court distractions his recent teams have had,\u201d says Ohio State strength and conditioning coach Dave Richardson, who has been part of the program since Matta\u2019s second season in Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders to have a group of guys that he can just coach without worrying about all the other stuff. He loves basketball and he loves the process of making his team better. But kids don\u2019t seem to love that process like they used to. He\u2019s got a team that does love it, though, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so excited to come to work every day.\u201d Perhaps the most notable manifestation of his rejuvenation came a little over a month ago. Despite maintaining a sharp sense of humor behind closed doors, Matta has historically been reserved with his public persona. It\u2019s fair to say, then, that modeling Ohio State\u2019s new uniforms on Twitter in late September was an enormous departure from what he\u2019s typically been willing to let the public see. Just don\u2019t expect this to be a regular thing. Matta has never had a social media account of any kind and barely, for that matter, even comprehends the concept. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d Matta says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that world. When they took the picture, they said, \u2018Can we post this?\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what \u2018post this\u2019 means. I don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re saying this had so many hits, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Explain to me what a hit is.\u2019 I don\u2019t understand. Someone texted me, \u2018You\u2019ve now got street cred,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018What is street cred? Who do I have street cred with?\u2019 I had no idea. As soon as it came out, [former Ohio State All-American] D\u2019Angelo [Russell] was texting me and he\u2019s busting my balls. So someone says D\u2019Angelo has 500,000 followers and I\u2019m like, \u2018What is a follower?\u2019 So they\u2019re explaining that if he sends that out then 500,000 people see that because they\u2019re linked to him and I\u2019m like, \u2018What the fuck is going on here?\u2019\u201d It almost feels as if the past few years have served as a transformation chamber for Matta. He stepped into it a young and hungry coach desperate to get his white whale, and he came out an elder statesman excited for the next phase of his career. The white whale still matters, of course, but Matta is more concerned with helping his players accomplish their dreams. \u201cI hope when the time comes,\u201d Matta says, \u201cthat people look and say, \u2018You know what, he did a hell of a job for this university. He did it the right way, he was true to his players, and he was true to himself.\u2019 And if that\u2019s said, then I\u2019m good. I know I\u2019ve never scored a point. I\u2019ve never gotten a rebound. The players are the ones that built this program. Obviously as a coach you\u2019re directing the ship and pointing it in the right direction and all that stuff. But I didn\u2019t get into this profession to get famous or make money. I got in it because I loved the game of basketball. I loved what I was doing. And I think that\u2019s the lesson in the end\u200a\u2014\u200alove what you\u2019re doing every day and things will take care of themselves.\u201d Matta still loves what he\u2019s doing, even if some on the outside struggle to figure out why. Given all the factors in play, it would be hard to blame him if he decided to hang up his whistle at some point in the next few years. And while he might not have the when part of the end of his career figured out, he does have a pretty good idea of what the how will look like. \u201cI tell my assistants,\u201d he says, \u201cthat my goal in life is for someone to come up to them and say, \u2018Didn\u2019t you used to work for that Thad Matta guy? Whatever happened to him?\u2019\u201d For now, the beach bar in Mexico will have to wait. Matta has plenty of teaching still in him, with a team he believes is eager to learn. He\u2019s not the same coach or person he was a decade ago, but that\u2019s a good thing. He has a new lease on life and his career, and at long last his health and priorities are in order. Now all that\u2019s left to do is get that white whale. "}
