If water caused the erosion these structures would be cut off at the bottom and fall over. Some water is involved but wind and pulverizing sand cuts a lot of this away. Just like Niagara Falls, the top layer is shale\u200a\u2014\u200asand stone or lime stone with clay. The clay is from river run off and it makes the shale harder, heavier and the least erosive. Looking at the arch, you can see that the weight on top pushes down and out to the sides, making the sides stronger and harder. Some water could puddle in the middle making that sandstone softer. Eventually the middle cracks away, working its way to the top and in time the whole structure collapses. Several arches fall every 20 to 30 yrs. Go see them while they\u2019re hot!
