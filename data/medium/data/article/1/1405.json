This is what I did when I didn\u2019t know what to do next. This is what it looked like for me to move from aspiring writer with a day job to full-time writer and bestselling author. It really is this easy. And this hard. 1. Choose a\u00a0topic You must have something important to share before you start writing. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald said, \u201cYou don\u2019t write because you want to say something. You write because you have something to say.\u201d What will you write about?

That\u2019s your premise. 3. Think about your\u00a0reader The golden rule of writing is that you must know your audience. You must know a lot about them and their needs so that when you write, they know you understand where they\u2019re coming from. If you do that, if you meet them where they are, you can lift them up to where you want them to be. And they\u2019ll be forever loyal to you because of it. 4. Create an\u00a0outline An outline often feels like the boring part of writing. Maybe you think it\u2019s limiting your creativity or holding you back from just getting started. But the truth is, taking the time to create an outline will make the rest of your writing go so much faster and more smoothly. I know from experience. While writing my fifth book this summer, I realized two-thirds of the way through\u200a\u2014\u200aafter writing 40,000 words\u200a\u2014\u200athat everything was suddenly coming more easily than they had in previous chapters. Why? Because I\u2019d accidentally given myself an outline: Five things, in order, that I wanted to make sure to cover in that chapter. And with that outline in front of me, writing became a simple exercise of filling in the blanks. (Simple, but not easy, of course.) 5. Read, read,\u00a0read If you want to be a writer, reading is not a luxury. It is a necessity. You must read widely and frequently both to see how it\u2019s done, and to see how you can do it differently. There\u2019s no shortcut to this, but I do know of a few ways to get more reading time into your day. 6. Set a due\u00a0date When my wife was pregnant earlier this year, we knew the day that our daughter would be arriving. That due date set in motion all kinds of activity for our family and my business. We knew we had to be done by a specific date because ready or not, we would be adding to our family that day. There was no opportunity to procrastinate, no leeway for laziness. Treat your writing the same way, with the same dedication to a due date. Once you\u2019ve decided what you want to write and who it\u2019s for, it\u2019s time to be a professional and commit to a completion date. If you don\u2019t, life has a way of interrupting and overshadowing our best intentions. If an arbitrary completion date isn\u2019t sufficient motivation for you, attach a consequence to not accomplishing your goal. A friend of mine, a talented writer, did this recently when he wanted to finish a book he\u2019d been thinking about for years. Fearing he might never reach the last page, he wrote a check to a political candidate he hated, and post-dated it for X months in the future. Then he gave the check to a friend with strict instructions to mail it if he had not completed his book by that date. The result? He\u2019s done with his book. 7. Create a writing\u00a0schedule Your season of life will dictate the writing schedule that works for you, so there\u2019s no use in trying to copy what another author is doing. We can find inspiration in how others structure their days, but the point is this: Find a regular schedule that works for you, and commit to showing up on that schedule from now until the day your book is complete. There will be days it\u2019s tempting to skip, and those, of course, are the days it\u2019s probably most important that you keep showing up. That\u2019s what a schedule is, after all. It\u2019s a way to remove your own willpower and whims from the work of being an author. Because yes, even a dream job is still a job. 8. Write, don\u2019t\u00a0edit We hear this one all the time, but it bears repeating because it\u2019s almost always the thing that\u2019s keeping you from finishing your book. If you\u2019re obsessing over every sentence as you write it, you\u2019re not just being a perfectionist. You\u2019re actually withholding momentum from yourself; you\u2019re preventing yourself from entering into that all-important state of \u201cflow\u201d where the words come easily and the goal feels achievable. If you\u2019re trying to write entirely perfect sentences and a perfect book, you\u2019re pursuing the wrong goal. Instead, find a strategy that will allow you to write first, and edit later. I use what I call the three-bucket system, and maybe that will help you, too. What makes a writer is the writing. So you\u2019d better get started.
