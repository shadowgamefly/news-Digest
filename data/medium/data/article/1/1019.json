White space is a concept that will help you to make beautiful, easy to read websites. We live in the times of constant distraction. All kinds of information surround us from printed and digital media, outdoor advertising, online ads. Websites, e-commerces, mobile apps\u200a\u2014\u200athey are all full of content. We should create websites users like to visit. All layouts need to be easy to understand, with scannable and readable content. \u2018Crowded\u2019 websites are difficult to read. Complexity often makes users uncomfortable. If we\u2019ve overwhelmed them with lots of different information, all fighting for their attention, they will leave or not take the action we\u2019d wanted them to do. It may be purchasing something on e-commerce website or reading the article on a blog. There is, however, a concept that helps graphic designers to create great web experiences, making the content appealing and easy to follow. It\u2019s white space\u200a\u2014\u200athe way of giving your layouts extra room, simply by avoiding unnecessary clutter and using the space between elements for their advantage. What is White\u00a0Space The best description for white space should be a simple one, as the idea itself indicates simplicity: White space, or negative space, is the empty space on the website. It is a space left unmarked, that not only makes the layout more readable but it also tones up the content. The user may focus on fewer, better presented elements. COS online store is an example of a premium clothing brand using white space to enhance the impression of high quality. The evolution of the concept of\u00a0space We can trace the history of white space back to the \u2018New Typography\u2019 movement. It emerged in 1920s, led by Jan Tschichold. The movement proclaimed these principles: Beatrice Warde\u2019s\u00a0goblet Another example of an early concept of white space in typography is an essay of Beatrice Warde, \u201cThe Crystal Goblet\u201d, from 1930. Warde described two goblets: first one \u201cof solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns\u201d, and the second one \u201cof crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent\u201d. Choosing one of them would show whether the person is truly a connoisseur of wine, or not. The crystal goblet reveals the person\u2019s admiration for wine, \u201cbecause everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than to hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.\u201d Warde made this metaphor to make a call for increased clarity in printing and typography. She understood that a proper use of space helps to enrich the content. What you can achieve with negative\u00a0space What Tschichold and Warde covered in their works, we can explain today with cognitive science. White space, or negative space, is the space between the elements of your composition. It doesn\u2019t have to be literally white or blank, though. It is a background with no cognitive weight for the users, so that they can focus on the main elements. When it comes to graphic design, building a visual hierarchy between different UI elements is key. It helps to point the user towards the strategic points of interaction. Moreover, white space helps to reduce the information clutter on the page, giving a content more breath. Having all that in mind, let\u2019s recap what we can achieve using white space in web design: 1. The website is easier to\u00a0scan A balanced arrangement of the blank space enhances the ease of scanning the website. Users can easily go through the content, so it is easier for them to find what they\u2019re searching for. 2. Improved readability of the\u00a0content Keeping the proper distance between characters makes the content easier to read. It helps users to read the web content faster, and easier. 3. Improved aesthetics Implementing more blank space and reducing unnecessary elements can drastically improve your website\u2019s visual appeal. Ask yourself a question: would you rather browse a page full of clutter, pop-ups, banners, and unnecessary visual effects, or a simple, easy to scan and read website, that gets straight to the point? 4. Impression of high\u00a0quality Abundance of visual elements can lower the impression of quality. Using blank space, on the other hand, does the opposite. White space makes the website seem lighter, more elegant. Lack of objects competing for users\u2019 attention improves their experience. Types of white space you can\u00a0use Now that you\u2019ve seen the advantages of the white space, let\u2019s put that into practice. There are several kinds of negative space you can implement: 1. Macro\u00a0space This is the space between different elements. It helps to build a hierarchy and ensure the proper flow on the site. 2. Micro\u00a0space Micro-spaces are smaller blanks between the elements. We can use them to improve the clarity and transparency of a layout. 3. Active\u00a0space Surrounding objects with white space points users\u2019 attention towards them, increasing their visibility as well as users\u2019 awareness. 4. Passive\u00a0space It\u2019s the minimal space between the elements, necessary for keeping proper navigation, spotting the active elements of the interface, and ensuring good readability of the content. White space best practices To get an even better idea of how to implement white space in your designs and to see how powerful it may be, let\u2019s take a look at some examples of brands that used it well. Oculus landing page is a good example of how to sell a product without too much information. All it takes is a compelling photo, clear copy, call to action, and enough space between elements. The clothing e-commerce brand ETQ. proves that simplicity sells. Reducing clutter and unnecessary information push user\u2019s focus towards products. And, at the same time, the quality of the brand is translated through the design. Invision\u2019s blog is a great example of using the right combination of copywriting, photography, and calls to action to encourage visitors to read a blog post. It might seem that there\u2019s nothing revolutionary in these designs. But, at the same time, you can sense the difference between them and other websites with too much content. It is tempting to cram in as much information as you can. Sometimes your client may want you to do it. Either way, it is a designer\u2019s role to take only the most important elements, to create a website with clear message, and proper user flow. Use white space to build a visual hierarchy of the UI elements, so that your website always delivers a great experience. Do you have any thoughts after reading all of this?
