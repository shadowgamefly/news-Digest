But, actually, it is a day to mark for me, less for the symbolism of the anniversary and more for what\u2019s happened in the decade since. For me, it\u2019s a prime example of how good things can come out of bad things\u200a\u2014\u200ahow, very often, events that come to define our lives in positive ways would never have happened without events that were painful and sometimes, yes, even bloody!"}, {"5d06": "For me, that day literally changed my life. It put me on a course in which I changed how I work and how I live. It put me on a course of writing two books, Thrive and The Sleep Revolution.

It\u2019s a part of our everyday conversation and, collectively, it\u2019s finally coming to be regarded as the public health issue it is. More and more people are coming out to talk about their own wake-up calls, or how they changed their lives, or just about problems they\u2019re having changing the way they work and live.
