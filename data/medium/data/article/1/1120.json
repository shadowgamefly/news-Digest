The most valuable information I learned was from Warren Buffet. He says that if you don\u2019t have the time or interest to investigate and track individual stocks, it\u2019s best to buy index funds or index-tracking stocks. This is because most mutual fund managers can\u2019t beat the market, and yet they charge hefty commissions. With these stockbrokers, I had not even been buying managed mutual funds, I was buying individual stocks, relying only on their choices. That\u2019s the worst thing I could have done."}, {"7395": "I have also learned that most of the people on Wall Street either don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on, for one reason or another, or they\u2019re unable to make the most effective decisions. For example, most Wall Street types are out of touch with what\u2019s happening in the real world, so they don\u2019t know what the trends are. In the book Laughing at Wall Street, the author explains how he made millions by beating institutional investors into and out of stocks by noticing trends on the street months before the institutional investors became aware of them. An example of limitations in the decision-making choices of large mutual funds is that small- and medium-sized companies tend to grow at a significantly faster rate than the entire market, yet large mutual funds are unable or unwilling to invest in them because they\u2019re too small. Mutual funds often have to maintain certain mixes of investments to stay within the parameters specified to those who have already invested in them. It\u2019s hard for even hedge funds to make effective long-term choices, because they are always trying to keep their investors happy in the short-term."}, {"eca3": "Note that I\u2019m talking about real Wall Street types, real investment bankers and mutual fund managers. My local stockbrokers were not even that. Nevertheless, the incompetence on Wall Street is staggering.

After a few experiences of losing enormous amounts of money in these transactions, I looked into it more deeply, and discovered that even though the banks don\u2019t charge a fee for transferring money between countries and currencies, they do add a spread onto the exchange rate. This spread is so large (several percent) that they can make an enormous amount of money on a single transaction."}, {"f010": "For example, if you moved $1,000,000 between two currencies, a bank might add a 5% spread to the transaction for an unsuspecting wealthy customer.

When I called the bank\u2019s international currency trading center, based in another country, they were unable to explain to me how I could transfer money without unnecessarily enriching them in this way. It\u2019s essentially part of their business model: make rich people feel special and then rip them off."}, {"19ec": "I discovered that there are currency brokerages that will buy and sell currencies, and transfer money internationally for you, with a variable spread that amounts to only a few thousand on a very large transaction.

This pair of advisors, actually \u201cstockbrokers,\u201d told me a lot about the marathons they ran in Hawaii before proceeding to advise me to buy a bunch of individual stocks. Over a period of months, they would call me, \u201cWe like Lucent Technologies!\u201d and I would say, \u201cOkay, buy $20,000 of that for me.\u201d and then they would bill me $1,000 brokerage commission. That\u2019s a 5% commission for \u201cliking\u201d something. I was a fool. I had an online brokerage account where I could have got the same stock for a $10 fee. When I told them about my stock options, they said, \u201cNever heard of that company! You need to get out of that!\u201d I ended up cashing-in large chunks of the stock in my company to buy all these hot internet stocks that they liked. During my last meeting with them, they asked me if they could exercise and sell some more of my stock options in order to buy some of company X. I told them I couldn\u2019t because I was in a black-out period. They looked confused. Later, I got an email telling me that a bunch of my stock options had been exercised and sold and that I was the proud owner of company X. I called them to ask what was happening. They said that I had told them to sell the stock. I said I hadn\u2019t. The guy on the phone told me that his partner had been there and witnessed it. I told them to undo the stock trades before I got jailed for insider trading, and I fired them. That\u2019s when I realized that I had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies that I knew nothing about. Looking back, I feel consoled understanding that the stock brokers knew nothing about the stocks either. That\u2019s also when the dot-com bubble burst and that basket of stocks halved in price, while the stock for the company I worked at kept on climbing (it wasn\u2019t a dot com company). I started reading books about investment. The most valuable information I learned was from Warren Buffet. He says that if you don\u2019t have the time or interest to investigate and track individual stocks, it\u2019s best to buy index funds or index-tracking stocks. This is because most mutual fund managers can\u2019t beat the market, and yet they charge hefty commissions. With these stockbrokers, I had not even been buying managed mutual funds, I was buying individual stocks, relying only on their choices. That\u2019s the worst thing I could have done. I have also learned that most of the people on Wall Street either don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on, for one reason or another, or they\u2019re unable to make the most effective decisions. For example, most Wall Street types are out of touch with what\u2019s happening in the real world, so they don\u2019t know what the trends are. In the book Laughing at Wall Street, the author explains how he made millions by beating institutional investors into and out of stocks by noticing trends on the street months before the institutional investors became aware of them. An example of limitations in the decision-making choices of large mutual funds is that small- and medium-sized companies tend to grow at a significantly faster rate than the entire market, yet large mutual funds are unable or unwilling to invest in them because they\u2019re too small. Mutual funds often have to maintain certain mixes of investments to stay within the parameters specified to those who have already invested in them. It\u2019s hard for even hedge funds to make effective long-term choices, because they are always trying to keep their investors happy in the short-term. Note that I\u2019m talking about real Wall Street types, real investment bankers and mutual fund managers. My local stockbrokers were not even that. Nevertheless, the incompetence on Wall Street is staggering. I recommend reading the book The Big Short (a movie was made of it), to understand how much opportunity there is to make money by taking the radical approach of reading financial reports and thinking about them. By the way, reading and thinking are two of Warren Buffet\u2019s secret weapons. Banks rip-off wealthy people\u00a0too I have transferred a lot of money between countries, and I have used services provided by banks to help wealthy people to move their money around effortlessly. After a few experiences of losing enormous amounts of money in these transactions, I looked into it more deeply, and discovered that even though the banks don\u2019t charge a fee for transferring money between countries and currencies, they do add a spread onto the exchange rate. This spread is so large (several percent) that they can make an enormous amount of money on a single transaction. For example, if you moved $1,000,000 between two currencies, a bank might add a 5% spread to the transaction for an unsuspecting wealthy customer. So then the transaction would cost an additional $50,000. That\u2019s a completely unnecessary expense. After a few instances of transferring money internationally using my bank, I understood this problem. I kept finding much less money in the target currency than I had expected based on the market exchange rate. When I called the bank\u2019s international currency trading center, based in another country, they were unable to explain to me how I could transfer money without unnecessarily enriching them in this way. It\u2019s essentially part of their business model: make rich people feel special and then rip them off. I discovered that there are currency brokerages that will buy and sell currencies, and transfer money internationally for you, with a variable spread that amounts to only a few thousand on a very large transaction. I\u2019m not talking about Western Union, by the way. More zeros are just more\u00a0zeros You can write anything you want on a check. I have written many checks with six figures on them. I assume that it\u2019s the same deal with seven, eight, nine, or ten figures. You just write the number on there. Banks don\u2019t say, \u201coh, this is a big check!\u201d They just honor the check. This was an eye-opener for me. The number of zeros means nothing. Large amounts of money are just large numbers. When you look at your brokerage account and see seven figures, they\u2019re just numbers. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. The biggest issue people have with money is limiting\u00a0beliefs I have worked with a lot of people in therapy, and I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people about money and wealth. I have a very strong impression that what defines how much money or income anyone has is almost completely defined by their limiting beliefs. We all hold beliefs. Beliefs are held because we had experiences in the past that have not been fully lived and integrated, and that still live within our minds, controlling our actions without our conscious awareness. Since money is such a power symbol for freedom, survival, control, power, legacy, continuation, and survival, it becomes tied up with so many of these early experiences. Our ability to generate, retain, and utilize money is almost completely defined by these unconsciously-driven beliefs. I highly recommend getting a therapist or coach to work with you on your money-related limiting beliefs. Fuck-you-money is overrated I remember one time making a management decision that was overruled by my manager. I remember saying to him, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t agree with you, and you can fire me if you want.\u201d He chuckled. I don\u2019t know what he really thought of that, and nothing negative happened to me. I played the \u201cfuck you\u201d card, and it didn\u2019t feel particularly good. In 2007, I quit my job and basically retired. I took on a large number of projects and I worked my ass off. I had the freedom to do many things that I wanted to, and many more things that didn\u2019t really serve me. Meanwhile, I didn\u2019t take the opportunity to really retire, to just do nothing, to backpack around the world and lie on beaches, and to surf all day. Okay, I did spend some periods, lasting months at a time, living in inexpensive tropical places surfing a lot, but I didn\u2019t do it as much as I now wish I had. Those experiences were good for me. Often doing the thing that is the most difficult or strange for you\u2014which for me is going on vacation\u2014can actually be the most transformative. The moral of this story is that you can have all the fuck-you-money in the world, but left to your own devices, without deep inner work, often facilitated by a great coach or therapist, you\u2019re going to spend your time essentially fucking yourself over. Being wealthy is a full-time job There\u2019s a foolish impression that once you have a lot of money, you can kick back and relax. To some degree this is true. You can have more choice, and you can buffer situations in your life to some degree. However, once you have assets you have to manage them, protect them, and maintain them. You need to worry about being sued, so you need insurance. You need to hire people to do stuff for you, and you need to manage them. Delegation is really hard. If you\u2019re not careful, you will make your life more complex, with more things, and more activities. Perhaps you will use spending money and buying things as a cheap way of avoiding self-awareness. Perhaps you will become obsessed with hoarding your money and maximizing its growth. Some people become very suspicious of other people, not trusting that they really have friends, thinking that others are trying to get at their wealth. Even with the best intentions, others will seek funding and support from you. They want you to invest in their businesses and projects. They want to borrow money. All of this is a massive strain on your ability to be aware of your boundaries, and avoid being co-dependent or enabling. It\u2019s really challenging being wealthy. Approach with caution. Conclusion Being wealthy is not all it\u2019s often cracked up to be. It can be amazing, if you know how to approach it. I recommend finding a guide who can help you to attain and retain the wealth you desire, and to reap the maximum benefits and pay the minimum costs.
