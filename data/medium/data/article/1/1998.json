It\u2019s a tiny distinction, I know, but I\u2019m convinced it makes a world of difference in the NCAA tournament, especially for a program that traditionally plays a conservative style. The Badgers have produced plenty of great players through the years, but most of them fit a familiar mold.

If he were only as good as he was last year, Wisconsin would be like so many Badgers teams in the past: good enough to beat anyone in America, but not good enough to be remembered.

Case in point: The Badgers have played three ranked opponents this season (Creighton, North Carolina, and Purdue) that rate among the top third of teams in the KenPom adjusted tempo statistic, and those three games account for all of Wisconsin\u2019s losses, each coming by double digits. Still, you would have to be crazy to count Wisconsin out.

Wisconsin (21\u20133) Purdue\u2019s Caleb Swanigan is the best player in the Big Ten, and assuming the people who vote on this stuff don\u2019t have an ax to grind, he should win the conference\u2019s player of the year award by a comfortable margin. I don\u2019t say that to be confrontational. I say it because I hate the notion that liking someone now means that you automatically hate that person\u2019s competitor. Because while I\u2019m as big a fan of Swanigan as any that exists, to the point that I\u2019m reeeeeallllly close to convinced that he\u2019s the best player in America, that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t acknowledge that Wisconsin\u2019s Ethan Happ is the nation\u2019s best defender and one of the 10 best players in college basketball. In 2006\u201307, I helplessly watched as people all over the Midwest pretended that Alando Tucker was better than Greg Oden, so I get why Wisconsin fans are upset that their dominant big man is getting overshadowed by someone who they feel isn\u2019t as good as his stats would suggest. But trust me on this one, Wisconsin fans: Let it go. Concede the Swanigan-versus-Happ debate and take solace in knowing that all signs point to the Badgers making a deep NCAA tournament run, while Swanigan will probably go something like 1-for-6 from the 3-point line as the Boilermakers get upset in\u00a0\u2026 oh, I don\u2019t know\u00a0\u2026 let\u2019s say the second round by a Mountain West team that hasn\u2019t made the Sweet 16 in 16 years. Ethan Happ (Getty\u00a0Images) Part of what makes those who love Happ so eager to sing his praises is there isn\u2019t a player in the country like him. In fact, I can\u2019t think of a college player who has ever been like him. If someone who\u2019d never watched Happ asked me to describe his game, I\u2019d raise my eyebrows and slowly shake my head before offering up something like this: \u201cHe\u2019s like a 6-foot-10 point guard, only he isn\u2019t explosive, he never shoots jumpers, he\u2019s got a deadly old-man post-up game, he averages nine boards, and he\u2019s a rim protector on defense. So basically he\u2019s not a point guard at all, except that he leads the Badgers in steals, can orchestrate a fast break, and averages 2.8 assists. Who knows? Maybe you should just watch him and draw your own conclusions. All I can tell you is it makes perfect sense that he plays for Wisconsin.\u201d A sophomore blossoming into an All-American-type talent would be a boon for any program, but Happ\u2019s emergence has been especially impactful for a Wisconsin team desperate for a bona fide star. The Badgers entered this season returning all five starters\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding four seniors\u200a\u2014\u200afrom 2015\u201316\u2019s Sweet 16 squad, which was enough to earn them a no. 9 ranking in the preseason AP poll. Their big concern, though, was that none of their players were overwhelmingly talented, leaving many to believe that this team had an obvious ceiling. I figured Wisconsin would use its experience and chemistry to win a decent amount of games and maybe even make a Big Ten title run, but I saw no reason to take it too seriously beyond that. I just couldn\u2019t get behind the idea that Nigel Hayes was good enough to be the best player on a national champion. Think back on all the great teams Bo Ryan had at Wisconsin that underperformed come March. (I know head coach Greg Gard isn\u2019t Ryan, but he\u2019s cut from the same cloth, so go with it.) The difference between them and Ryan\u2019s two Final Four squads (2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315) was that the latter featured Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker, two guys who could be classified as serious and unusual problems for opponents rather than simply great players. It\u2019s a tiny distinction, I know, but I\u2019m convinced it makes a world of difference in the NCAA tournament, especially for a program that traditionally plays a conservative style. The Badgers have produced plenty of great players through the years, but most of them fit a familiar mold. Wisconsin didn\u2019t experience its breakthrough until Kaminsky, a 7-foot mismatch nightmare who could do everything, and Dekker, a 6-foot-9 small forward with NBA-caliber range, came along and gave the team an element it had previously lacked. You know how coaches do weird things, like use broomsticks in practice to simulate an opponent\u2019s length, when preparing for players who are so special that memorizing their tendencies isn\u2019t enough? That\u2019s what Happ brings to Wisconsin. If he were only as good as he was last year, Wisconsin would be like so many Badgers teams in the past: good enough to beat anyone in America, but not good enough to be remembered. Instead, Happ has emerged as a full-fledged superstar, which explains how Wisconsin has won 17 of its last 18, sits atop the Big Ten standings, and has ascended to the no. 7 spot in the AP poll. I still think this Wisconsin team is more like the late-2010s Badgers than the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 teams, mostly because I\u2019m not sold that this group has the flexibility to adjust to the different styles. Case in point: The Badgers have played three ranked opponents this season (Creighton, North Carolina, and Purdue) that rate among the top third of teams in the KenPom adjusted tempo statistic, and those three games account for all of Wisconsin\u2019s losses, each coming by double digits. Still, you would have to be crazy to count Wisconsin out. Because while the Badgers have a weakness, so will every other team in America when it plays Wisconsin: It won\u2019t have Ethan Happ. Northwestern Basketball Just Wants One DanceThe pain and guarded optimism of rooting for the Wildcats to end their NCAA tournament droughttheringer.com 4.

Gonzaga\u00a0(24\u20130) The Reckless Bus Driver of the\u00a0Week St. Louis University\u2019s basketball team was temporarily stranded in western New York when its bus went missing following Wednesday\u2019s 70\u201355 loss at St. Bonaventure. Thanks to the GPS tracking device on head coach Travis Ford\u2019s iPad, the vehicle was discovered 40 miles from the arena, with a driver behind the wheel whose blood-alcohol content registered at 0.22, according to a police statement. The driver was arrested, the bus and team\u2019s property were returned, and the Billikens got a new driver to take them safely to the airport. That seems to be where the story ends, which leaves me with so many questions. Was the driver trying to steal the bus or the team\u2019s stuff? That would seem to make sense, but apparently nothing was taken. Did she think that her job was only to drop the team off, and that someone else would get the Billikens after the game? And most puzzlingly, how did she get so drunk so fast? She probably dropped the team off about 90 minutes before tip-off. The game took roughly two hours, meaning she had about three and a half hours to go from stone-cold sober to Stone Cold Steve Austin. So had she already been drinking when she was driving to the arena? Or did she just have one hell of a party during the game? It\u2019s infuriating that I will never get these answers.
