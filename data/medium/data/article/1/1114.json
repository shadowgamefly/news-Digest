This \u201cRyanCare\u201d bill simply seeks to undo the things insurance companies and conservatives don\u2019t like- it ends tax subsidies to lower-middle-class consumers (these are people who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, have jobs that don\u2019t provide care, and have to buy personal plans), allows insurance companies to give more money in executive bonuses (with tax credits), ends the individual mandate (welcome back to the uninsured showing up at the emergency room for care, with no way to pay) and replaces the mandate with huge surcharges to those who lapse their coverage. There are winners in their plan- wealthy people, insurance companies, and some young, healthy people. There are bigger losers though- the working poor, the elderly, health providers and anyone who was buying their own plan in the marketplace. This plan lowers taxes on the upper income earners in our country, but it hurt Medicare and Medicaid recipients and the working poor. It is basically a Republican response to the things they don\u2019t like about the Affordable Care Act, not their twist on how to lower premiums, increase access, lower deficits and protect consumers. It\u2019s basically going back to a pre-ACA world."}, {"fc3c": "Obviously the Affordable Care Act needed some revisions seven years after it\u2019s passage. All legislation does. Obviously one would hope the Republican Party would bring forward it\u2019s best and brightest ideas to solve the problems the initial ACA attempted to solve too. They didn\u2019t. Instead the Republican Party brought forward a bill to cut taxes and cut Grandma\u2019s coverage. Tax subsidies and health savings accounts are not the solution for people who can neither afford to save much or buy health insurance, and basically the Republican plan tells them to go to hell. This is not amending the existing legislation, it\u2019s not even a replacement after a true repeal- it\u2019s a middle-finger to the 20 million people who were getting quality health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, all to help health care executives and rich people.
