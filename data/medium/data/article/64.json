You are the first explorer on Mars and you discover a math equation carved into a rock: 12 + 24 = 40. How many fingers did Martians\u00a0have? I love this riddle because it makes you rethink your entire understanding of numbers.

So why are we using a 10-based number system? You guessed it\u200a\u2014\u200awe have 10 fingers! Here\u2019s a little visualization of how a 10-based number system works. Notice that every time one column fills up we add one more to the next column over. The beauty of this way of looking at numbers is that the concept of a quantity feels natural for all number systems, not just base-10. So let\u2019s explore some other number systems. Computer\u2019s represent numbers using binary which is a base-2 number system. It\u2019s the same concept except rather than rolling over to the next column after 9 dots fill up, you roll over after only 1. Programmers often represent numbers using hexadecimal which is a base-16 number system. They do this because binary isn\u2019t very compact\u200a\u2014\u200ait takes 4 binary digits just to represent the number 16\u200a\u2014\u200aand because 16 is a power of 2 which makes it easy to convert between the two number systems. Since it would be weird for a number like 12 to represent only one digit place when we write it out, we usually start counting up the alphabet after 9. That is, A represents 10, B represents 11, C represents 12, and so on. And now for our riddle! First, see if you can\u2019t figure it out yourself. If you want, you can play around with the visualization tool yourself. I\u2019ve already given you a big hint\u200a\u2014\u200awe have a 10-based number system because we have 10 fingers! So if we can find a number system where those symbols represent numbers that satisfy the equation, then we\u2019ve solved the riddle. There\u2019s a more direct way of finding the answer but let\u2019s just use our good friend \u201cguess-and-check.\u201d Since every Martian in every pop-culture reference has 6 fingers, let\u2019s give that a shot. Let\u2019s recall the equation for reference: 12 + 24 = 40. As you can see, 8 is represented as 12 in a base-6 number system. That\u2019s because 8 = 1\u00d7\u2076\u00b9 + 2\u00d7\u2076\u2070. Here, you can see that 16 is represented as 23 in a base-6 number system. And finally, 24 is represented as 40in a base-6 number system. Thus, if we were to convert this equation into a base-10 number system, we\u2019d have 8 + 16 = 24. So there\u2019s the answer to the riddle\u200a\u2014\u200aMartians have 6 fingers! It\u2019s hard to understand this equation because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve learned to mechanically solve math problems. But we actually use non-base-10 number systems every day.
