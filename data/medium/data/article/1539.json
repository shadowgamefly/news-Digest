The state will elect a new at-large lawmaker to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election on May 25\u200a\u2014\u200athe seat was left vacant when President Trump named former Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT) to lead the Department of the Interior. Because the election was unplanned and not in the state\u2019s budget, lawmakers from both parties came together this year with clerks from nearly every county to recommend that the state conduct the election by mail. Allowing voters to cast ballots through the mail, they found, would save the state up to $750,000. But a bitter partisan battle in the legislature\u200a\u2014\u200awhich Democrats are labeling a voter suppression tactic\u200a\u2014\u200ahas prevented the state from putting this plan into action. Now, state lawmakers have just a few days to decide if mail-in ballots will go out to voters across the state, making it significantly easier and most cost-effective for voters to select their next representative. This last chance comes thanks to thanks to a move by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who resurrected the failed effort when he inserted a vote-by-mail provision into a separate bill that the legislature can consider. Emboldened Republicans push state-level voting restrictionsEfforts in Michigan, New Hampshire, Utah and Texas to roll back voting rights may go unchallenged if Sessions becomes\u2026thinkprogress.org The issue dates back to early this year, when Republican state senator Steve Fitzpatrick took the lead and introduced a bill to call for a mail-only election. \u201cThis bill is the fiscally responsible thing to do at this time, it\u2019s the fiscally conservative thing to do,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. Not all Republicans agreed. Just before the bill moved out of the Senate, Montana state Republican Chairman Rep. Jeff Essmann issued an \u201cemergency report\u201d warning that vote by mail would make it easier for Democrats to cast ballots. \u201cAll mail ballots give the Democrats an inherent advantage in close elections due to their ability to organize large numbers of unpaid college students and members of public employee unions to gather ballots by going door to door,\u201d Essmann wrote. The state party leader added that \u201cGeorge Soros backed groups are organizing to manipulate our special election.\u201d While Essmann\u2019s argument didn\u2019t come up during the Senate\u2019s debate, other GOP members spoke out about the possibility of voter fraud and the need to accommodate people who like to travel to polling places. Ultimately, the bill passed in the Senate when Fitzpatrick assured the legislature that a majority of Montanans already vote by mail each election. But when the bill moved to the state House of Representatives, the story changed. When Democrats forced a vote in late March, concerned that time was running out to print and mail ballots, Republicans voted along party lines to table the issue. One Republican who still supported vote by mail, Rep. Geraldine Custer (R), led an effort to \u201cblast\u201d the bill out of the Judiciary Committee anyway, but it failed to garner the necessary 60 votes. This week, Bullock brought the issue back into consideration when he issued an \u201camendatory veto,\u201d essentially adding language to a separate election law bill that would allow the legislature to once again consider enacting vote-by-mail before time runs out ahead of the May 25 election. Neither legislative body has a set a date for a vote. State Republicans\u200a\u2014\u200awho have stopped talking to the press about the issue\u200a\u2014\u200amay be hoping to run out the clock. Democratic candidate Rob Quist, who hopes to win Zinke\u2019s seat in May, is encouraging his Republican opponent, Greg Gianforte, to join him in pushing the state legislature to approve the measure. \u201cIf my opponent is committed to strengthening the right to vote and protecting the hard-earned dollars of Montana taxpayers, then he will join me in urging elected leaders in Helena to do the right thing,\u201d Quist said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s not let partisan politics get in the way of a commonsense proposal to encourage voter participation in May\u2019s election.\u201d Shane Scanlon, a spokesperson for Gianforte, told ThinkProgress that the candidate believes that whether or not the election is conducting by mail is a \u201cdecision that needs to be made by the legislature.\u201d This story has been updated with comment from Gianforte\u2019s campaign.
