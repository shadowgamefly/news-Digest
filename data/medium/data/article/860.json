{"name": "860", "parent": "", "content": "Speaking of My\u00a0Brother Larry, before\u00a0Iraq How do I write this without further breaking the hearts of people I love? I don\u2019t think I can. But here I am anyway, putting it out there for the world to see. A book that I think of often is called SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD. Written by Orson Scott Card, a \u201cSpeaker for the Dead\u201d is someone called after a death, who didn\u2019t know the deceased but takes on the job of researching their lives and \u201cspeaking\u201d the complete truth about them publicly after their death. The idea is that they tell the whole truth, good and bad, so that the complete person is known\u200a\u2014\u200anot just the lows and certainly not just the highs. So that is what this is. A speaking. Except in this case, I know the person I speak of. I was four years old when my brother Larry was born. He weighed 10 pounds and 10 ounces. Before he was home from the hospital, a neighbor told me I had a \u201cbig brother\u201d and I cried, thinking that he would be tall with hair under his arms like the big teenagers down the street instead of the cuddly little baby I had hoped for. He was a rowdy kid, loud and funny. He moved full steam ahead at all times - running, jumping, karate-chopping everything in his path. He adored our dad and imitated his every move. Dad was in law enforcement\u200a\u2014\u200aa federal officer with the Treasury Department specializing in narcotics\u2014 and my brother\u2019s favorite playtime exploits involved chasing down the bad guys just like Dad. Larry, Stephen, Myke and\u00a0Dad We lived in Florida when we were young and it was the 70\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aa crazy time and place for someone to be in the drug-busting business. We grew up hearing about all of the dangerous criminals Dad faced everyday\u200a\u2014\u200awe saw pictures of Dad posing with guns confiscated and bricks of cocaine stacked up like Legos. There was never any doubt Larry was going to grow up to be a cop like Dad. At 19, he got a job as a bailiff in a small town in Texas. He married and divorced a beautiful Italian girl, and had two adorable kids to show for it. He skipped college, as every kid in our family did, for reasons that had a lot to do with a combination of our parents not having gone, learning disabilities, and an inability to sit still for any length of time that definitely ran in the family. There was tragedy in our family background\u200a\u2014\u200ashifting family cohesiveness, divorce, alcohol, and more. Two of our younger brothers fell into homelessness and hard drugs. Stephen, our youngest and everyone\u2019s favorite, died at 19 in a fire in an abandoned building in Hollywood, California, too drunk to wake up and escape the flames. Our other younger brother, Myke, was by then very far gone into drugs and the street life as well, ultimately spending 15 years in and out of prison, homeless, and on heroin. Through it all, Larry was building his life brick by brick, as a law enforcement officer and a father. He remarried, this time to a lovely smart blonde Texan and fellow law enforcement officer named Cyndi that he met over an accident scene. They had a son together, a doppelganger for Larry who ran full-speed ahead at everything in his path. Eventually Larry was a homicide detective with Williamson County, Texas, one of the most conservative law-and-order beats in an already conservative God-and-Guns state. Our brother Myke was once arrested in Williamson County, and it hurt Larry so much to see how far Myke had fallen into addiction and despair. Always either on the streets or in prison, Myke missed all of the big family events, and with me and my sister living in other states, Larry became the one that my mom leaned on the most. Larry and\u00a0Mom Larry and Cyndi bought a few acres out in the country and stocked it with enough animals to call it a real ranch. Larry, an avid hunter his whole life, could bow hunt right on the property, a dream come true. They put what they could afford on it\u200a\u2014\u200aa trailer\u200a\u2014\u200abut saved up for their dream house, hoping to build the home they\u2019d leave to their children. All of that fell apart when Larry became involved in a whistle-blower case involving the Sheriff\u2019s department in Williamson County. He, along with a few others from his department, gave information to their new sheriff about misdeeds within the department. They trusted the sheriff to clean up the department, and shared their concerns about fellow department members. They campaigned publicly for the sheriff\u200a\u2014\u200abut when he didn\u2019t win the election, the whistle-blowers quickly fell out of favor with his successor, who knew about their loyalty. Larry was demoted, down from a detective to a patrolman. He lost years of seniority in one fell swoop. Everything he had worked for was taken away in the blink of an eye, with one command of the man who was quite literally \u201cthe new sheriff in town.\u201d Helpless to regain what he had lost, he filed a lawsuit along with the other whistle-blowers. But in the meantime, he had bills to pay and a dream to get back on course. He had the plans for his new house already drawn up and no means to make his trailer payment, much less build the house of his dreams. Somewhere in here, my dad died. His many mistakes\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding an addiction to prescription pain medication\u200a\u2014\u200ahad led to most of his kids turning away in self-preservation years before. But not Larry. He was loyal\u200a\u2014\u200aif frustrated\u200a\u2014\u200ato the end, and dug my dad\u2019s grave in the ancient family cemetery by himself, way out in the Texas countryside, alone. During this time, the war in Iraq was raging. Money was pouring into the private contractor industry\u200a\u2014\u200aand they began recruiting small town Texas law enforcement. Larry, with no military training but years of local law training, was recruited heavily\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with hundreds of other men. The pay was beyond anything they could have ever earned back home. Within a few months, he was vetted and contracted\u200a\u2014\u200aand headed to Iraq. It would be the first deer-season opening day he had ever missed. But it was a new adventure, one that would allow him to forget the humiliation of the demotion and allow him enough money\u200a\u2014\u200aif he survived\u200a\u2014\u200ato build the house and secure his future. We cried when he left, unsure if we\u2019d lose him to the job. But it was a lot of money\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially to someone without a college degree and not a lot of prospects in the field he\u2019d spent his life in. He served three contracts, training Iraqi policemen. He reveled in the work, feeling like he had missed his calling by not joining the army when he was young. He was proud of what he was doing and interested in everything around him. He sent back photos of the food, the tents, the men he trained. He wrote emails about his daily life with only the occasional complaint about the heat or the cramped quarters, \u201cMy room is ten foot by five foot. Needless to say, you feel like you\u2019re in prison.\u201d He sent the money home to Cyndi, who moved into a tiny RV on the land and supervised the construction of their home. As he skyped in from the Iraqi desert, the shape of his dream came into existence\u200a\u2014\u200aa big sprawling family home, with room enough for all of his kids, a place to host family holidays and rise up to become the patriarch of the family. The dream house almost\u00a0finished When Larry finally came home for good, his home was ready. It should have been the high point of his life. The dream home was built, the family all gathered, he had enough in the bank left over to take some time off and plan out his next phase. But the war had done something to Larry. He had always been an antsy kid, and an active man, with more plans than any one person could fit into a lifetime. But now that feverish brain went into overdrive. He couldn\u2019t sit still for a moment. He roamed the house with a bottle of cleaner and paper towels in hand, scrubbing every surface. Every item in the pantry was arranged perfectly. My former slobby baby brother who once left a tuna sandwich under his bed until it was green and fuzzy was a clean freak beyond anything I could possibly imagine. He couldn\u2019t relax, his brainwiring tripped into hyper-awareness. He had hurt his back while on duty overseas, and the new pills the doctor prescribed were the only things that seemed to calm him down. The pills were oxycontin, a pain drug once reserved only for end-of-life cancer cases. But there was \u201cnew evidence\u201d that showed that Americans were drastically undertreated for pain and a famous study showed that \u201cless than 1% of opioid users become addicted to the drugs.\u201d That \u201cstudy\u201d was actually only a single paragraph of a letter written in a 1980 medical journal by two doctors, Porter & Jick. That single paragraph\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with an insanely aggressive marketing campaign\u200a\u2014\u200alaunched a generation of new junkies, people suffering from physical ailments that were easier to focus on than their untreatable deep unease over diminishing job prospects and 2008-era financial worries. The drugs took hold in Larry, a man who had rarely even finished a beer before. As he began to take more and more, life took a turn none of us saw coming: our younger brother Myke found his way out of decades of heroin and jail. For a brief moment, Myke\u2019s rise and Larry\u2019s decline crossed as they invested together in a tattoo parlor Myke started. Myke went on to greater and greater success, and Larry just sunk deeper. Larry tried to get another job in law enforcement but suspected he was black-balled because of the whistle-blower lawsuit he had launched before he left for Iraq. His identity, which had always been as a law-and-order man, was gone and he floundered for something, anything to shore him up. Bad decisions on every front\u200a\u2014\u200afinancial, relationship\u200a\u2014\u200afollowed. The fall was swift. Larry rarely expressed remorse, moving as headstrong into destruction as he had into everything else he had done his whole life. Cyndi left, preserving herself and protecting their son. Larry tried to keep the house and moved in roommates but eventually had to let it go. We all worried about the environment Larry was exposing his son to, and the decisions he was making. At one point I called him, furious because I heard that he was keeping a live rattlesnake in a glass coffee table enclosure in a small rental house he was sharing with a new very young girlfriend. He promised me he would let it go, but told me he had it under control and I was silly to worry about it. We felt helpless to catch his fall, to stop this man who had always been so headstrong from moving full-force to destroying his whole life. His children grew bitter and one day, I got a frantic phone call from Cyndi, begging me to confront Larry. She was certain he was using drugs\u200a\u2014\u200anot just oxycontin\u200a\u2014\u200abut something much stronger. She said he was thin beyond recognition and she knew it was just a matter of time until he died. Myke had by this time built a remarkable life for himself\u200a\u2014\u200aand was one of the most well-respected celebrity tattoo artists in the US. His meteoric rise had been centered around his determination to help others climb out of the darkness he had lived in\u200a\u2014\u200ahis remarkable story inspired legions of fans and he personally reached out and helped hundreds get clean. But Larry, still holding on to his image as the law-and-order good son, refused to admit he had a problem. This next part went both so very slowly and much too quickly\u200a\u2014\u200aand will be familiar to anyone who has ever struggled with a family member caught in addiction: scenes of all of us begging Larry to get help, texting him frequently offering rehab, flying into town to confront him, arguing with my mother and sister about whether he was using prescription drugs or meth or heroin, watching him descend further and further down. One of the last times I saw Larry\u200a\u2014\u200aover three years ago now\u2014 I cried and said goodbye. The once 250 pound man was now a skeleton. His front teeth were gone. He terrified me. And it saddened me to my core because I thought he was a dead man walking, because he was much too proud to ever face what he had become. He would not be shaken enough by his condition to ever get clean, because he would deny it forever. He finally admitted he was on too many prescription drugs but nothing stronger. He was shaken by my tearful goodbye, enough to go to his doctor and tell him that he wanted to \u201ccut down\u201d on the prescription meds. I know only because he called me and put the entire exchange on speaker phone. But I knew that was just for show, to try to prove that he wasn\u2019t a street drug criminal and convince me that he was still the good son. Even without teeth and weighing a fraction of a normal weight, he was still trying to manage my impression of him. As anyone who has dealt with this knows, it only ends in one of two places: death or prison. Last Friday, I landed from a trip to Europe to a text from Myke, with a link to a news story. And this is as far as this story goes for now. Caught with stolen guns and meth\u200a\u2014\u200aand facing many many years behind bars. I don\u2019t know details beyond what I read online. What we do know is that the address where the guns were stolen was down the street from Larry\u2019s old house. He knew the man who owned them. My brother is technically not deceased. But I feel as though the person he once was isn\u2019t recognizable as the man in that photo. To have such a dramatic reversal of circumstance is like a death in many ways. It is shocking and sickening and sad. I am deeply sorry for the pain he has caused\u200a\u2014\u200aand for the pain he is clearly in. I would do anything to change what has happened and make everything right for him, his family, the people affected by the monster he has become. I was not planning to write anything about this because I know it hurts his kids to know how public this has already become in their small hometown. But when I read the articles about him\u200a\u2014\u200aand made the terrible mistake of clicking down to read the comments\u200a\u2014\u200aI needed to respond to the people who casually typed things like \u201cDeport this scum\u201d or \u201cThis guy should be shot 39 times.\u201d Behind every one of these stories of a terrible fall into addiction is someone who once had dreams and hopes and plans just like yours. He is a brother, a father, was once a cherished husband. He is still a much loved son by a mother who has had her heart broken more than once by the children she raised. His is a story of a fall from grace, pride, addiction, pharma corporate greed, American ambition, military aggression, small town politics, economic depression, few options due to lack of education, and more. It\u2019s a story of far too many people now, one of our particular time in history. But it\u2019s also the story of a single human life, a person I love and mourn with every fiber of my heart. He\u2019s not just another junkie on the street, a skeleton without a conscience. None of them are. Somewhere in there, in those sad clouded hazel eyes, my brother is alive. And for now, I\u2019m speaking for him until maybe one day, he\u2019ll speak again for himself.
