I\u2019ve thought lately that the whole \u2018launch\u2019 model of getting your work out into the world has jumped the shark. It\u2019s still happening, it\u2019s probably still working for some people, but it just seems on it\u2019s way out. Over. Done. Kaput. There seems to be a pretty incredible trend right now of creators of all stripes offering super high-quality content for free. Like, crazy high quality, high value content. The kind of thing that not very long ago would have cost a good chunk of money. After you got roughly three dozen emails from three dozen different affiliate folks about the thing. As someone who creates things, I\u2019m really excited about this trend toward generosity. It flies in the face of the idea that people won\u2019t value something they don\u2019t pay for or that you\u2019re devaluing yourself if you don\u2019t charge for every single thing you do. I thought I\u2019d share two things that I signed up for recently, that I think are completely mind blowing. And free. ConvertKit\u2019s Product Creation Masterclass In early 2016 I decided to start a new blog. I\u2019m a fiction writer who had a less than perfect experience with traditional publishing. I was ready to write again and I knew that this time I needed to work toward building an audience for my next book. I also had this idea for a class to teach other people who to write novels. And I had a day job I hated, bone deep. I started with ConvertKit. They made it easy to manage my list as it grew (very quickly. I had 800 people by the end of month one.) And they gave me a way to release my class, even though I had no idea what I was doing. I earned $80,000 last year. And I quit that day job. ConvertKit\u2019s class is four weeks long and starts April 24. Here\u2019s how they describe it: What is the Product Creation Masterclass? I\u2019m in. If you want to be, too, you can sign up here. Sean McCabe\u2019s List Building\u00a0Class Last fall I went to Jeff Goins\u2019 Tribe Writer\u2019s Conference in Nashville. While I was there, I met Sean McCabe. He is seriously one of the most talented, generous people I\u2019ve ever come in contact with. He spent more than an hour talking to me at the Frothy Monkey in downtown Franklin, TN about membership sites and how they work and whether or not one would work for me. I was pretty excited when I saw that he\u2019d put together a class all about audience building. Because Sean doesn\u2019t do ANYTHING halfway, it\u2019s full of great information. If you\u2019re just getting started with email list building, you should definitely sign up right here. This one is ongoing, as far as I can tell. No deadlines. Okay, three\u00a0things. I figure, if I\u2019m going to talk about free stuff, I might as well give my own free thing away. If you\u2019re a fiction writer, you can sign up for my class: How to Develop + Test a Story Idea. It\u2019ll take you through the steps for building a road map through your story, then testing the idea to make sure it will hold up a whole novel. Shaunta Grimes is a writer and teacher.
