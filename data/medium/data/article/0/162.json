Harness Small Wins for\u00a0Momentum Researchers Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer once analysed 12,000 journal entries of over 200 knowledge workers at seven different companies. They presented their findings in The Progress Principle, published with the Harvard Business Review Press, and they found a particularly striking trend. They observed that one of the most significant predictors of well-being at work was the idea of small wins.

Momentum is what drives the process ahead, and to be truly effective, it needs a consistent dose of fuel. Well-distributed small wins provide exactly that. Record and Measure to Visualize Progress The easiest and most effective thing you can do is record and measure. By simply tracking and documenting where you\u2019ve been, you can visualize the chain of growth nurtured from the marginal steps taken over time. Sometimes, with marginal gains, precisely because they make the larger goal more bearable, it can be difficult to see if they\u2019re getting us anywhere.
