Then your brain clicks, and you stop \u201cdriving\u201d it. Within minutes, you stop \u201criding\u201d it. You just go where you want to go.

I very, very rarely go that fast. I just match whatever walking speed I need to for the people around me. I\u2019ve gotten more comments from onlookers in New York City amazed how slowly I can go, creeping around Times Square throngs. I can go any speed I want."}, {"4e59": "EXQUISITE: The precision I have is hard to describe, and for people around me who haven\u2019t seen one before, it can be hard to believe (particularly when I tell them it didn\u2019t take practice). I can do a 360\u00b0 turn in place. I can back out of a corner, turn, and continue without a stop. (When I turn it on after it\u2019s been propped against a wall while I\u2019ve been sitting, I don\u2019t even bother to guide it away from the wall; I just hop on, turn in place, and ride away.)"}, {"69a9": "I can stay in place talking to someone for minutes. (Its battery life is many hours with normal use, and it uses \u201cregenerative braking\u201d, meaning rather than traditional brakes, it just sends power back to the battery to stop.) I can navigate a narrow NYC drugstore with a basket, go through the checkout line, pay, and leave without stepping off. Its width is less than my own elbow-to-elbow, so anywhere I can go, it can go. I have to find wheelchair ramps and elevators, but besides that I can pretty much go anywhere. And when I run into a curb without a ramp, its under-30-pound weight makes it possible to just step off and lift it up the curb."}, {"a1d8": "I went to a conference last December with the Segway. It was just like being able-bodied\u200a\u2014\u200aI could mingle at cocktail parties, navigate through densely-packed tables, go through the buffet line, carry drinks."}, {"ce52": "It was thrilling and freeing. It was worlds better than crutches, even my expensive custom set\u200a\u2014\u200amy hands were free, I didn\u2019t have to watch where I planted them, and I wasn\u2019t exhausted at the end of the day."}, {"d02e": "This scooter I\u2019d just rented was nothing like that."}, {"dfd9": "I felt humiliated and burdensome, again and\u00a0again."}, {"d8cc": "The scooter was clunky as hell. It was the kind you see on commercials and in grocery stores: one front wheel connected to a tiller, two back wheels, with a cushy chair mounted on a big platform in between. It had handlebars with a lever in the middle. The lever had basically three speeds: forward, stop, and reverse. There was a dial in the middle you needed a second hand for to control the speed. But it wasn\u2019t natural to hold on to it all the time, so it tended to be something I\u2019d adjust when circumstances changed."}, {"4c00": "A fancier scooter than the rental, but same basic idea. (\u00a9Zdlpwebb CC-BY SA\u00a04.0)"}, {"cb14": "Unfortunately, it was hard to remember I didn\u2019t have any analog control with that drive lever. To get over the door jam into my cabin, I had to have the throttle dialed up pretty high\u200a\u2014\u200abut then I needed to remember to turn the dial way down once I\u2019d cleared it, otherwise I\u2019d crash headlong into the sofa. Which I did, repeatedly. And I ran over my husband\u2019s foot at least twice doing just that. The obvious thing\u200a\u2014\u200aletting go of the pressure on the lever like it was a gas pedal\u200a\u2014\u200adid nothing to slow it down until it would suddenly stop."}, {"b37c": "I needed help with doors. I couldn\u2019t turn around in the narrow ship passageways\u200a\u2014\u200aif I overshot my destination, I had to continue all the way to the next bank of elevators and turn around. I never mastered turning in reverse."}, {"eb2a": "It had a basket I could carry things in, but I needed both hands to drive it, so even carrying a drink ten feet or getting my own food was impossible, or something I\u2019d have to hobble on my cane to do."}, {"6583": "All week, I felt like a burden on my husband and an inconvenience to other passengers and the crew. I kept making other passengers miss elevators, because I couldn\u2019t get out and clear fast enough before the doors shut. Places with two or three steps\u200a\u2014\u200aplaces I could have easily stepped off the Segway and guided it manually over\u200a\u2014\u200awere insurmountable obstacles with the scooter\u2019s 150-pound weight."}, {"7b9b": "A couple times, I \u201cturtled\u201d it going over a hatchway ramp, both its front and rear wheels in the air. It was so heavy that the only way I could get it free the time this happened and I was alone was to get off it, put all my weight on the chair back with my elbows, turn the throttle to max and hit the drive button so it would jump over\u2014 very nearly crushing my fingers against a bulkhead in the process."}, {"fc88": "I never felt safe with the thing. When I\u2019m around small children with the Segway, I\u2019m careful\u2014but only to avoid startling them or their parents, I\u2019ve never had the slightest worry of hurting them. On the scooter, I had a couple close calls with children too little to see in my blind spot that left me shaken."}, {"9a21": "We couldn\u2019t go on excursions we would have been able to with the Segway.

One night we found the handicapped spot in the ship\u2019s main theater, only to find the handicapped symbol on the floor covered with chairs the next night; I had to ask people to give up their seats, and then move them aside for me!

They said they\u2019d annotated my itinerary, and told me to call them back if I had \u201cany trouble boarding.\u201d The United rep then transferred me to the @TSA disability services desk to get the OK from them as well; TSA made a notation and told me who to contact if we had any trouble getting through security. TSA then sent me an email to confirm. We thought everything was taken care of. Boy, were we wrong. JoCoCruise 2017 homepage (https://jococruise.com/) We\u2019d been looking forward to this day for nearly a year. On Friday, March 3, we headed to Newark Liberty airport for our flight to San Diego, where we\u2019d embark on the JoCo Cruise\u200a\u2014\u200awhich some have described as a 7-day floating Comic-con/music festival. Some of my and my new husband Connor\u2019s favorite podcasters, musicians, authors, and artists would be there. We would have been excited even if this hadn\u2019t also just so happened to be our honeymoon. We got to the airport, checked in, and I rode the Segway to security and put it through the X-ray (TSA got the memo, apparently), took it to gate, and notified the gate agent we needed preboarding. At gate call, we were first in line, but they said we had to wait while they \u201cchecked on something\u201d. We waited while pre-boarding concluded, but then I told my husband to go ahead and board (we had first-class tickets\u200a\u2014\u200ait was our honeymoon, remember\u200a\u2014\u200aso he had boarding priority even without me), in order to save overhead room for the Segway with a bag. I waited as they finished priority boarding and had proceeded through the next couple boarding groups, then the agent said I couldn\u2019t carry it on, and I couldn\u2019t gate check it, because it \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed\u201d. I asked if they\u2019d seen that notation in my itinerary. They said they had, and it indeed showed my prior call. But they said it read: \u201cpassenger was advised he would NOT be allowed to board with device, and the device will not have to be checked, provided he can place device in overhead without crew assistance. Transferred passenger to TSA for clearance of device through security.\u201d It seemed obvious that the \u201cnot\u201d there was a typo\u200a\u2014\u200athe rest of the annotation doesn\u2019t make any sense otherwise! I tried to explain that logic to them, but they were unyielding. So I called the Special Needs desk and the rep reviewed the record and agreed, that was just a typo, I could carry it on. I handed my phone to the agent. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow hoverboards, they\u2019re fire risks\u2026 We don\u2019t even allow Samsung phones, we definitely won\u2019t allow\u00a0that.\u201d After speaking to the rep, the gate agent said a \u201cmanager\u201d had to decide. We waited a bit\u2014by this time, everyone in the gate area had boarded\u2014then the manager came and said no. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow hoverboards, they\u2019re fire risks.\u201d I explained that it\u2019s a Segway, not a hoverboard, it\u2019s UL-certified for fire safety (with a hologram-seal certification on bottom stating this\u200a\u2014\u200aI showed it to them), and one has never spontaneously combusted like those cheap hoverboards everyone was buying a couple years ago did. You could buy one on Amazon, even after they announced they wouldn\u2019t sell hoverboards anymore. The manager was unswayed. \u201cWe don\u2019t even allow Samsung phones, we definitely won\u2019t allow that.\u201d (I did not point out that I hadn\u2019t seen anyone asked to show their phone at the gate, and so how did he know there wasn\u2019t a Samsung phone on board?) I got my iPad out where I\u2019d pre-loaded the regs from United\u2019s own website and showed them the relevant passages: \u201cno watt hour limit\u201d for such sealed permanent batteries\u00b9, \u201cSegways\u201d for mobility purposes were specifically mentioned along with wheelchairs, scooters, etc. \u201cTSA has no problem with it.\u201d He conferred with the TSA manager, who repeated, \u201cTSA will\u00a0allow.\u201d The manager tried to make it TSA\u2019s problem. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they let you through security, TSA doesn\u2019t allow these.\u201d So I asked for the duty manager TSA\u2019s disability line told me to ask for. He shortly arrived and succinctly gave his judgment: \u201cTSA has no problem with it.\u201d The United manager scowled, and said the captain must decide. My husband returned from the plane, saying there was space saved in the overhead for it. The captain came to the gate, I explained the situation and showed him the iPad, told him it\u2019s our honeymoon and we had a cruise ship to catch, and he said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure this out,\u201d warmly\u200a\u2014\u200aI thought he was on our side. He conferred with the TSA manager, who repeated, \u201cTSA will allow.\u201d The captain returned to plane without speaking to us, and I think I\u2019m all set, so we head to the jetway\u200a\u2014\u200aand got stopped again. At this point I got a phone notification from one of my travel apps (not United\u2019s)\u200a\u2014\u200athe flight\u2019s now delayed 10 minutes (boarding began on-time). The reason given: \u201ca passenger disturbance\u201d. They\u2019re just holding my husband and me there, and making preps to push off\u200a\u2014\u200awith our luggage, including carry-ons, on the plane! I\u2019m then told that the captain has made the decision NOT to allow it, and has \u201cfinal authority\u201d. I ask what can I do\u200a\u2014\u200agate-check it? No, it\u2019s not being allowed on the plane period, cabin or cargo. Can we book another flight while we argue our case? No\u200a\u2014\u200ano flight will arrive in time for our ship departure.\u00b2 \u201cWhat if I just left it right here,\u201d in front of the gate\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwill you let us board without\u00a0it?\u201d No time to get the Segway home, or to get a friend to pick it up; no way to store it. Connor even tried without success to get an agent going off-duty to just take it to lost and found. Finally, as they\u2019re about to close the doors (were they really going to push off with all our things onboard?), I pointed to it and said \u201cwhat if I just left it right here,\u201d in front of the gate\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwill you let us board without it?\u201d The gate agent grumbles that we could\u2019ve done that at the start without all this trouble, and then lets us board\u200a\u2014\u200ame hobbling on my cane down the jetway. We take off, and my honeymoon starts with me sobbing for an hour, my husband consoling me. I felt humiliated, like all the passengers blamed me for the delay. (One passenger a few rows back was grousing loudly, \u201centitled idiot thinks he can bring a hoverboard onto an airplane\u201d.) I assumed the Segway\u200a\u2014\u200aa device that\u2019s been essential to me for much of the last year I\u2019ve had it\u200a\u2014\u200ais lost. I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d get around onboard the ship and on excursions. Before I had the Segway, I\u2019d have at least brought crutches on a trip like this, maybe a wheelchair if my symptoms were bad enough. Now I had nothing but a cane. When we arrived in San Diego, we were able to rent a scooter for several hundred dollars (including a last-minute surcharge). Compared to the Segway\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is nimble, light, can go anywhere I can except stairs, and is stable and safe\u200a\u2014\u200athis thing was miserable. It was clunky, heavy, and dangerous. Let me quickly explain the Segway. You\u2019ve probably seen the big ones used by tourists and mall cops the world over. The miniPro (available on Amazon) is the same idea, but smaller, lighter, much less expensive\u200a\u2014\u200aand, in almost every way, better. Ninebot by Segway, http://www.segwayminipro.com/ When you turn it on, it stands straight up, balancing itself. A telescoping handle pops out the top so you can guide it around when you aren\u2019t riding it. You can step on with either foot (I do this with the help of my cane), and it beeps to let you know it\u2019s now balancing you; you step fully onto it. Then, when you lean forward, it goes forward; lean back, it stops and then goes backwards. Those cheap \u201choverboards\u201d from the 2015 craze required you to steer by shifting your weight from your left foot to your right. In a way, they do steering the same way the Segway does throttle. But the Segway ignores changes in side-to-side lean\u200a\u2014\u200aI couldn\u2019t use it otherwise, since one foot or the other is usually bothering me. Instead, you steer it by putting gentle pressure on a kneebar. The more you press, the quicker you turn. So I can use it, even if I can put little to no weight on one side. Compared to many other mobility options like that scooter rental, the Segway\u2019s control is a) intuitive, b) analog, and c) exquisite. Let me explain: INTUITIVE: I\u2019ve let friends try it. I\u2019ve let friends\u2019 kids try it. I\u2019ve let people on the sidewalk try it. I\u2019ve even once\u200a\u2014\u200acarefully!\u2014let a stranger I met on the street, who had a similar form of arthritis to mine and was walking with crutches, give it a try. It feels weird for the first ten or fifteen seconds; people tend to rock back and forth a bit, so I offer them my arm while they get used to it. Then your brain clicks, and you stop \u201cdriving\u201d it. Within minutes, you stop \u201criding\u201d it. You just go where you want to go. Like walking, you don\u2019t think about the mechanics; you just think about what you want to do, and it does it. If an obstacle suddenly appears\u200a\u2014\u200aa door opens in front of you, someone walking ahead stops abruptly to pick up something they\u2019ve dropped\u200a\u2014\u200ayour natural startle reflex, to straighten up and lean back\u200a\u2014\u200astops you, nearly instantly. When I\u2019ve had friends\u2019 kids try it, after they get the hang of it and are zooming around happily, I tell them to try passing where I\u2019m standing at full speed. Then, at the last moment, I step in front of them and put out a hand. They stop as quickly, as automatically, and with as little danger to either of us as if they were walking by and I\u2019d done the same. The point is, this thing is safe. ANALOG: At full-tilt, the Segway goes up to about 13 mph. I very, very rarely go that fast. I just match whatever walking speed I need to for the people around me. I\u2019ve gotten more comments from onlookers in New York City amazed how slowly I can go, creeping around Times Square throngs. I can go any speed I want. EXQUISITE: The precision I have is hard to describe, and for people around me who haven\u2019t seen one before, it can be hard to believe (particularly when I tell them it didn\u2019t take practice). I can do a 360\u00b0 turn in place. I can back out of a corner, turn, and continue without a stop. (When I turn it on after it\u2019s been propped against a wall while I\u2019ve been sitting, I don\u2019t even bother to guide it away from the wall; I just hop on, turn in place, and ride away.) I can stay in place talking to someone for minutes. (Its battery life is many hours with normal use, and it uses \u201cregenerative braking\u201d, meaning rather than traditional brakes, it just sends power back to the battery to stop.) I can navigate a narrow NYC drugstore with a basket, go through the checkout line, pay, and leave without stepping off. Its width is less than my own elbow-to-elbow, so anywhere I can go, it can go. I have to find wheelchair ramps and elevators, but besides that I can pretty much go anywhere. And when I run into a curb without a ramp, its under-30-pound weight makes it possible to just step off and lift it up the curb. I went to a conference last December with the Segway. It was just like being able-bodied\u200a\u2014\u200aI could mingle at cocktail parties, navigate through densely-packed tables, go through the buffet line, carry drinks. It was thrilling and freeing. It was worlds better than crutches, even my expensive custom set\u200a\u2014\u200amy hands were free, I didn\u2019t have to watch where I planted them, and I wasn\u2019t exhausted at the end of the day. This scooter I\u2019d just rented was nothing like that. I felt humiliated and burdensome, again and\u00a0again. The scooter was clunky as hell. It was the kind you see on commercials and in grocery stores: one front wheel connected to a tiller, two back wheels, with a cushy chair mounted on a big platform in between. It had handlebars with a lever in the middle. The lever had basically three speeds: forward, stop, and reverse. There was a dial in the middle you needed a second hand for to control the speed. But it wasn\u2019t natural to hold on to it all the time, so it tended to be something I\u2019d adjust when circumstances changed. A fancier scooter than the rental, but same basic idea. (\u00a9Zdlpwebb CC-BY SA\u00a04.0) Unfortunately, it was hard to remember I didn\u2019t have any analog control with that drive lever. To get over the door jam into my cabin, I had to have the throttle dialed up pretty high\u200a\u2014\u200abut then I needed to remember to turn the dial way down once I\u2019d cleared it, otherwise I\u2019d crash headlong into the sofa. Which I did, repeatedly. And I ran over my husband\u2019s foot at least twice doing just that. The obvious thing\u200a\u2014\u200aletting go of the pressure on the lever like it was a gas pedal\u200a\u2014\u200adid nothing to slow it down until it would suddenly stop. I needed help with doors. I couldn\u2019t turn around in the narrow ship passageways\u200a\u2014\u200aif I overshot my destination, I had to continue all the way to the next bank of elevators and turn around. I never mastered turning in reverse. It had a basket I could carry things in, but I needed both hands to drive it, so even carrying a drink ten feet or getting my own food was impossible, or something I\u2019d have to hobble on my cane to do. All week, I felt like a burden on my husband and an inconvenience to other passengers and the crew. I kept making other passengers miss elevators, because I couldn\u2019t get out and clear fast enough before the doors shut. Places with two or three steps\u200a\u2014\u200aplaces I could have easily stepped off the Segway and guided it manually over\u200a\u2014\u200awere insurmountable obstacles with the scooter\u2019s 150-pound weight. A couple times, I \u201cturtled\u201d it going over a hatchway ramp, both its front and rear wheels in the air. It was so heavy that the only way I could get it free the time this happened and I was alone was to get off it, put all my weight on the chair back with my elbows, turn the throttle to max and hit the drive button so it would jump over\u2014 very nearly crushing my fingers against a bulkhead in the process. I never felt safe with the thing. When I\u2019m around small children with the Segway, I\u2019m careful\u2014but only to avoid startling them or their parents, I\u2019ve never had the slightest worry of hurting them. On the scooter, I had a couple close calls with children too little to see in my blind spot that left me shaken. We couldn\u2019t go on excursions we would have been able to with the Segway. A lot of excursions can handle someone with a mobility device they can lift themselves, but very few had the people or equipment to deal with a 150-pound vehicle. And \u201ctendering\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200agetting to shore by way of little shuttle boats in ports that can\u2019t accommodate huge ships\u200a\u2014\u200awas such an ordeal, dealing with winches and tiny service elevators I had to use alone\u200a\u2014\u200awe just stayed on the ship once, giving up our only chance for a lay on the beach. It was just too much trouble. (I can and do hold the Segway in my lap in taxicabs.) It was just an awful experience. I needed help for everything. One night we found the handicapped spot in the ship\u2019s main theater, only to find the handicapped symbol on the floor covered with chairs the next night; I had to ask people to give up their seats, and then move them aside for me! I felt humiliated and burdensome, again and again. I don\u2019t want to be overly gloomy, or pretend my honeymoon wasn\u2019t any fun at all. The @JoCoCruise was fantastic otherwise, and the staff were extremely helpful. Performers I met like @JeanGreasy, @QuelleChris, @RebeccaSugar & others were sympathetic and outraged when they heard about this. I have no idea how some people heard about it, but strangers frequently stopped me to tell me how distressed they were about what had happened at the airport. I started to feel better, like this was just one of those \u201cnightmare honeymoons\u201d that couples talk about fondly decades later as something that helped them grow closer. Then, about halfway through the cruise, my cellphone briefly connected for the first time since we\u2019d left San Diego. I might be arrested on arrival at\u00a0EWR. I had a series of progressively more ominous voicemails saying I had \u201cabandoned a hazardous material at an international airport\u201d, which was a crime, and could be held \u201ccriminally and civilly liable\u201d. @HALcruises staff were helpful, and generously let me use their phones and Internet for free. But from a distance, all I could find out was that the Segway had been \u201ccontained\u201d by a hazmat team, that I might owe them lots of money for its disposal, and I might be arrested on arrival at EWR. I spent the rest of cruise terrified and stressed out. My husband got me through it; I love him so much. The other cruisers were supportive, too. Jean Grae and Quelle Chris were both particularly great; I\u2019d never met them before, but they were checking in on me regularly by the end of the cruise. When we docked in San Diego, the scooter company took the scooter from our cabin before we disembarked\u200a\u2014\u200aso we had to call for a manual wheelchair. I\u2019m not used to wheelchairs, and my husband had to handle all our luggage; going down a ramp heading towards the gangway I gained too much speed, and took a spill over some stairs. I was just scraped and winded, but it was very scary\u200a\u2014\u200aprobably more for my husband than for me. (It\u2019s really okay, honey. You did great and I love you.) Someone who saw this got a HAL crewman (the ship\u2019s IT guy!) who pushed me the rest of the way\u200a\u2014\u200awhich was a good thing, too, because we had to detour across the entire ship to get to a working elevator. We\u2019d planned a day in San Diego, but with my mobility now limited to a cane, we just went to the movies instead. We got on our flight home, arrived in EWR\u200a\u2014\u200aand, glory be!, no cops to greet me! We even got the Segway back. (The baggage desk crew seemed to know we had been wronged, I caught one whispering to another, incredulously, \u201cbut those are allowed!\u201d) I\u2019m not expecting miracles. I\u2019d just like them\u200a\u2014\u200aor another airline, if they refuse\u200a\u2014\u200ato assure me I\u2019ll be allowed to bring my mobility device with me the next time I\u00a0fly. I\u2019ve since done more research and can find no reason whatsoever that this should have happened. I did everything I was supposed to. I had the policies and regulations behind me. I\u2019ve sent a letter\u2014a real, paper letter, since I hear that gets better results\u2014to United Airlines, but so far have heard nothing. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve signed up for next year\u2019s @JoCoCruise. A do-over, perhaps\u200a\u2014\u200abut I think it shows how great the cruise is that we\u2019re already set to try again. I don\u2019t care if @United compensates me, not even for the scooter rental. An apology would be nice, but I\u2019m not expecting miracles. I\u2019d just like them\u200a\u2014\u200aor another airline, if they refuse\u200a\u2014\u200ato assure me I\u2019ll be allowed to bring my mobility device with me the next time I fly. \u2014 Note: the comments appearing below may say \u201crecommended by Trey Harris (author)\u201d.

Veteran cruisers know you don\u2019t book the last possible flight before a sailing, and we hadn\u2019t: it was the last flight of the evening before, and we had a hotel room in San Diego. The first two flights the next morning could get us there before sailing. But at that point, we had no reason to believe United would change its mind, so we needed to get to San Diego in time to buy or rent a new mobility device and get it to the port before sailing. No later flight would give us that time\u2014 we barely made it as it was.
