If he wanted to write about politics, he had to do it within the confines of a sports story. \u201cYou decide whether you think this is a lefty idea or not,\u201d said Larry Merchant, who was a columnist at the old (liberal) New York Post. \u201cI wrote a story about a horse that had ridden in the Kentucky Derby.

Starting in the 1950s, accounts of games (\u201cgamers\u201d) became less valuable when fans could watch for themselves on TV. As the game inventory on cable and then DirecTV and then the internet has exploded, gamers are less valuable than ever. Newbie sportswriters have been redeployed. \u201cThe people who in an earlier generation would be telling us what they saw are telling us what they think instead,\u201d said Josh Levin."}, {"c0aa": "The internet transformed sportswriting in another way: It made a local concern into a national one. On one level, this is pure joy: Now everyone gets to read Andy McCullough. But it also meant that reactionary opinions that may have played in St. Louis or Cincinnati are now held up for ridicule by the writers at Deadspin. I suspect a lot of sportswriters who might be right-leaning either get on the train or don\u2019t write about politics at all."}, {"2c2b": "You might argue, as Neyer does, that the old sportswriters were probably mostly left-of-center types. But without Twitter, it was difficult for anyone to know this. \u201cWhen I started doing this, in 2003, it felt a little lonely, like I was in a phone booth yelling this stuff,\u201d said The Nation\u2019s Dave Zirin. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, or have access to, a community of sportswriters who felt similarly.\u201d"}, {"7aa0": "The changes in the architecture of sportswriting also changed the profession\u2019s great dilemma.

After a slack period since Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown shuffled off the main stage, we\u2019ve finally entered the second great age of athlete activism. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 50 years of pretty much quiet,\u201d said Sandy Padwe, who wrote a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer and later became an editor at Sports Illustrated.

But within sportswriting, this is actually true. The publication of college football coaches\u2019 rapidly inflating salaries floated the anti-amateurism crusade.

There\u2019s still plenty of PED hysteria, even if it\u2019s getting better.

In 10 years, woke sportswriters will be wondering why our generation didn\u2019t talk more about it."}, {"eace": "Maybe what we\u2019re seeing is simply writers plying their trade in a different era. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t piss on things that are progress and are good,\u201d Lipsyte said. \u201cBut how much of it is really any kind of expression of liberalism?

Do you have to be liberal to call Roger Goodell a tool? So maybe it\u2019s better to put it like this: There was a time when filling your column with liberal ideas on race, class, gender, and labor policy got you dubbed a \u201csociologist.\u201d These days, such views are more likely to get you a job. Donald Trump\u2019s election was merely an accelerant for a change that was already sweeping across sportswriting. On issues that divided the big columnists for years, there\u2019s now something like a consensus. NCAA amateurism is rotten. The Washington Redskins nickname is more rotten.

A few decades ago, Taylor Branch\u2019s line that NCAA amateurism had \u201can unmistakable whiff of the plantation\u201d would have been an eye-rollingly hot take. Now, if you turned in a column comparing college football to the institution of slavery, I suspect few editors would try to talk you out of publishing it. But they might ask you to come up with something more original. As recently as the turn of the century, you could find columnists hanging Alex Rodriguez\u2019s $252 million contract around his neck. Nobody much writes about free agency like that anymore. Even a bad contract is usually called a misallocation of resources by a team rather than a manifestation of a ballplayer\u2019s overweening greed. In the new world of liberal sportswriting, athletes who dabble in political activism are covered admiringly. Last year, Slate\u2019s Josh Levin went searching for the voices who were dinging Colin Kaepernick for his national anthem protest. Levin found conservatives like Tomi Lahren and a couple of personalities from FS1. In the old days, such voices would have filled up half the sports columns, easy. (Getty Images) Institutions that made for easy off-day fodder for the writers now get increasing scrutiny. The writer Joe Sheehan has called the Major League Baseball draft \u201ca quasi-criminal enterprise that serves the powerful at the expense of the powerless.\u201d Lester Rodney would have been proud of that line. And these are just issues within sports. Look at the way sportswriters tweet about politics now. \u201cGod bless the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost,\u201d Peter King tweeted earlier this week after the papers revealed the Trump administration\u2019s web of ties to Russia. Two weeks ago, sportswriters blasted away at Trump\u2019s immigration ban\u200a\u2014\u200astaging their own pussy-hat protest within the press box. Last year, Roger Angell came out of the bullpen to endorse Hillary Clinton. The End of \u201cStick to Sports\u201dSportswriters have been awakened by Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Is that what their readers want?theringer.com \u201cHow many sportswriters have you seen on Twitter defending Donald Trump?\u201d asked the baseball writer Rob Neyer. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one. I\u2019m sure there must have been a few writers out there who did vote for him, but there\u2019s a lot of pressure not to be public about it.\u201d Forget the viability of being a Trump-friendly sportswriter today. Could someone even be a Paul Ryan\u2013friendly sportswriter\u200a\u2014\u200aknocking out their power rankings while tweeting that Obamacare is a failure and the Iran deal was a giveaway of American sovereignty? In sportswriting, there was once a social and professional price to pay for being a noisy liberal. Now, there\u2019s at least a social price to pay for being a conservative. Figuring out how the job changed\u200a\u2014\u200ahow we all became the children of Lester Rodney\u200a\u2014\u200ais one of the most fascinating questions of our age. There was always a coven of liberals in sportswriting: Shirley Povich, Dan Parker, Sam Lacy, George Kiseda, Robert Lipsyte, Wells Twombly, and the merry band known as the Chipmunks. As Roger Kahn once wrote, \u201cSports tell anyone who watches intelligently about the times in which we live: about managed news and corporate politics, about race and terror and what the process of aging does to strong men.\u201d But these idealists plied their trade in a media universe almost completely different from our own. The first reason sportswriting became a liberal profession is that the product known as \u201csportswriting\u201d has been radically altered from what it was 40, 30, even 20 years ago. The old liberal sportswriter was a prisoner of daily newspapers. If he wanted to write about politics, he had to do it within the confines of a sports story. \u201cYou decide whether you think this is a lefty idea or not,\u201d said Larry Merchant, who was a columnist at the old (liberal) New York Post. \u201cI wrote a story about a horse that had ridden in the Kentucky Derby. Now, it was in service of the national police in riot control in Washington, D.C. To me, that\u2019s the most natural story in the world!\u201d Even if a newspaper had a \u201cpolitical\u201d sports columnist, he was nearly always paired with a second, apolitical columnist, who matched the former\u2019s moral crusades with his own rigid attention to balls and strikes. \u201cWhen you treat sports as a self-contained universe into which the rest of the universe does not intrude, it will inevitably be conservative,\u201d said Craig Calcaterra. You defer to the commissioner, to the head coach, to the reserve clause\u200a\u2014\u200ato the reigning authority. The internet leveled the barrier between sportswriting and the rest of the universe. It also dropped the neutrality that was practiced by everyone but a handful of columnists. \u201cWe might have been more liberal than you would have imagined we were, but we didn\u2019t bring it in our copy, you know?\u201d said Deford. \u201cWe separated our individual lives from what we wrote because that was what was expected.\u201d This loosening of the prose was hastened along by a technological change. Starting in the 1950s, accounts of games (\u201cgamers\u201d) became less valuable when fans could watch for themselves on TV. As the game inventory on cable and then DirecTV and then the internet has exploded, gamers are less valuable than ever. Newbie sportswriters have been redeployed. \u201cThe people who in an earlier generation would be telling us what they saw are telling us what they think instead,\u201d said Josh Levin. The internet transformed sportswriting in another way: It made a local concern into a national one. On one level, this is pure joy: Now everyone gets to read Andy McCullough. But it also meant that reactionary opinions that may have played in St. Louis or Cincinnati are now held up for ridicule by the writers at Deadspin. I suspect a lot of sportswriters who might be right-leaning either get on the train or don\u2019t write about politics at all. You might argue, as Neyer does, that the old sportswriters were probably mostly left-of-center types. But without Twitter, it was difficult for anyone to know this. \u201cWhen I started doing this, in 2003, it felt a little lonely, like I was in a phone booth yelling this stuff,\u201d said The Nation\u2019s Dave Zirin. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, or have access to, a community of sportswriters who felt similarly.\u201d The changes in the architecture of sportswriting also changed the profession\u2019s great dilemma. For a century, even sportswriters who had curious minds felt the narcotic pull of the toy department. (It took the carnage of the \u201968 Democratic National Convention to shock Red Smith into consciousness.) Then\u200a\u2014\u200aonce woke\u200a\u2014\u200athe sportswriter faced a second problem: What do I do? Try to sneak politics into my column? Abandon the good salary and Marriott points offered by sportswriting to do \u201creal work\u201d on the front page? In the Twitter era, I suspect most sportswriters don\u2019t feel this dilemma very keenly or even at all. As the world burns, they turn in their power rankings and then they tweet about Trump. There were other tractor beams that pulled sportswriting to the left. After a slack period since Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown shuffled off the main stage, we\u2019ve finally entered the second great age of athlete activism. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 50 years of pretty much quiet,\u201d said Sandy Padwe, who wrote a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer and later became an editor at Sports Illustrated. The new wave of activism \u201cis not like the \u201960s by any means,\u201d Padwe said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a hell of an improvement.\u201d (Getty Images) Activism smuggles liberalism into sportswriting\u200a\u2014\u200anot as opinion but as news. Whatever his politics, the sportswriter must report Gregg Popovich\u2019s lecture on white privilege; Steph Curry calling Trump an \u201cass\u201d; and a handful of the Super Bowl\u2013winning Patriots refusing to go to Trump\u2019s White House. Mr. Bennett Does Not Go to WashingtonSome Patriots say they won\u2019t visit the White House\u200a\u2014\u200abut the ceremony means more to Trump than to the teamtheringer.com It\u2019s not only athlete activism that has rejiggered sportswriting but the athletes\u2019 increased power. In the \u201960s, a sportswriter who merely wanted to be a stenographer to the powerful would cozy up to the league commissioner or owner. Now\u200a\u2014\u200aafter the explosion in player salaries and the voice granted by Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200athe same power seeker is more likely to cozy up to LeBron James, or his agent. As Lester Rodney would tell you, when you\u2019re covering sports from the workers\u2019 point of view instead of management\u2019s, the trade inevitably moves to the left. Non-sports types like Taylor Branch have given the industry a much-needed noogie. Branch\u2019s 2011 article in The Atlantic transformed the crusade against NCAA amateurism from one often neglected in the sports press into one that burned up the New York Times op-ed page. \u201cIt makes sense that a hometown sports page is not going to get into this,\u201d Branch said. \u201cTheir job is to feed the appetite of the sports fan. This is a fly on their dessert.\u201d Deford told me: \u201cI kill myself when I think that when I ran The National neither I nor the bright people on that paper thought we really ought to examine the NCAA. We never said that. We just accepted that. We took it at face value. We should be ashamed of it.\u201d If liberals have a long-standing delusion, it\u2019s that the presentation of hard data (about everything from climate change to \u201cvoter fraud\u201d) will win the masses to their cause. But within sportswriting, this is actually true. The publication of college football coaches\u2019 rapidly inflating salaries floated the anti-amateurism crusade. If you know that the NBA signed a $24 billion TV deal with ESPN and Turner, it\u2019s hard to argue that even Timofey Mozgov\u2019s contract is going to bankrupt the league. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulation of evidence rather than political change,\u201d said Bruce Arthur, who writes a column for the Toronto Star. \u201cPeople just figured it out.\u201d There are chance events too. The fact that Dan Snyder hasn\u2019t put many winning Redskins teams on the field has the side effect of undermining support for the team\u2019s nickname\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cIf Snyder\u2019s for it,\u201d people think, \u201chow can I not be against it?\u201d Similarly, Roger Goodell\u2019s mishandling of issues like Deflategate suggests that he might be mishandling player safety too. Donald Trump\u2019s election changed sports Twitter into a frisky episode of All In With Chris Hayes. But here, sportswriters are probably being radicalized at roughly the same rate as the rest of the electorate\u200a\u2014\u200aa process that began during George W. Bush\u2019s administration and continued apace through the Obama years. If most Democrats you know seem feistier than they did 20 years ago, it follows that sportswriters would too. Talk to the real lefties within sportswriting\u200a\u2014\u200aLipsyte, Padwe\u200a\u2014\u200aand you find they\u2019re skeptical that we\u2019re witnessing a genuine ideological conversion. Sportswriters rarely touch issues like the antitrust exemption and the flag-waving militarism that drenches pro sports. (See Fox\u2019s Super Bowl pregame show for one recent example.) There\u2019s still plenty of PED hysteria, even if it\u2019s getting better. The idea that league drafts unfairly conscript players to teams feels like an issue that\u2019s just starting to get mainstream traction. In 10 years, woke sportswriters will be wondering why our generation didn\u2019t talk more about it. Maybe what we\u2019re seeing is simply writers plying their trade in a different era. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t piss on things that are progress and are good,\u201d Lipsyte said. \u201cBut how much of it is really any kind of expression of liberalism? How much is times change and we change with it? Maybe we\u2019re just standing in the same place but being carried along by the flow.\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s Greatest Weapon Was SportsHow the president used his love of the game to further his endgametheringer.com The Obama administration was a dream time for liberal sportswriters, who had a president who talked about sports like they did. Trump\u2019s election caused a convulsion. Lipsyte added, \u201cKaepernick, the manifestos of Melo and LeBron, and the Trumpish tinge to the Patriots and its reaction from players who say they won\u2019t go to the White House have to be acknowledged, and once you do that, it feels like left-leaning commentary. Unless, of course, it is.\u201d On November 8, we learned a lot of Americans aren\u2019t ready to sail into the progressive horizon. In sportswriting, as in politics, there was a backlash that you could see across the media. First, conservative political writers began grumbling about their sports pages the way they grumble about the front pages. A 2014 American Spectator column sniffed: \u201c[The sportswriter] now lies prostrate before a new set of masters: Mimosa-sipping Manhattanites and liberal witch hunters whose sole interest in sports is purging football teams of offensive names, obtaining equal screen-time for females, and celebrating sexual diversity.\u201d Equal time and diversity\u200a\u2014\u200awhat a crock. Next, other sportswriters took up the critique. \u201cThe sports media is the most far-left contingent of media that exists in this country,\u201d Fox Sports\u2019 Clay Travis declared last month. In tsk-tsking the writers\u200a\u2014\u200aand the athletes they worship\u200a\u2014\u200athe holdouts sounded like the founders of Fox News. Your media\u2019s been hijacked! Those who are sitting out the liberal sportswriting renaissance are as likely to tweak the media as they are to offer competing ideas. This week, when Nike released an \u201cEquality\u201d ad starring LeBron James and Serena Williams, Jason Whitlock said: \u201call this \u2018resist, resist\u2019\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s bogus. It\u2019s a campaign.\u00a0\u2026 It ain\u2019t got a damn thing to do with you, the ordinary working man.\u201d Earlier this year, when Ronda Rousey was throttled by Amanda Nunes, Travis said: \u201cThere were a ton of people in the sports media who wanted Ronda Rousey to be good because it somehow represented their belief that women are better than men.\u201d Breitbart approvingly cited the remark. (Getty Images) In a world where liberal sportswriters predominate, there\u2019s a second economic opportunity. You create a \u201csafe space\u201d where sports and politics don\u2019t intermingle, where readers aren\u2019t just excused for not being woke but are rewarded for it. On one of the recent Barstool Rundown TV specials, Dave Portnoy said the immigration protests that were filling airports were \u201cprobably the no. 1 story for people [who are] not us\u00a0\u2026 real-world issues that we don\u2019t care at all about.\u201d Then Portnoy cut to footage of a reader\u200a\u2014\u200aa Stoolie\u200a\u2014\u200awho\u2019d arrived on a flight from Istanbul while the protests were raging. The Stoolie pretended to be a refugee who\u2019d made it through customs and marched through the terminal, soaking up the applause of the crowd. If there was ever a more backhanded indictment of sports Twitter, I\u2019d love to see it. What about me? If it hasn\u2019t seeped into the preceding paragraphs, I\u2019m a liberal sportswriter myself. The new world suits me just fine. Would it be nice to have a David Frum or Ross Douthat of sportswriting, making wrongheaded-but-interesting arguments about NCAA amateurism? Sure. As long as nobody believed them. If anything has gone haywire in this new world, it\u2019s the problem of Leo Durocher\u2019s cap. Writers trying to find the proper, liberal response to new issues wind up tying themselves in knots. Take the reaction to the Ray Rice video in 2014. There was a hue and cry throughout sportswriting: Something ought to be done! (If there was any criticism, it came from the left: that replays of the elevator video were \u201cre-victimizing\u201d his then-fianc\u00e9e, Janay.) Unfortunately, many of the early columns didn\u2019t always say who ought to do something or what it should be. Roger Goodell used the groundswell of rage to suspend Rice indefinitely and increase his already-fearsome power over player discipline. Such imprecision doesn\u2019t just empower hardliners like Goodell. A few months after Rice\u2019s suspension, Adam Silver, the model of a progressive commissioner, used a gray area in his league\u2019s CBA to levy a harsh punishment against a convicted domestic abuser, Jeffery Taylor. Silver attributed his actions to what he called the \u201cevolving social consensus\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amuch of which was crafted in the media. And there\u2019s another liberal ideal at stake here: that criminals who\u2019ve paid their debt to society ought to have a chance to re-enter it. In 2010, Barack Obama congratulated the owner of the Eagles for giving Michael Vick a job after he was released from prison. Rice\u2019s bad acts were very different from Vick\u2019s. But say Rice got another NFL job after his apology tour. Would a sportswriter have written an encomium to the owner who signed Rice? Should they have? It\u2019s an awfully tough question. I bet old Lester Rodney would have smiled when told the headaches he faced at The Daily Worker are now racking sportswriters from the L.A. Times to SB Nation. For this is what happens when revolutionary ideas become a ruling philosophy\u200a\u2014\u200awhen the former insurgents get the run of the place.
