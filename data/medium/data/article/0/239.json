If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any market, against any competition.

Patrick Lencioni told a leadership tale in his book about how Kathryn, the new CEO of a once-promising but now-failing company, managed to bring the unconsciously dysfunctional executive team into a cohesive and effective team, to illustrate an actionable model which is applicable to any team. I thought it\u2019s worth sharing, if you haven\u2019t got time to read the original. 1. Absence of\u00a0Trust The word trust is used so often and in so many ways that it has lost its impact. You often hear people say: \u201cI trust my coworkers so I don\u2019t question how they do their job\u201d, \u201cI trust my boss so I followed his order without question\u201d, \u201cI trust him implicitly and I\u2019m ready to go to bat for him any time\u201d\u00a0\u2026\u2026 but these stand in contrast to the type of trust an effective team needs.

The only way to do that is to overcome our need for invulnerability.

If we can\u2019t learn to engage in passionate, unfiltered debate about what we need to do to succeed, we are through. Team meetings and movies have lots in common. What makes a movie interesting?

Team Assessment: During team meetings, are the most important\u200a\u2014\u200aand difficult\u200a\u2014\u200aissues put on the table to be resolved? 3. Lack of commitment The evidence of this one is ambiguity. When people don\u2019t unload their opinion and feel like they\u2019ve been listened to (due to fear of conflict), they won\u2019t really get on board. This is not consensus. Consensus is horrible. Because it\u2019s rare everyone really agrees on something naturally and quickly, consensus becomes an attempt to please everyone, which usually turns into displeasing everyone equally.

You may have worked with managers who like to describe any sensitive decision as \u201cEveryone is happy with\u201d. Are they the effective and confident managers, or the opposite? 4. Avoidance of Accountability The evidence is low standard. It\u2019s not easy to hold someone accountable. Some people are hard to hold accountable because they are so helpful. Others because they get defensive. Others because they are intimidating. People decide to tolerate peers on issues which matter, to avoid the interpersonal discomfort. While managers may not have as much of problem to hold direct reports accountable, it\u2019s harder with peers, because \u201cWe are supposed to be equals, and who am I to stick my nose into their business?\u201d More importantly, when there was no buy-in and commitment in the first place, it seems pointless, people would just say \u201cI never agreed to that anyway\u201d. (Some managers may say \u201cI just consider each team member has his own job, I let them be accountable for their own area, and I help them on one-on-one basis when I could.\u201d) Okay, imagine a basketball coach at half-time. He calls each player to his office one-on-one about the first half, without letting any of them knowing what everyone else was talking about. That\u2019s not a team. It\u2019s a collection of individuals. Once the team achieves clarity and buy-in, then we have to hold each other accountable for what we sign up to do, for high standards of performance and behavior. Push with respect, and under the assumption that the other person is probably doing the right thing. But push anyway. And never hold back. 5. Inattention to\u00a0results The evidence is ego and politics. There\u2019s a reason that sports are so prevalent when it comes to teamwork, the score at the end of the game that determines if you won or lost, there\u2019s little room for interpretation or ego-driven success. The key is to define goals for the team in a simply measurable way which leaves no room for interpretation when it comes to success. Otherwise it only creates the opportunity for individual ego to sneak in. And that\u2019s where politics prevail. Many of us have had experience with organizations which emphasize effort over result. People take pride in fighting fires than preventing fire in the first place. The incentive to improve efficiency and quality is lost, the game to preserve the illusion of long working hours is on. The next things gone are the competitive edge and team morale. The politics around here are astounding, and they are a result of everyone being far too ambiguous about what we are trying to accomplish, and that makes it easy to focus on individual success. Kathryn\u2019s observation shocked everyone in the team, they thought she went too far this time to say they are political. One of them had to ask \u201cWhat do you mean by politics?\u201d Politics is when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they really think. Then it started to sink in. Team Assessment: Does the failure to achieve team goals affect morale significantly? Or does everyone just think it\u2019s not his fault? It\u2019s a\u00a0journey. During the next two weeks I\u2019m going to be pretty intolerant of behavior that demonstrates an absence of trust, or focus on individual ego. I will be encouraging conflict, driving for clear commitments, and expecting all of you to hold each other accountable. I\u2019ll be calling out bad behavior when I see it, and I\u2019d like to see you doing the same. We don\u2019t have time to waste. After weeks of quiet observation followed by a team building phase, Kathryn laid out the ground rules. On the way to shedding their dysfunctions, plenty of groups slide backward. The journey is about having the discipline and persistence to keep doing what we started to do. The signs of progress in the eyes of a new member who just joined Kathryn\u2019s renewed team: Joseph was new to the staff meeting.
