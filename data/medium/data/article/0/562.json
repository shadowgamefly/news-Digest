Well, should\u00a0we? No one tells you how to act in an awkward situation. I get uncomfortable enough watching tense moments on TV that I have to look down at my phone and pretend like it\u2019s not happening. That\u2019s probably why most of us couldn\u2019t look at Alliance\u2019s picture (pronounced Ah-lee-onz) for more than a few moments without glancing around the room. The young man on the screen was a student when he was arrested and tortured by the Burundi Secret Police. Alliance had run a student group that openly opposed some of the Burundi government\u2019s policies. He was just a kid really, so I imagined the story was going to be about how they roughed up some 18-year-old and put the fear-of-God in him. Instead, they arrested him. Then they ordered him to change his position and influence the other members of his student group to change their views as well. When he refused, that\u2019s when the torture began.

This process continued for five days until they dumped his body next to a local river so that the crocodiles would consume his corpse. He miraculously survived.
