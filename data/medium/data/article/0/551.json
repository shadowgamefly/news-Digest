It\u2019s finals week, and I\u2019ve dragged her away from a study session to come have an early dinner with me. Ivy is days away from the end of her first year, I\u2019m one final away from the end of my second.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve been dating two months, and it\u2019s a passionate, dramatic mess.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way to pizza, we pass Wooster Hall, the architecture building. I glance towards the doors, half-hoping to see him. For the first time in seven months, I do. Thuy has his back to me, a blousy white oxford tucked into blue short shorts, an artist\u2019s portfolio under his arm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recognize him by the nape of his strangely long neck, the golden inches between the squared-off hairline and his collar. I stop.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ivy asks, and then follows my gaze. We stare at Thuy together. Ivy sighs. \u201cI really, really don\u2019t need this now, Hugo. Come on.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She tugs, and I start to move. Thuy presumably senses our stares, turns. He studies me for a minute, and then gives a slow, almost sarcastic shrug. \u201cWhat the fuck, Hugo?\u201d the shoulders ask.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only man I\u2019ve ever called my boyfriend seems in agreement with the woman who\u2019ll be my girlfriend for two more days. Time to move on, Hugo.\u00a0\u00a0August 1986. I meet Thuy at a Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Alliance mixer. It is the first week of my sophomore year, and I\u2019ve come back to Cal having made the conscious decision to try to date men. I\u2019m finally over my first girlfriend, April. I\u2019ve slept with a couple of other women, but those hookups haven\u2019t turned into anything.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m more frustrated that I keep falling in love with women I can\u2019t have, like good female friends who already have boyfriends. I mope a lot.\u00a0\u00a0At 19, I\u2019ve had sex with 50 times more men than women, but almost all those men have been much older than me. Almost all were paying me. Only a few wanted to date me, and of those there wasn\u2019t one who interested me emotionally. Deep down, I\u2019ve assumed I could never love a man the way I love a woman. I\u2019d like to try, I think\u200a\u2014\u200aif only because the pain of these unrequited crushes on women is so wretched.\u00a0\u00a0I already know I like sex with men. I don\u2019t imagine I could ever be in love with a man the way I can be with women, but perhaps, as my mother puts it, I can find with a man a flame strong enough to warm the house, but not fiery enough to burn it down. I already know women burn my house down."}, {"95a8": "Thuy walks up to me the moment I step into the mixer, introducing himself with casual ease. He\u2019s maybe 5\u20199\u201d, a slight accent, glasses, and adorable mod haircut. My first thought, which proves correct, is that with that look, he must ride a Vespa. My second thought is that he\u2019s very cute.\u00a0\u00a0We grab sodas and talk. Thuy is a year older than I am, an architecture major from Orange County. Born in Vietnam, his family made it out in 1975, when Thuy was nine. Eleven years later, he carries the hopes of a family who would disown him if they knew he was gay. He tells me his older sister suspects, and tried to get one of her friends to seduce him in hopes of effecting a conversion. It is a comic story tinged with heartbreak, and he tells it well.\u00a0\u00a0We leave the mixer and walk through campus. It is an unusually warm night, even for August, and we\u2019re both sweating from the heat and excitement. I\u2019m wearing the dreadfully commonplace Drakkar; his cologne is something I don\u2019t recognize. I think about asking him, but don\u2019t. What I really want to do is bury my nose in his neck and breathe it in, taste it.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t have to wait long. It is nearly dark, and as we walk past the west side of Dwinelle Hall, Thuy grabs my wrist and deftly maneuvers me against a wall. I have four inches and 50 pounds on him, but he\u2019s the one in control. We kiss, grab each at each other. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d I stammer, inhaling sharply to make my question obvious. \u201cZizanie,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd soon, I hope, you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thuy is smooth. I want to drink every inch of him."}, {"ee3a": "Thirty minutes later, we\u2019re back in his immaculate Southside apartment.

Until now, the only time I had spent the night with a man was a john who paid me extra to stay in the motel with him. (It was awful. I had to be the little spoon, and in his sleep the john rhythmically kissed my shoulder over and over again. I had to wrestle him just to get up to pee.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blessedly, Thuy doesn\u2019t want to hold or be held. In the middle of the night, I wake up with that typical \u201cstrange bed, strange partner\u201d panic. I look around and realize we\u2019re both on our backs, and our fingers are interlaced. Nothing else is touching. It is terribly sweet, and it\u2019s easy to fall back asleep.\u00a0\u00a0Two nights later, on our second date, I come out to Thuy as bisexual and an off-again, on-again sex worker. I assume that he\u2019ll be more concerned about the former, but he\u2019s not. Instead, he misses the point."}, {"8f14": "\u201cLots of gay men sleep with women until they accept who they are,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI had sex with a girl once too.\u201d I try to explain that it\u2019s not like that, that I\u2019m probably more romantically and sexually drawn to women than to men, but Thuy is dismissive. I can\u2019t remember if he actually uses the phrase \u201cjust a phase\u201d to describe my bisexuality, but it\u2019s certainly what he means.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t feel confident enough to argue.\u00a0\u00a0And anyhow, the sex is great. The sex gets better. I can\u2019t enough of him, nor it seems, he of me. And indeed, at first, I\u2019m the one pushing to get together more often: I\u2019m a sophomore history major, he\u2019s a junior in one of the nation\u2019s most punishing architecture programs. He has more work than I do. I\u2019m sleeping over only two nights a week. I\u2019d like twice that.\u00a0\u00a0And yet, on the nights I\u2019m not with Thuy, I lie in bed and stroke myself thinking about April. I also have a growing crush on Robin, a girl who lives in my co-op, and I daydream about what it would be like to kiss her. I am already half in love with her. I can\u2019t imagine feeling half as much for Thuy."}, {"1df3": "There\u2019s time, though.

I think of my grandmother, and for a reason I can\u2019t quite articulate, know she would be more upset if she found out I had a boyfriend than if she knew I\u2019d slept with men for money."}, {"adbe": "More to the point, I\u2019m not sure if I want a boyfriend."}, {"2279": "\u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d I say, and bite his neck, my hand reaching between his legs. He is half-erect, and I start to run my fingers along his penis. \u201cI love your cock,\u201d I whisper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thuy lifts my jaw, kisses my forehead, my eyes, my nose, my mouth. \u201cI love\u2026 all this,\u201d he says softly, and I recoil at the mix of fragility and need I hear in his voice. I recoil at the pause after the verb."}, {"2c23": "I need to say something, the boy\u2019s falling in love, and I can\u2019t, I just can\u2019t, I need to stop this now and\u200a\u2014\u200aI say nothing. I use my mouth instead to kiss my way down Thuy\u2019s chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than ever, I try to show off the skills the men taught me. I think perhaps I\u2019m using pleasure to create distance, but maybe that\u2019s 50 year-old me imposing an insight on my 19 year-old self. It\u2019s safe to say I was turned on, confused and guilty. I was changing the subject.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a 19 year-old, I\u2019m pretty fucking good at what I do. When Thuy comes, he holds my head and cries out \u201cHugo, Hugo, Hugo, Hugo.\u201d He keeps repeating my name, more and more softly, until I climb back up his slender body and shut him up with kisses. For years afterward, I will do that same name thing when I ejaculate with women I really like or am in love with. I finally stop when one gal tells me it freaks her the fuck out.\u00a0\u00a0Friday night that week, Thuy takes me to Zachary\u2019s for their legendary pizza. Zachary\u2019s is the sort of place where two college boys can be \u201cout\u201d, even in 1986. We lean into each other, laugh, and when we think it isn\u2019t too obvious, feed each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pizza tends to heighten my optimism. Maybe I can do this boyfriend thing, I decide. Maybe it just takes some getting used to. Maybe I can fall in love with this sweet, sexy guy.\u00a0\u00a0Thuy eats two slices: I gobble the rest. As I munch on the last piece, Thuy pinches my tummy under the table. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I like that belly of yours,\u201d he says \u201csome guys won\u2019t let you get away with that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I put the half-eaten final slice back down, and look away. I feel the tears starting to come. Men have shamed my body for being too pale or too soft or too something since I was 17. I just didn\u2019t expect it, however mildly, from a guy who\u2019s supposed to be falling for me.\u00a0\u00a0Thuy sees my face and is instantly abjectly apologetic, waxing frantically eloquent about how much he likes everything about me. I study his toned arms. Thuy works out five days a week; he has the lean, compact, fat-free body of a gymnast. I am years away from becoming a serious runner myself. Next to him, I feel like a clumsy, oafish bear.\u00a0\u00a0We drive into the Berkeley hills and have sex in his cramped Accord. Our clothes only come half off, but Thuy takes the opportunity to remind me how much he loves my body. His eagerness to atone isn\u2019t sweet. It\u2019s annoying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I lose my erection. We drive back to his apartment in silence. I wish I could sleep at my own place."}, {"c158": "Saturday morning, Thuy brings me tea in bed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not a very exciting kidnapping,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI\u2019m just taking you for a day in the city. But it\u2019ll be fun! So get up and shower so you smell good for me!\u201d"}, {"1029": "When we get into his car, Thuy announces he has a present for me. With a flourish, he produces a Crystal Gayle cassette. He knows I love country music, which he despises. I\u2019m not a particular Gayle fan, but the gesture is adorable. We listen to the \u201cStraight to the Heart\u201d album as we drive over the bridge to San Francisco. Thuy reaches for my hand, and I take it.\u00a0\u00a0It is a bright and fogless day. Thuy drives to Golden Gate Park, and as we enter, he starts to lecture about the architecture of the various buildings. His accent and slight lisp are two of my favorite things about him, and I normally like listening to him, but as we park, I begin to feel my stomach start to hurt again.\u00a0\u00a0It only takes me a second to know why. When we were in high school, April and I came here together on a field trip. We were newly in love, and kept sneaking off to make out behind trees. It was a magical day, one of my favorite memories of my very first serious romance."}, {"997f": "And now, at last I get it. I now know with absolute certainty I can never love Thuy the way he already is starting to love me. I can never love Thuy the way I loved April and the way I am sure I will love other girls."}, {"17b9": "Most vitally, I am at last sure that I can never love any man the way I love women. I love sucking cock; I love the feel of a man\u2019s stubble against my own. But my heart just won\u2019t open to boys, not that way. Bisexuality doesn\u2019t mean equal romantic and sexual attraction to both sexes, after all. I\u2019ve known for years that I like fucking both men and women. I now have confirmation of what I had already suspected: I will never be able to have romantic feelings for guys.\u00a0\u00a0I grasp all this in the moments it takes us to walk from the car to the De Young Museum in the heart of the park. I let Thuy be my guide to what I\u2019ve already seen; I squeeze back when he squeezes my hand. If I can hold out to lunch, I tell myself, I\u2019ll tell him then. Just an hour or two."}, {"5c67": "I can\u2019t make it. After a few minutes, Thuy looks at my ashen, anxious face and asks what\u2019s wrong. I ask if we can go sit down, and worried, he agrees. We go outside and sit on the grass and in a heated rush tell him I can\u2019t love him, can\u2019t love any man, that I can only love women, that men are for friendship and sex and I\u2019m happy to be his friend and I like fucking but we can\u2019t keep acting like this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cover my face out of fear of his anger. Thuy doesn\u2019t get angry. After a moment of contemplation he starts to sob, deep, wrenching, my dog-has-died sobs. Normally fastidious, he wipes his snot on his shirt, sobs more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust shut up,\u201d he says."}, {"19b0": "We sit on the grass for half an hour in silence until Thuy collects himself. We rise."}, {"3e59": "\u201cI can take a tram,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me home.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thuy tells me not to be an asshole. He\u2019ll drive me.\u00a0\u00a0We are halfway across the Bay Bridge before he says anything. \u201cNever do this to anyone else,\u201d he says coldly. \u201cLearn to be honest with yourself.\u201d"}, {"eda0": "I nod. He drops me off at my apartment. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call,\u201d he says, \u201c and if we see each other, let\u2019s just keep walking.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I apologize again as I get out of the car. Thuy says nothing, and pulls away the second the door is shut. Except for that one moment with Ivy, I will never see him again."}, {"8bd6": "I do not know what became of Thuy, whose real name is one of the most common possible Vietnamese combinations. He was bright and talented and gorgeous, and I hope his career and his romantic life both flourished in the years after our very brief affair.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt guilty for years about this boy, the only man whose heart I ever hurt. Some of the guilt would go when I would be in the same position as Thuy, in love with a lesbian curious to see how much her heart would permit her with a man. The rest of the guilt went when I accepted my younger self as innocent and curious rather than cruel and reckless.\u00a0\u00a0The heart is a flexible muscle, and love and passion can come in, time and again, in unexpected and surprising ways. There are limitations, however, to just how flexible most of us can be. The luckiest of us know those limitations without needing to experiment. The rest of us need to learn through trial and error how we\u2019re meant to love. And a few weeks of trial and error taught me I could not love a boy, not even one as gleaming and lovely as Thuy.\u00a0\u00a0More than 30 years later, on the rare occasions I catch Zizanie on someone\u2019s skin, I remember his taste, his lisp, his touch, and his tears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that, that\u2019s not enough for love."}], "content": "I Had One Boyfriend, and I Broke His Heart: Sex, Youth, and the Limits of\u00a0Love May 1987, Berkeley, California.\u00a0\u00a0Ivy and I walk across campus.

More to the point, I\u2019m not sure if I want a boyfriend. \u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d I say, and bite his neck, my hand reaching between his legs. He is half-erect, and I start to run my fingers along his penis. \u201cI love your cock,\u201d I whisper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thuy lifts my jaw, kisses my forehead, my eyes, my nose, my mouth. \u201cI love\u2026 all this,\u201d he says softly, and I recoil at the mix of fragility and need I hear in his voice. I recoil at the pause after the verb. I need to say something, the boy\u2019s falling in love, and I can\u2019t, I just can\u2019t, I need to stop this now and\u200a\u2014\u200aI say nothing. I use my mouth instead to kiss my way down Thuy\u2019s chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than ever, I try to show off the skills the men taught me. I think perhaps I\u2019m using pleasure to create distance, but maybe that\u2019s 50 year-old me imposing an insight on my 19 year-old self. It\u2019s safe to say I was turned on, confused and guilty. I was changing the subject.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a 19 year-old, I\u2019m pretty fucking good at what I do. When Thuy comes, he holds my head and cries out \u201cHugo, Hugo, Hugo, Hugo.\u201d He keeps repeating my name, more and more softly, until I climb back up his slender body and shut him up with kisses. For years afterward, I will do that same name thing when I ejaculate with women I really like or am in love with. I finally stop when one gal tells me it freaks her the fuck out.\u00a0\u00a0Friday night that week, Thuy takes me to Zachary\u2019s for their legendary pizza. Zachary\u2019s is the sort of place where two college boys can be \u201cout\u201d, even in 1986. We lean into each other, laugh, and when we think it isn\u2019t too obvious, feed each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pizza tends to heighten my optimism. Maybe I can do this boyfriend thing, I decide. Maybe it just takes some getting used to. Maybe I can fall in love with this sweet, sexy guy.\u00a0\u00a0Thuy eats two slices: I gobble the rest. As I munch on the last piece, Thuy pinches my tummy under the table. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I like that belly of yours,\u201d he says \u201csome guys won\u2019t let you get away with that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I put the half-eaten final slice back down, and look away. I feel the tears starting to come. Men have shamed my body for being too pale or too soft or too something since I was 17. I just didn\u2019t expect it, however mildly, from a guy who\u2019s supposed to be falling for me.\u00a0\u00a0Thuy sees my face and is instantly abjectly apologetic, waxing frantically eloquent about how much he likes everything about me. I study his toned arms. Thuy works out five days a week; he has the lean, compact, fat-free body of a gymnast. I am years away from becoming a serious runner myself. Next to him, I feel like a clumsy, oafish bear.\u00a0\u00a0We drive into the Berkeley hills and have sex in his cramped Accord. Our clothes only come half off, but Thuy takes the opportunity to remind me how much he loves my body. His eagerness to atone isn\u2019t sweet. It\u2019s annoying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I lose my erection. We drive back to his apartment in silence. I wish I could sleep at my own place. Saturday morning, Thuy brings me tea in bed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not a very exciting kidnapping,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI\u2019m just taking you for a day in the city. But it\u2019ll be fun! So get up and shower so you smell good for me!\u201d When we get into his car, Thuy announces he has a present for me. With a flourish, he produces a Crystal Gayle cassette. He knows I love country music, which he despises. I\u2019m not a particular Gayle fan, but the gesture is adorable. We listen to the \u201cStraight to the Heart\u201d album as we drive over the bridge to San Francisco. Thuy reaches for my hand, and I take it.\u00a0\u00a0It is a bright and fogless day. Thuy drives to Golden Gate Park, and as we enter, he starts to lecture about the architecture of the various buildings. His accent and slight lisp are two of my favorite things about him, and I normally like listening to him, but as we park, I begin to feel my stomach start to hurt again.\u00a0\u00a0It only takes me a second to know why. When we were in high school, April and I came here together on a field trip. We were newly in love, and kept sneaking off to make out behind trees. It was a magical day, one of my favorite memories of my very first serious romance. And now, at last I get it. I now know with absolute certainty I can never love Thuy the way he already is starting to love me. I can never love Thuy the way I loved April and the way I am sure I will love other girls. Most vitally, I am at last sure that I can never love any man the way I love women. I love sucking cock; I love the feel of a man\u2019s stubble against my own. But my heart just won\u2019t open to boys, not that way. Bisexuality doesn\u2019t mean equal romantic and sexual attraction to both sexes, after all. I\u2019ve known for years that I like fucking both men and women. I now have confirmation of what I had already suspected: I will never be able to have romantic feelings for guys.\u00a0\u00a0I grasp all this in the moments it takes us to walk from the car to the De Young Museum in the heart of the park. I let Thuy be my guide to what I\u2019ve already seen; I squeeze back when he squeezes my hand. If I can hold out to lunch, I tell myself, I\u2019ll tell him then. Just an hour or two. I can\u2019t make it. After a few minutes, Thuy looks at my ashen, anxious face and asks what\u2019s wrong. I ask if we can go sit down, and worried, he agrees. We go outside and sit on the grass and in a heated rush tell him I can\u2019t love him, can\u2019t love any man, that I can only love women, that men are for friendship and sex and I\u2019m happy to be his friend and I like fucking but we can\u2019t keep acting like this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cover my face out of fear of his anger. Thuy doesn\u2019t get angry. After a moment of contemplation he starts to sob, deep, wrenching, my dog-has-died sobs. Normally fastidious, he wipes his snot on his shirt, sobs more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust shut up,\u201d he says. We sit on the grass for half an hour in silence until Thuy collects himself. We rise. \u201cI can take a tram,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me home.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thuy tells me not to be an asshole. He\u2019ll drive me.\u00a0\u00a0We are halfway across the Bay Bridge before he says anything. \u201cNever do this to anyone else,\u201d he says coldly. \u201cLearn to be honest with yourself.\u201d I nod. He drops me off at my apartment. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call,\u201d he says, \u201c and if we see each other, let\u2019s just keep walking.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I apologize again as I get out of the car. Thuy says nothing, and pulls away the second the door is shut. Except for that one moment with Ivy, I will never see him again. I do not know what became of Thuy, whose real name is one of the most common possible Vietnamese combinations. He was bright and talented and gorgeous, and I hope his career and his romantic life both flourished in the years after our very brief affair.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt guilty for years about this boy, the only man whose heart I ever hurt. Some of the guilt would go when I would be in the same position as Thuy, in love with a lesbian curious to see how much her heart would permit her with a man. The rest of the guilt went when I accepted my younger self as innocent and curious rather than cruel and reckless.\u00a0\u00a0The heart is a flexible muscle, and love and passion can come in, time and again, in unexpected and surprising ways. There are limitations, however, to just how flexible most of us can be. The luckiest of us know those limitations without needing to experiment. The rest of us need to learn through trial and error how we\u2019re meant to love. And a few weeks of trial and error taught me I could not love a boy, not even one as gleaming and lovely as Thuy.\u00a0\u00a0More than 30 years later, on the rare occasions I catch Zizanie on someone\u2019s skin, I remember his taste, his lisp, his touch, and his tears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that, that\u2019s not enough for love.
