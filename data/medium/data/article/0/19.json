[1]: In this instance, we made the problematic assumption that zipcode = neighborhood. Our next blog post directly challenges this assumption\u00a0:) The Biggest\u00a0Split The most fundamental division produced by our clustering algorithm groups together most of Manhattan\u200a\u2014\u200aexcluding Harlem\u200a\u2014\u200awith the areas of Brooklyn closest to downtown Manhattan. The biggest split: Manhattan (without Harlem) and the areas of Brooklyn closest to downtown Manhattan. Despite the fact that we didn\u2019t include any explicit economic indicators in our input data, comparing these two clusters reveals some radical economic differences: The average house value of cluster 1 ($818,318) is almost twice that of cluster 2 ($488,513) and the median household income for cluster 1 ($91,679) is also roughly twice that of cluster 2 ($57,192). In contrast, the average age of cluster 1 (36.8) is nearly identical to that of cluster 2 (36.1) The Closest Connection Based on our overall similarity metric, the two most closely related neighborhoods in NYC are Howard Beach, Queens and Seaside[2], Staten Island. These two neighborhoods are about as far apart as two New York City neighborhoods can be geographically\u200a\u2014\u200ait takes 7 hours to walk the 25 miles that separates them\u200a\u2014\u200ayet they have much in common, from their waterfront parks to the range of cuisines available (To Do: Linguine and Clam showdown between Vetro on the Bay in Howard Beach and Giovanni\u2019s in Seaside?). Again there is an interesting relationship between the economies of these waterfront neighborhoods, despite any explicit economic input data: the average house value in the two neighborhoods are remarkably similar ($534,700 for Howard Beach vs $491,800 for Seaside) [2]: Seaside is the largest neighborhood grouping within the 10312 zipcode, and we use it to refer to the 10312. However, the fact that Seaside is contained in 10312 but not equal to 10312 demonstrates one of the challenges inherent in looking at zipcodes. Tune in next month for more on this contentious topic. Riverside South (Trump Place) Stands\u00a0Apart Riverside South, which spans along Manhattan\u2019s westside from 59th to 72nd streets, is separated both culturally and formally from it\u2019s surroundings. This largely residential area\u200a\u2014\u200acomplex might be a more appropriate word\u200a\u2014\u200ahas spurred controversy ever since Donald Trump proposed converting what was once a rail yard into a series of high-rise luxury apartment buildings in the 70s (most recently, tenants demanded that \u2018Trump\u2019 be dropped from all building signage). As mentioned above, we constructed clusterings using, on the one hand, only formal analysis of the built environment, and on the other hand, only metrics related to the culture of the neighborhood; in both cases, Riverside South was an isolated island within the sea of surrounding westside neighborhoods, all of which were grouped into a different cluster. Whether it\u2019s the complete lack of nightlife or the spatial experience of walking through a canyon of nearly identical residential towers, Riverside South is radically different from the vibrant westside neighborhoods it is surrounded by. Williamsburg, Manhattan Culturally, Williamsburg has more in common with lower Manhattan than it does with the rest of Brooklyn. Even when looking at nearby (and oft-compared) Greenpoint and Bushwick, the cultural experience (whether that means running into a yoga studio or a Michelin-starred restaurant) of Williamsburg resonates more strongly with the chunk of Manhattan just across the East River. Soho is\u00a0Special In addition to the unique cast iron architecture we all know and love (The SoHo Cast Iron Historic District was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978), Soho is set apart culturally from the rest of Lower Manhattan, and NYC more broadly. Shopping, eating, going out, being vegan, looking at art\u2026it\u2019s a different story in Soho; Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising then, that living next to Prada, Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga also comes with a different price tag: Apartments in Soho are 30% higher than apartments in surrounding Lower Manhattan. Dense, Gridded Manhattan Examining the dendrogram of clusters produced from a purely formal analysis of the built environment of NYC reveals a large, persistent cluster of gridded, dense Manhattan neighborhoods. Comprising Midtown, the Upper East Side (up to Yorkville), Chelsea, Murray Hill, Greenwich Village, the East Village and Soho, this cluster is defined by highly regular, uniformly gridded space. Equally interesting are the neighborhoods that are excluded from this grouping like the West Village, with its labyrinthine streets at skew angles to the rest of the city, or Hell\u2019s Kitchen, which falls to pieces at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Manhattan is a Very Diverse\u00a0Island Examining the dendrogram starting from the bottom\u200a\u2014\u200awhere all neighborhoods are in their own cluster\u200a\u2014\u200awe find that neighborhoods in Manhattan remain isolated for much longer than neighborhoods in other boroughs. This implies that while other neighborhoods (Like Howard Beach and Seaside mentioned above) join groupings, neighborhoods in Manhattan are more distinct, remaining separated both from one another and from the rest of New York City. While the majority of neighborhoods in other boroughs are joining clusters, neighborhoods in Manhattan remain distinct. More specifically, it takes 40 levels of clusters forming for any neighborhood in Manhattan to be connected to another neighborhood; in this case, Southern Harlem joins Manhattanville. Meanwhile throughout the rest of NYC, 73 neighborhoods have been grouped together, covering a majority percentage of zipcodes in the Bronx (52%), Brooklyn (51%), Queens (54%) and Staten Island (67%). It takes another 17 levels of clustering for the next Manhattan neighborhood to be connected, when Hamilton Heights joins Prospect Lefferts Gardens.
