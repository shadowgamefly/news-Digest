Like water, they all spill out onto our feet and wash across the pavement, and that person, the one who saves us every time, listens. They advise and comfort, sometimes they take action against our demons. As waves crash down around us, they toss a raft and in rough waters they throw down an anchor. In return they ask for nothing, they request no saving. While we may waiver, they never do. Strong and steady, wise beyond words, where would we be without them? Who would we be without them? Yet we often forget that sometimes the person who saves us will also need to be saved.\u00a0Preoccupied with our own trials, do we ever stop to consider theirs? How often do we repeat back to them the words they so faithfully and selflessly ask us? \u201cHow about you?
