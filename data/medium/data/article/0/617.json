Hackson Brown, JR.medium.com He\u2019s a regular Medium contributor and he also runs a website called Zero to Skill. In this post, he was analyzing another post of his that went viral, \u201c13 things you should give up if you want to be successful.\u201d Turns out he wrote the most recommended story in the history of\u00a0Medium 13 Things You Should Give Up If You Want To Be Successful\u201dSomebody once told me the definition of hell:medium.com The image at the top of this page? That\u2019s a screenshot of his stats for this one post. At the time of writing his analysis, it had over 5 million views and recommended by over 34,000 people. Medium doesn\u2019t show social shares, but I\u2019m sure those are well into the 10s of thousands too. The reason why I\u2019m focusing on his follow-up analysis of the post is because it\u2019s a treasure-trove of lessons for marketers. Writes Cvijetic, It took me four days to write the following piece\u2026 But it took me over nine months to make it go viral and to become the most recommended story in the history of\u00a0Medium. In my post, the one you\u2019re reading right now, Tl;dr: what you will learn in this\u00a0post 1) You Can\u2019t Predict\u00a0Virality What you *can* do, is look at other content that went viral and find common elements between them. Then, incorporate those elements into your own material. Cvijetic cites Jonah Berger\u2019s STEPPS framework of virality. If you\u2019ve read Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath mention 6 principles of Sticky Ideas which are verily similar to Bergers (more on this later.) This is something I\u2019ve talked about in one of my own blog posts. You can\u2019t \u201cchase\u201d virality. You have to Jeet Kune Do it\u200a\u2014\u200aabsorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is uniquely your own. 2) You Went Viral. Now\u00a0What? This is probably the best part of his article. Cvijetic had the self-awareness to say, I\u2019m spending all this time to create this content, hoping it will resonate with my audience. What if one of them becomes really\u00a0popular? Is my platform ready to deal with the extra attention? Imagine\u2026You spend 20 hours creating a masterpiece. It goes viral. You get a massive spike in web traffic. Your website goes down. Or your email marketing provider can\u2019t handle the spike in signups. Or you forgot to tell them what to do after reading your piece. Or you don\u2019t have a landing page set up properly. All it took to avoid a massive wasted opportunity is two phone calls to his web host and email provider to make sure his website and email marketing service could handle the additional load. He also made sure to budget for the increased hosting and email marketing fees. Also, having a single, clear call to action which links to an optimized landing page is table stakes. If you haven\u2019t taken the time to do this prep work, you have no business trying to create viral content. 3) The Follow-Up is 100X More Valuable than the Viral\u00a0Post This is deliberately subjective on my part. The post that went viral, while very good, was high-level and a little abstract. The follow-up post, *showing* us it was by design, and not a flash in the pan, was just better. There are two lessons here. First, speak to people at their level, in the way they understand. As you educate them, as they improve, you can slowly introduce them to the more complex stuff. Cvijetic mentions how just tweaking one word in his title made all the difference in the World. He didn\u2019t pull the tweak out of his ass either. His research led him to make the change (more on this later.) Second, your viral content won\u2019t necessarily be your best\u00a0content. Cvijetic mentions he normally writes 3000+ word, long-form posts. However, because he was deliberately designing a \u201cviral post,\u201d he looked up what kind of content goes viral on Medium and adapted his content creation to suit the channel. Combined, they highlight a valuable lesson Ramit Sethi teaches his students. Give people what they want right now so you can give them what they need\u00a0later. 4) Don\u2019t put Artificial Limitations on Your\u00a0Success With the exception of the post I\u2019m discussing right now, every one of Cvijetic\u2019s Medium posts was originally published on his website. AND he ended up republishing it on several mainstream media outlets. Now, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I have this narrative in my head about my website. I tell myself, You should only grow your website 100%\u00a0organic. Everything needs to be original\u00a0content. Don\u2019t pay for\u00a0traffic. Don\u2019t make The Man rich off of syndicating your\u00a0content. Don\u2019t re-publish old content for your guest posts, that\u2019s just lazy\u2026Write fresh material. Yadda yadda yadda. I mean, I\u2019ll be honest, it makes great sense in my head, and still sort of makes sense even after writing it down. However, after reading about Cvijetic\u2019s success, maybe there\u2019s more to it than I thought. After you identify your primary objective, do whatever steps are necessary to reach that goal. Don\u2019t let secondary objectives divert your focus or make you take actions that will self-sabotage achieving your primary objective. Here\u2019s a fun caveat to think about. This just came to my mind while writing this post. Do any of you read X-Men? PEW, PEW,\u00a0PEW So, there was this clone of Magneto called Joseph. Joseph was way more powerful than Magneto in terms of raw power, but he ended up dying. His power consumed him. Because he was cloned as an adult and had complete access to his powers from day 1, he didn\u2019t have the same control as Magneto, who had to learn how to use his powers over decades. Magneto deliberately limits his power output because he knows what can happen if he really lets loose. You\u2019ll have to Jeet Kune Do this analogy in whichever way applies to you. Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is uniquely your\u00a0own 5) Virality is the Product of Consistency This is something I\u2019ve blogged and podcasted about before. Cvijetic has 19 posts on Medium. A few do pretty well, sitting at around 1k hearts. Most are in the dozens or 100s. ONE post went viral. AND his results are far better than most. Look at people like #SaltBae and the Chicken Connoisseur. SaltBae\u2019s first Instagram post was almost 4 years ago. It has 2k likes. Dude\u2019s been consistent ever since. He only went viral a few weeks ago. Now, his posts get 10s of thousands of likes. Some are over 100k. His latest Instagram videos have millions of views. Episode 1 of the Pengest Munch was a year ago. Elijah Quashie (the Chicken Connoisseur) and his team dropped 4 episodes and were inactive for 9 months until releasing episode 5. Episode 5 of the Pengest Munch was when the show got traction and went viral. I remember checking out his channel back then when episodes 1\u20134 had only a few thousand views (hadn\u2019t even broken 5 figures.) Now, it could be that Elijah and his team got busy and didn\u2019t have time to produce more content. However, I will take an educated guess and say they produced 4 episodes, got low engagement, got demotivated and quit. Then 3 months ago decided to give it another shot. Virality, disruption, stickiness, is the product of 100s, if not 1000s of iterations. There\u2019s no substitute for putting in the work. 6) Sell Benefits, not Features/Functions I mentioned earlier that Cvijetic tweaked one word in the title. He changed the word \u201cproductive\u201d (how it was originally titled on his website) to \u201csuccessful.\u201d Now, he explains the change as being practical\u200a\u2014\u200athere are over 500% more search engine results for the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d it was the new year so people are in re-invention mode, etc. However, without even thinking about it (or maybe he did, just didn\u2019t mention it) he sold the BENEFITS of productivity as opposed to the FUNCTION of being productive. This is copywriting rule numero uno. How many post titles do we see with the word \u201cproductive\u201d in them? Over the course of a year, maybe thousands. A) We\u2019re completely desensitized to the word. B) We immediately think, \u201cI\u2019ve probably read this material before.\u201d Change the word \u201cproductive\u201d to \u201csuccess,\u201d however, and it\u2019s a guaranteed click. A lot of people may believe they are productive, with their Pomodoros and their calendars and their morning meditations. But everyone DESIRES to be more successful. 7) BONUS: I Apply \u201cMade to Stick\u201d to Cvijetic\u2019s Post Cvijetic says he built his viral post on Berger\u2019s STEPPS framework. He also, knowingly or not, has applied the Sticky Ideas framework. In their best-selling book, \u201cMade to Stick,\u201d Chip and Dan Heath distil sticky ideas down to 6 principles: Here\u2019s how Cvijetic compares. Simplicity It\u2019s a listicle and it\u2019s short. Unexpectedness He wrote a skim-your-feed-stopping, scroll-stopping, disruptive headline. Concreteness Every point is a specific action you can do, or stop doing. Credibility Every point is accompanied with a motivational quote from a popular contemporary or historical figure. Emotions Every point is something we really don\u2019t like about ourselves. Stories He opens the post with \u201csomeone once told me\u2026.\u201d Conclusion You can\u2019t create viral content. What you can do, is bust your ass to consistently create amazing content the masses will love to read and share, i.e. content that has the possibility of going viral. You can also make sure that if and when your content does go viral, you are in a position to capitalize on the massive spike in attention. Because virality is just a tool, it\u2019s not the goal. The goal is to make more $$$. My challenge to\u00a0you Think of ONE way you can immediately implement something you\u2019ve learned from this post and tell me what it is in the comments below. Be specific\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat will you do? How long will it take to execute? How long until you see results? Can you predict its ROI (ball-park)?\u200a\u2014\u200apaint me a picture.
