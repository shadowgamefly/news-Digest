CREDIT: Getty\u00a0Images Have you taken a look at the market for promotional swag products as of late? The sector is in the midst of a massive shift that is bringing new opportunities for brands to interact with customers, to build a strong bond that will help them stand out in the market. This week I spoke with Aiia, an international promotional products creator in the U.S., Poland and the U.K. to get insights on the promotional product trends that will lead the marketing agenda in 2017. 1. Design and quality are\u00a0key. Top companies invest heavily in powerful customer experiences to keep product fans coming back. Promotional products play a significant role in this mix. But the modern customer is increasingly hard to impress. Low-quality or ill-conceived gifts will not thrive. Instead, unique design and high quality are coming into their own. How to harness this trend? Invest in high-end and unique ideas such as an endless puzzle or a unique high-end digital frame to hold the attention of customers, which will naturally lead to increased mind and market share for your brand. 2. Mobile apps will change the way people and companies use promo\u00a0gifts. High-quality promotional gifts will be increasingly bundled with companion smartphone apps. The crux of this trend is the opportunity for brands to use engaging and useful content to interact with customers long after the point of product giveaway. Select promo products with mobile app extensions and you will gain hundreds of opportunities to interact with target customers. As an example, consider a smart Bluetooth finder to keep track of items such as your keys. 3. Smart promo products are taking off in a big\u00a0way. The number of people who use smart devices\u200a\u2014\u200afitness trackers, smart speakers, connected gadgets for the home, work and pets\u200a\u2014\u200ahas grown dramatically. The majority of customers will soon (or may already) prefer smart gadgets as gifts.
