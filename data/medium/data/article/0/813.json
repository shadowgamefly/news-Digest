But few people know that Gladwell\u2019s books are deeply inspired by another, lesser-known book: \u201cAll of my books have been, in some sense, intellectual godchildren of The Person and the Situation. This book has been a constant companion over the past 10 years.\u201d What\u2019s so amazing about it? Gladwell again: \u201cThe genius of this book is that it will insinuate itself into the way you think about virtually everything.\u201d More on what this book has to teach us a bit later. First, a story\u2026 Growing Up \u201cWe\u2019re adults now, man. I\u2019ve learned to be realistic\u201d That\u2019s Jarred. We\u2019re at a sushi restaurant in South Florida, catching up for the first time in a few years. In high school, Jarred made you believe he could do anything. He\u2019d ace all his classes without studying and spend all his time playing around with whatever interested him. One time, he made a Super Mario game that you could play on your calculator and it spread all over the school\u200a\u2014\u200aboy was that a nightmare for the math teaching staff. We all knew he was going to be big. Jarred\u2019s looking down at his plate now, spreading out a blob of wasabi with his fork. \u201cIt\u2019s a big world out there. Billions of people. What\u2019s the point of doing anything? I\u2019m just one guy, man.\u201d The Mississippi Effect Call me an optimist, but I can\u2019t agree with Jarred. Let\u2019s go back Ross and Nisbett\u2019s The Person and the Situation. In it, they introduce a concept that I call the \u201cMississippi Effect.\u201d It involves, as you might expect, Mississippi River: \u2026the river meanders through its last several hundred miles before spilling into the Gulf of Mexico in a general course that could not be altered by any event of less than cataclysmic proportions. What can one human do against something that powerful, that majestic? Follow me along for a thought experiment. Let\u2019s say I bring you the bank of the Mississippi River. I hand you a shovel. \u201cYour job,\u201d I say, \u201cis to change the flow of this river. You are only allowed to use this shovel.\u201d Could you do it? Here\u2019s another anecdote about the Mississippi: A person with a shovel can, at the right place, start a small cut that gets bigger and bigger until the whole river flows through the new channel and an entire curve of the river is obliterated. This, my friends, is the \u201cMississippi Effect.\u201d Small actions, applied in the right place, can have cataclysmic effects. Levers and\u00a0Rivers Now, let\u2019s turn the clock back 2200 years. Here\u2019s a quote from Archimedes of Syracuse, the great mathematician, engineer and scientist: \u201cGive me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the\u00a0world.\u201d Archimedes\u2019 Lever (WIkimedia Commons) What can one human do? Well, if that human has a really long stick and knows where to put it, he can do a lot. There\u2019s a fundamental truth these analogies are getting at. In life, there are asymmetries. Some powerful actions\u200a\u2014\u200alike a thousand shovels thrown into the river\u200a\u2014\u200ahave little to no effect. But others, with a single stroke, can literally change the flow of history. Lion and\u00a0Sheep One last asymmetry, perhaps the most powerful. Here is bestselling author Nassim Taleb on what he calls the minority rule: The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly. I\u2019ll let you judge his argument for yourself, but his main point is not so different from that of the Mississippi Effect\u200a\u2014\u200acorrect application by a small force can have a tremendous global impact. All it takes, says Taleb, is a few, special people: Society doesn\u2019t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meeting, academic conferences, and polling; only a few people suffice to disproportionately move the needle. We love to talk about equality these days, but let us not confuse equality of opportunity with equality of outcome. Where you start does not dictate where you shall end.
