Two quotes are instructive: No one is exempt from this reality. We are all living with some amount of internal conflict. Shrinking the gap between who we are and who we want to be is completely do-able. Here\u2019s the process: The Two Motivational Systems Operating in Your\u00a0Life Put simply, there are two primary systems determining and influencing every decision and action (or inaction) in your life. Your behavioral inhibition system is what attunes you to risks or threats in your environment. When you perceive these risks or threats, your behavioral inhibition system stops you from acting. Your behavioral activation system, on the other hand, is what attunes you to rewards. When you perceive these rewards, your behavioral activation system encourages you to action so you can obtain the reward. These two systems are in constant tension with one another. In every situation, one of these systems is over-ruling the other. Either you are acting, or you\u2019re inhibiting action. Every person has different tendencies respective to these two systems. Some people are far more inhibition-oriented, with a high sensitivity to risks and threats. Others are more activation or approach-oriented, with a high sensitivity to rewards.

Getting Yourself to\u00a0Act People who are prone to perfectionism are likely to have a high risk sensitivity. I have a friend like this.
