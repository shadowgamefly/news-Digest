So now you may be wondering about how open source contributions can help you in learning good practices of a language. There are various aspects of it. Let\u2019s discuss them one by one. Code Quality Most of the good open source projects have strict coding guidelines which you have to adhere to in order to get your code merged. This will help you in adapting those guidelines and hence writing good quality code even though you are just learning the language. Not just that, you have a chance to look at the rest of the code and see how well it\u2019s written and/or documented. Code Reviews The best part about open source contributions is code reviewing. When you push your code, you get feedback from the experts associated with that project and hence it gives you a chance to improve your understanding of a language. This is like getting a free-of-cost personal guidance about how to write good code. Appreciation First comment on my first PR in Go Lang (https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/497) We, as software developers, really need appreciation for our work; and open source community makes sure you have enough of that. In my whole experience with open source contributions, I have never received even a single comment which was insulting or demotivating. Everyone is super encouraging and helpful. Another comment by someone in DuckDuckGo community So next time you want to learn a new language, go ahead and take the plunge! Find an open source project to contribute to and march ahead on the path to learning that language and its nuances\u00a0;) Do let me know how this unconventional way works for you.
