There was a day when I looked up and realized that I had become someone who professionally replied to emails, and who wrote as a hobby. You have to learn to say no, because now the bottles you threw in the ocean are all coming back. Make your\u00a0art You have the ability to make art. It gets you through good times and it gets you through the other ones. When things get tough, do what only you do best. Make your art.
