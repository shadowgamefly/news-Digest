First, get clear on your\u00a0why. For me, there\u2019s only one reason to keep a journal: To manage myself. That\u2019s the only practical reason I can think off. Why else would you keep a journal? It\u2019s not that my life is so interesting that I can ever sell it as a memoir. I\u2019m no John Krakauer or Maya Angelou. No, I see journaling as a self-improvement tool. Nothing else.

You can answer all these questions by reading your journal. Don\u2019t know what to write? Here are 3 ideas. 1. Write about your activities. Just write what you\u2019ve been doing. You can either do it in the morning or evening. It doesn\u2019t matter when you do, just try to write about what you\u2019ve done during the past 24 hours.

There\u2019s no better way to address your worries than writing about them. If you worry about something, it seems way worse in your head.

Write about your decisions. Use your journal as a feedback mechanism by second-guessing your own decisions. Making decisions is hard. For example: Those are examples of big decisions. But you can also use it for all the small decisions in life. Deep down, we kind of know the answers. We just don\u2019t look deep enough. Ask yourself a question and try to answer it by reasoning from multiple sides. What are the pros? What are the cons? What are the outcomes? The questions you can ask yourself are endless. There you have it. You see? It\u2019s not complicated stuff. Journaling is a very versatile tool. It helps you with your self-awareness, and it also helps you to improve yourself. If you\u2019re serious about those things, a journal is a must. Now, all you have to do is open a new page in your physical journal, or a document in your digital journal, and start writing: \u201cToday is the first day of my daily journaling habit.\u201d There\u2019s this weird thing\u2014when you write things down, they become real.
