But a quick word: if you\u2019re just beginning, you\u2019ll really need two days to get the system fully running. 1. Collect\u00a0Ideas Today, as you go on with the rest of your day, grab any ideas that come to you and capture them in a notebook or on an app that you can easily return to later. Shoot for five ideas. Write down a sentence or a phrase. Just enough to save the idea. 2. Write and\u00a0Save Tomorrow, when it\u2019s time to write (say, in the morning, or whenever works for you), pull one of those ideas out of that first bucket. I find that certain ideas speak to me, call to me even, and I try to listen to that voice. But sometimes, I just pick one. Typically, I choose the one that either most excites me or represents a deadline I have to meet. When you\u2019re done, put this piece in the \u201cdrafts\u201d folder and save it for later. Then today, you\u2019re done. 3. Edit and\u00a0Publish The day after, return to yesterday\u2019s draft and edit it. Then move it to bucket three, maybe even publish it on your blog or wherever. Then go to bucket one to pull out a new idea and start writing again. Do this every day, and you\u2019ll never run out of writing topics. You\u2019ll never run out of things to edit and publish. You\u2019ll never have writer\u2019s block again. As long as you remember: writing is not one thing. It\u2019s three things. So that\u2019s my system. Give it a try, and let me know how it works.
