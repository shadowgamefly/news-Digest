Currency is fascinating. People are willing to offer their time, trade their resources and reciprocate kindness or gratitude in exchange for it (think happy customer service). There are so many different dimensions to currency and a curious question that pops up time and time again, revolves around the names. Why is currency labelled and named in so many different ways? Of course, there\u2019s economic and sociocultural reasons why currency has (and still can) range from pounds to pesos or dollars to rupees, but there\u2019s more to it than that. Did you know that \u2018peso\u2019 literally translates to \u2018weight\u2019 in Spanish? In context, weight only ever implies two things: Now, perhaps peso was a physically heavy currency when it was first created (it was metal after all) but it\u2019s much more fascinating to assume that peso was named after the gravitas that it, as a currency holds. From Real Life to Make\u00a0Believe For the purpose of this article, this is the definition we\u2019ll use for In-App currency (IAC)\u2026 In-App currency (IAC) is the fabricated currency tied to a specific app that allows users to purchase assets (items, perks and rewards). IAC comes in 2 forms: In this article, we\u2019re going to focus on Premium IAC. The name of your Simple currency has a much smaller impact on your business\u2019 bottom line. Why? Because with Premium IAC the goal is to get your users to part with their real currency. There\u2019s different mechanics that can be used to increase purchase behaviour, but would user\u2019s rather buy \u2018points\u2019 to upgrade their towers or buy \u2018gems\u2019? \u2026Or would they rather purchase coins, cash, diamonds, doubloons, FarmCash, gems, gold, karma, RiotPoints or tokens (to name a few)? By simply changing the names of Premium IAC in products we\u2019ve designed, we\u2019ve seen increases of over 50% revenue from currency purchases alone. If we extrapolate this data, suddenly $10,000 becomes $15,000, all from a simple name change. In light of this, we created a quick and simple tool dubbed the Currency pyramid to help us brainstorm and rank names for Premium IAC. The Currency\u00a0Pyramid There are 3 areas of focus in the currency pyramid: Using gems as an example, we\u2019ll take a look through each of these areas and work through a few points of consideration for each. Why gems? Gems are an all-round play it safe kinda name. They fall short in a few cases, but more often they\u2019re contextual \u2018enough\u2019 in almost any given scenario. Perceived Value Whether the currency is real or fabricated, it\u2019ll still follow the governing laws of perceived value. Perceived value focuses on how much the user feels the currency is worth. Ultimately, the worth of a currency boils down to its buying power, how difficult it is to earn and (paradoxically) social proof. If more people value and desire the currency, then it becomes infamous and inadvertently, as more people want it, the perceived value increases. Perceived value is the same phenomenon that creates purchase behaviour. If we perceive something as useful and valuable to our lives, then we\u2019re willing to exchange resources to own/get access to it. The important thing to remember is that perceived value is subjective, so don\u2019t expect everyone to \u2018feel\u2019 the same way. To maximise perceived value, focus on creating value for a specific audience (your app\u2019s audience) rather than trying to please everyone, as that\u2019ll dilute the value proposition. This is how we see the perceived value of gems (higher is better): Overall perceived value = moderate (7/10)This might seem harsh, but there\u2019s definitely more valuable currency out there. Through the exploration, we\u2019ve already discovered that gems could be precious or semi-precious and more clarity on the type of gem (or a more suited context) would raise the perceived value here. Perceived Loss Perceived value and perceived loss are two sides of the same coin and often referred to as opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is a simple concept, if you make one decision, what\u2019re you giving up to fulfil that decision? When you buy a new computer, the opportunity cost could be giving up on buying a new washing machine or going on holiday. When you\u2019re buying Premium IAC, you\u2019re buying into a currency that can only be spent within an app, and on the assets within that app. Most users can return a computer, or sell it on to recover some of the loss. With Premium IAC, it can\u2019t be resold, it\u2019s tied to you and you alone. For the purchase of IAC to happen, there needs to be perceived value, but on the other side of the coin, what is the perceived loss? If the perceived loss is too great, but you\u2019ve managed to insight purchase behaviour, then users will feel a phenomenon known as buyer\u2019s regret. With buyer\u2019s regret, users find themselves slowly loathing the purchase they\u2019ve made, deeming it as a poor choice. Buyer\u2019s regret temporarily reduces spending behaviour and leaves a lasting impression on the product that insight it (which is detrimental to a user\u2019s lifetime value). This is how we\u2019d look at the perceived loss for gems (lower is better). Overall perceived loss = moderate (7/10)The loss isn\u2019t too dear, but it\u2019s not unnoticeable, losing gems (precious or otherwise) will be a typically unpleasant ordeal. That being said, balancing the loss through a careful value proposition shouldn\u2019t be too challenging. Perceived Novelty Novelty refers to how fun, memorable and easy to recall the currency is. As users, we all seek fascination and excitement within our lives. When something is fascinating, our involvement with the object in question becomes greater. Even if this fascination is only short-lived, it leaves a lasting and memorable impression in our minds. But fascination is only a small part of what novelty is and how it\u2019s created. If you\u2019re looking for a strict definition of novelty\u2026 Novelty is the quality of being new, original, or unusual.\u200a\u2014\u200aCambridge Dictionary Anything that can insight originality or the unusual can be defined as novel, which gives you a lot of flexibility on what you can do or what you can your Premium IAC. This is how we\u2019d look at perceived novelty for gems (higher is better). Overall perceived novelty = moderate (7/10)Gems have a high recall value and are familiar enough to users that with a clever design to symbolism gems, it\u2019ll be novel enough as a Premium IAC. There\u2019s more novelty out there, but gems are a stable place to start. The Perfect\u00a0Formula In an ideal world, the name of your Premium IAC will look like the above. There\u2019ll be little to no perceived loss, it\u2019ll have incredible perceived value and more than that, it\u2019ll be novel for users to buy and spend. Truth is, there\u2019s no name that can do the above on its own. The experience, context and flow of the app will play a critical part in adding to and creating the perfect formula. In fact, the experience itself has the potential to take any mundane name (like points) and push it towards the perfect balance. That being said, time is alway against us as designers. We could spend 4 weeks crafting an experience to see if we\u2019ve managed to tip the needle, or we can use the Currency Pyramid to increase overall revenue in as little as a day. We use the pyramid to validate our thinking and come up with the best Premium IAC names we can think of and to optimise existing currencies in products. After that, it\u2019s always time to focus on the experience.
