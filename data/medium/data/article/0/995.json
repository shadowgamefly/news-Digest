Highrise Feature\u00a0Requests As I mentioned before, Highrise\u2019s Custom Fields are pretty simple.

I\u2019d like to see Custom Fields support People and Organizations. This means the \u201cReferred By\u201d field, for example, becomes a link to the Person or Organization. As well, multiple entries rather than a plain text field open up interesting relationships. For example, link to multiple People or Organizations with a \u201cCustomers\u201d field. This also solves the problem of only being able to associate a Person with one, current Organization. If you want to track multiple relationships, whether a Person linked through an \u201cAdvisor\u201d field, or a \u201cUsed to Work At\u201d field continuing previous companies, this opens up that ability. Smarter Tools I\u2019m wanting to commit to a Personal CRM so I can work smarter, not harder. In the world of Contacts, Calendaring, To Dos, and Email, I\u2019m still not getting as much smarts as I want out of my tools. And of course, it\u2019s all about process. I\u2019m pretty good at Inbox Zero (as of writing, ~10 emails across 3 accounts), and I look forward to Highrise helping me get To Dos out of email even more. We can talk about agents and AI, but in many cases the reality of the interfaces and the silo-ized data models are still holding us back.
