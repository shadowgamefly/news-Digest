How do you take \u201cthe greatest story ever told\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa story around thousands of years and has been painted 100s of times, and make it your own? Answer: Idea sex! The most famous rendition is Da Vinci\u2019s \u201cThe Last Supper. \u201d Da Vinci was an amateur forensic doctor. He would cut up dead bodies to study, in great detail, all of the musculature, the bone structure, etc. A \u201cLast Supper\u201d painting from the 13th century (see one of the attached images, \u201csupper1\u201d) was mostly two dimensional. With no talking and no emotions on the faces despite the intensity of the dinner. An intensity that has made it \u201cthe greatest story ever told\u201d for 2000 years. Da Vinci\u2019s studies of human biology + his constant sketches of people talking in the street + \u201cthe greatest story ever told\u201d = one of the most famous paintings in history. And was Da Vinci\u2019s concept original? Of course not! The story was already 1400 years old and had been painted hundreds of times. Da Vinci made it his own. It became 100% original with his mastery of idea sex. Steve Jobs didn\u2019t invent the phone. The \u201cgenre\u201d of the phone had existed for a century. The iPhone is a \u201cphone\u201d in every way. He didn\u2019t invent the MP3 player either. But he combined ideas, moved the genre forward and created his own micro-category which became THE category of smart phones. And \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d didn\u2019t stop with Da Vinci. Every industry and art form is the product of thousands of generations of idea sex. Every single one. Check out the images attached to this post. A) Dali\u2019s surreal take: Da Vinci tried to be as realistic as possible. Dali combined surrealism with \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d. The transparent, ambisexual blonde Jesus, The ghostlike body floating above. The disciples backs facing us (not done before in prior paintings). B ) Fast forward to Andy Warhol: Da Vinci\u2019s painting + the Warhol-style silk screening of it he made famous in his portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Pop Art + The Last Supper = multi-million dollar painting. Fast forward to one of my favorite TV shows, Battlestar Galactica and their marketing poster based on The Last Supper. C) Battlestar Galactica: A poster for Battlestar Galactica (see attached) is: the battle between possibly semi-divine Cylons and humans (with a Judas) + Da Vinci\u2019s exact representation = beautiful marketing poster. A work of art. Every idea, every art, every business, is like a wedding dress. Something old, something new. The OLD is thousands of years of story, of emotional conditioning, of wars, of sickness, of \u201crules\u201d to help us conform. The NEW, is you and the pleasure and thoughts and excitements that are uniquely you. What makes YOU happy? It\u2019s a party in your brain! Do it with art. Do it with business. Do it for fun. Do it for love. Take an idea from 100 years ago. From yesterday. From 1000 years ago. From your friend. Tell a story around it in modern terms. Make it uniquely yours. You can even make it a joke.
