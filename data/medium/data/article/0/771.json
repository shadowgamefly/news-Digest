The really amazing implication here is that it\u2019s almost as if we have a suite of \u2018natural easing functions\u2019 hardwired into our brains that get loaded into our consciousness to predict the motion of an external object. A completely different and equally amazing implication is that we\u2019re able to cobble together complex velocity algorithms on the fly (or from a set of deeper library functions) from visual data in near realtime and load those results into our consciousness. We know from recent breakthroughs in neuroplasticity that the brain is an organ that organizes itself in response to its environment. It follows that structures in the brain that are environmentally determined are either reinforced by stimulation or they \u2018atrophy\u2019 through a lack of stimulation. If stimulated, more connections are made, and neurons are re-myelinated. The \u2018mind-map\u2019 reinforces itself and expands. If not stimulated, however, those regions are recruited by other regions and fade in dominance, or disappear altogether. This argument favors the idea that our favoring non-linear over linear comes from how our brains are organized around our environmental inputs, not necessarily a genetic reason. Therefore, designers who employ linear motion in their projects are not just missing an opportunity to create usability, they may also be negatively impacting it. The UX in Motion recommendation here is to always use eased motion. The question remains\u200a\u2014\u200aof the infinite possible easing values in existence, which are best? Should I use this curve or that curve? At this point there is no solid answer, but the hypothesis suggests a likely scenario where any eased motion will create better usability than linear motion. To conclude: the irony is that while linear motion is vastly \u2018simpler\u2019 and seemingly easier to grasp, it is in fact the non-linear, more complex motion that we seem to be adapted to, and which ultimately affects the quality of the user experience.
