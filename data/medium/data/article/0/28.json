Being adult largely depends on one\u2019s ability to manage these disappointments without being outwardly affected by them. The reason \u201cHow are you?\u201d is a ubiquitous greeting found in cultures and nations across the globe isn\u2019t that people truly care about how other people are feeling. The \u201ccorrect\u201d response to this query is, 99.999 percent of the time, \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cOK\u201d or \u201cFine.\u201d The incorrect response is always any honest answer. The purpose of \u201cHow are you?,\u201d as a purely rhetorical question, is to gauge whether a person is operating at a baseline level of emotional control or whether they\u2019re going to make things weird by accurately expressing their inner turmoil. And that\u2019s why I love Russell Westbrook\u2019s lies. He\u2019s like every other person in the world who says he doesn\u2019t care: [Extremely Ron Howard Voice] Actually, he does.
