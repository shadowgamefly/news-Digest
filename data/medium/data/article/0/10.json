I Am A Chinese\u00a0Tourist. I used to live in Hong Kong, but I was there recently on vacation. While at the top of The Peak having a coffee I struck up a conversation with woman who had been living in Central for over a decade but is from Australia. She had a dog and was very kind to him. Given her cosmopolitan persona and fondness for canines I was optimistic about the exchange. I asked about the changes she\u2019s seen in Hong Kong since being a resident. We spoke of political evolution, freedom of speech, and real estate prices. Then the conversation turned, as it usually does with Hong Kong residents, towards The Mainland Chinese. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many of them\u201d, she said. \u201cThey do all their luxury shopping here because it\u2019s cheaper than on the mainland. Busloads of them. And it\u2019s just getting\u00a0worse.\u201d I had already told her that I was born in mainland China in the same town as my father. I do not recall professing a deep self-loathing or otherwise invite this malice. But yet she very matter-of-factly said this with little self-awareness and even less empathy for millions of humans than she showed to her dog. The generalization was personal, and her disgust towards mainlanders was unmistakable. It was an automatic, unconscious response to the infestation of mainlanders descending on her adopted home. Her sentiment is common: in Hong Kong many citizens literally refer to mainlanders as locusts. A plague of imperial proportions. When SARS hit China it hit Hong Kong the hardest. Tourism and real estate, twin pillars of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, cratered. Chinese tourism and money from the public and private sectors poured in and effectively staved off an even greater recession.* Now that China has opened up its borders, the message from many Hong Kong residents to mainlanders\u200a\u2014\u200anot just the government, but the people themselves\u200a\u2014\u200ais simple: STAY OUT.

I\u2019ve talked to many local businesses all over the world who complain about the Chinese, but who readily accept their cash. *I\u2019m glossing over complex economic interconnectedness and political realities and addressing merely the sentiment of one people towards another people, not their governments or policies. We Are All Chinese\u00a0Tourists Nowadays there\u2019s a fetishization of the \u201ctraditional\u201d, and a premium placed on the authentic. Readers on Medium, especially, extoll the \u201cauthentic\u201d. Authentic local food. Authentic connections. Authentic experiences. And none more exhausting and self-defeating than Authentic Travel. Perhaps you\u2019ve read the same articles that I have. Like the one by a traveler who visited Cuba c. Nov 2016 who wanted to get their \u201cbefore it\u2019s ruined\u201d by everyone who comes after her. Or the solo backpacker who lived in a village in Togo and made bracelets with the female \u2018villagers\u2019. (They refer to themselves as \u2018people\u2019, btw). Now he sells the bracelets online, 100% of every purchase going back to that village! OK, now I\u2019m just being cynical and mean. But the point is this: Along the false dichotomy of Authentic vs. Inauthentic, who is to judge which is which? And why are we judging others\u2019 experiences in the first\u00a0place? If a historian two hundred years from now were to document the \u201cauthentic\u201d China and the \u201cauthentic\u201d America of today, I suspect they would dedicate more paragraphs to the Nike and Foxconn factories of Guangzhou\u200a\u2014\u200apistons of a global economic engine\u200a\u2014\u200athan they would the Forbidden City or old Hutong alleyways of Beijing. More footnotes on the decline of Detroit and our failing inner city public schools than on the Grand Canyon and Lady Liberty. On my last trip to Thailand I hired a private driver and his Land Cruiser to chauffeur me and my partner a couple hundred kilometers. We stayed at a four star boutique hotel (staffed by traditional local villagers/vegans, of course!), but also slept on the floor of an orphanage one night. How do you think we netted out on our travel authenticity index? Mark Twain said, Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one\u2019s lifetime. Isn\u2019t this part of why we all travel and want others to travel? To expand our horizons? To come back a little different than when we left? We should certainly neither applaud nor forgive littering on the streets and rudeness to wait-staff by anyone. At the same time, how should we judge those who don\u2019t like to queue up in your country when food rationing was still thing until 1996 in theirs? For whom bumping into you on the street is typical behavior in their congested home town of 11 million people with a sink-or-swim daily reality and where \u2018personal space\u2019 is a contradiction in terms? Should we reprimand those who quite possibly spent a lifetime under oppression and have only recently eeked out the means to see a world that they\u2019ve been told is the enemy for traveling by bus with a group of friends? Who wear colored hats because getting lost in a country where they don\u2019t speak the language would cause a panic attack? Source: World\u00a0Bank Americans have a carbon footprint of 16 metric tons per person per year. Chinese citizens generated one metric ton per year in 1960. Today Chinese folks produce seven metric tons per year per person on average.* If you do a couple of LAX-JFK trips a year plus an international work trip or two like I do, you blow either of these country\u2019s averages out of the water. Who, then, is a bigger drain on our collective resources? Me and my fellow global citizens savoring our avocado toast and ros\u00e9 with brunch, burning high octane jet fuel on eco-friendly Dreamliners like it\u2019s our job\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it sort of is? Or the family of three visiting Las Vegas for the first and only time? Who will talk about\u200a\u2014\u200afor the rest of their lives\u200a\u2014\u200atheir stay at Circus! Circus! with fond memories and \u201ctacky\u201d paraphernalia. Whose lives are changed more and, potentially, for the better? I\u2019m not suggesting Blackjack Bobby Chen is a better traveler than me. Or vice versa. I\u2019m suggesting it\u2019s not my place to judge. My Mom Is A Chinese\u00a0Tourist My mom is effervescent and charming. She\u2019s spent the second half of her life in Kansas and California. She will never live in China again because she says, \u201cThe people are rude, and it\u2019s too dirty and crowded.\u201d When I lived in Saudi Arabia and the UAE she came by herself and visited me for a week. During my days at work she explored the souks and chatted with men, which I told her was a tad out of the ordinary, but awesome. My mom with slightly confused but happy shopkeepers in Dubai. Complete with awkward arm\u00a0wrap. Despite her Dora-like penchant for exploration, she still craves Chinese food if she doesn\u2019t have it for more than two days. It turns out, she\u2019s also not a big fan of chickpeas. \u201cDo we have to eat this \u2018hoommus\u2019 again? It\u2019s sort of like\u00a0mud.\u201d When we were in Jerusalem I Yelped a Chinese restaurant for lunch one day. It was pretty terrible, but it was exactly what she and I both wanted. Mom is still more comfortable speaking Chinese even though she\u2019s medium-fluent in English. She\u2019s resourceful, and would be able to get by in most places, but she doesn\u2019t get why I travel to some developing countries for fun. \u201cVietnam is so poor!\u201d She exclaimed when I told her I was going to there for a\u00a0month. \u201cWe left China to leave that behind. No, thank you. I\u2019ve seen enough poverty for one lifetime.\u201d She and her husband now aspire to travel twice a year. Their most recent trip was to Alaska on a Carnival Cruise. They couldn\u2019t get enough of the crab legs at the buffet. Chinese people love buffets with crab legs. Especially Alaskan crab legs in Alaska. This year they want to go to Spain with some friends. And look; I get it. Some tour groups who happen to be Chinese do suck sometimes. But this year for my mom\u2019s 61st birthday I will gift her that trip to Spain. And it will be with a Chinese tour group. \u6500\u6500 You made it! Click that \u2764. It\u2019s soooo easy\u00a0:) \u54c7\u585e\uff01\u60a8\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\uff01\u8bf7\u6309 \u2764.
