The most famous one in recent years\u200a\u2014\u200aand arguably one of the most philosophically important adjustments in league history\u200a\u2014\u200awas when Golden State head coach Steve Kerr removed center Andrew Bogut from the Warriors\u2019 starting lineup in favor of small forward Andre Iguodala during the 2015 NBA Finals against Cleveland, who were up 2\u20131 at the time. At the behest of a millennial assistant, Kerr birthed the so-called \u201cLineup of Death,\u201d and Golden State won the next three games by a combined 42 points. Such creative epiphanies, though, only get squeezed out of the desperation that\u2019s created by the day-after-day repetition of a playoff series. And sometimes, like when Gregg Popovich swapped Boris Diaw for Tiago Splitter in the 2014 Finals between the Spurs and the Heat, the adjustment is a personnel change paired with a more subtle strategic shift. (It\u2019s not a coincidence that these brilliant adjustments both came against LeBron James. His versatility forces coaches to go beyond the borders of conventional basketball thought.) \u201cEvery time, it was the same thing,\u201d Mika Honkasalo, an NBA analyst and a basketball coach in Finland, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a hedge on the ball screen, and then [the Spurs] hit it to the top of the key. Diaw or someone basically knows what the rotations are with his eyes closed. Their players can execute so well that it was basically just playing the same math problem over again.\u201d That\u2019s often how it feels when a coach makes an unadjustable adjustment: as if he and his players just put the finishing touches on an elegant, multi-chalkboard equation. No matter how good the opposing coaching staff is and how talented their players are, they\u2019re powerless against a game plan that\u2019s suddenly become inevitable. A year ago, Honkasalo conducted a study to determine what kinds of teams outperform or underperform their playoff expectations. In other words, compared with their regular-season numbers, which teams did better in the postseason and which teams did worse? He found that teams with higher defensive efficiency ratings tended to exceed expectations, and teams with higher offensive efficiency ratings performed worse than expected. (But teams with high effective field goal percentages also exceeded expectation, suggesting that teams that rely on free throws aren\u2019t as dangerous in the postseason. Rockets fans, you can enjoy the uncertainty of rooting for a team that excels at both.) The study also found that teams with high offensive rebounding rates tended to perform worse come playoff time, and teams that shared the ball more tended to perform better. Why the changes? Honkasalo said it\u2019s the adjustment saturation. During the regular season, the best-prepared teams can beat up on opponents whose game plans and gameplay aren\u2019t vacuum-tight. Teams like this year\u2019s Spurs and Heat exploit, Honkasalo said, \u201cthe dumb advantages like the lazy box outs or the transition running.\u201d But once the postseason begins, every team is prepared, so the game slows down, transition-scoring rates plummet, and the easy offensive-rebound opportunities no longer present themselves. In a macro sense, coaching actually evens out in the postseason. Russell Westbrook built his MVP candidacy by turning basketball into football: exploding through disorganized defenses and leading the league in fast-break points per game. In the playoffs, though, the Thunder will have to rely more often on a half-court offense that finished the year 25th in the NBA in points per possession. As for their first-round opponent? The Rockets were the best half-court offense in the league. The Five Plays You Need to Know About Heading Into the NBA PlayoffsFrom mutated pick-and-rolls to off-kilter handoffs, here\u2019s how your favorite team is going to get easy bucketstheringer.com \u201cIt\u2019s still basketball, and the players are still going to decide it,\u201d Carlesimo said. \u201cBut there are a lot fewer elements left to chance.\u201d With the increased prep time and the familiarity that comes with the repetitive schedule, weaknesses that might skirt by on a Tuesday night at the Barclays Center get put under a spotlight in May and June. If a wing player on a certain team can\u2019t hit 3-pointers at an efficient rate, opponents will barely pay any attention to him. \u201c[In the 2015 Western Conference semifinals], Steve Kerr just didn\u2019t guard [Grizzlies shooting guard] Tony Allen, but he put [center Andrew] Bogut on him,\u201d McHale said. \u201cAnd Bogut was just a roamer. And that gave them a whole different look defensively.\u201d If a big man can\u2019t defend against a smaller lineup, he\u2019ll see his playing time dwindle\u200a\u2014\u200aas happened with Bogut in the Finals over the past two seasons. And if a big man can score but can\u2019t anchor a defense, he might have a place on the second unit of a top team in the regular season, but in the playoffs he\u2019ll get stapled to the bench. \u201cIf you\u2019re [Golden State\u2019s] JaVale McGee, you can\u2019t play defense against a good team,\u201d Honkasalo said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand all the nuances of where you\u2019re supposed to stand. When he plays against the well-prepared, good team, that just doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d Playoff defense is more creative and less forgiving. Even though the worst offenses in the league don\u2019t make it beyond the 82nd game, efficiency and scoring rates tend to decrease in the postseason. Catch-and-shoot scorers like Kyle Korver and Klay Thompson no longer have as much space for their jump shots, and their percentages drop once the calendar hits mid-April. Yet while the threat Korver and Thompson pose still creates space for an offense, an inefficient scorer like DeRozan crumples amid the increased pressure. This year, over 90 percent of his shots have come from within the 3-point arc, so DeRozan has to make those shots at an incredibly high rate in order to still be an effective scorer. It\u2019s the whole \u201cthree is more than two\u201d thing. He pulls off that tight-rope act in the regular season, but it\u2019s just harder to make shots in the playoffs, and so if DeRozan\u2019s field goal percentage drops even just a few points, he becomes a net negative on offense. In the playoffs, he shoots a full 5 percentage points worse from the field. Eight years into his career, it\u2019s clear that DeRozan can be the lead scorer on a great offensive team\u200a\u2014\u200aduring the regular season. Once the playoffs start, though, his game looks completely out of place. If DeRozan is the prototypical regular-season player, then Irving was made for the playoffs. \u201c[Defenses] just know whatever play is going to come,\u201d Carlesimo said. \u201cYou know what I mean? They\u2019re more wired in. If there is a call, they know what\u2019s going to happen, so it comes down to more execution and individual creativity than it does what a team is doing.\u201d No one in the NBA is better at combining individual creativity and execution than Irving. Among players with at least 1.5 isolation possessions per game, almost no one scores at a higher rate (1.12 per possession) than the Cleveland point guard. And among players with at least 200 iso possessions this season, no one else breaks 1.05. (DeRozan, at 1.02, comes in a distant third behind Irving and Damian Lillard.) Irving\u2019s combination of individual efficiency and raw production puts him on his own level. During the regular season last year, Cleveland\u2019s net rating was slightly better with Irving off the court. Once the playoffs hit, though, they were better off with him in the game by 1.5 points per possession. Some of that is likely due to a more dialed-in and more prepared defense that\u2019s able to carry some of Irving\u2019s inadequacies on that end\u200a\u2014\u200aand maybe his own defensive performance improves too\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s also because there\u2019s no adjustment to be made against an incredible one-on-one scorer. \u201cHe\u2019s not good at the stuff that can be taken away,\u201d Honkasalo said. In other words, he\u2019s good at the one thing a great defense is helpless against. By the time teams reach the Finals, if defensive game plans are fully optimized and each team has planned for every set the opponent throws at it, sometimes there is no series-deciding adjustment to make. In that case, an efficient isolation scorer serves as a fail-safe for offenses that get diminished by prepared and aggressive postseason defenses. Last year, it was enough to give the Cavs one final push over the wall. Is there a secret to solving the playoffs? For one, go get LeBron James. His teams always exceed expectation because he\u2019s LeBron James and you\u2019re not. But is there a new way teams should play once they hit April? Before the league\u2019s pace of play was put through a particle accelerator, the Memphis Grizzlies were able to, despite never earning more than a 4-seed, turn every game into something like a coin flip. Those odds don\u2019t work in the regular season, but you\u2019ll take it against the Warriors or the Spurs. \u201cThere was real stuff that they did to make that happen,\u201d Honkasalo said. \u201cLimit 3-pointers\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh-variance stuff\u200a\u2014\u200aand keep the games slow. Get the variance out of it, keep it close. Play a 50\u201350 game and hope you win\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s the logic.\u201d Under new coach David Fizdale, the Grizzlies have dragged their heels toward the pace-and-space era. While that slow evolution has allowed them to push an aging core into the playoffs for a seventh straight year, it doesn\u2019t necessarily portend postseason success. They play the Spurs in Round 1, and San Antonio is essentially just a much better version of what Memphis has become. Are LeBron\u2019s Cavaliers Playoff Scary?Or are they just regular scary? Let\u2019s consult the NBA playoffs fear index.theringer.com The best squads want better than coin-flip odds. Teams spend the entire season crafting their identities, smoothing out their defensive rotations, and fine-tuning their offensive philosophies. The playoffs require an incredible level of execution\u200a\u2014\u200aone that only seems possible after a regular season\u2019s worth of preparation. Suddenly shifting toward a playoff-optimized strategy would be its own kind of disaster. \u201cIf your identity just changes in the playoffs, you have problems,\u201d McHale said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be an extension of who you are. I promise you, Houston is not gonna come out now and shoot like one 3-pointer, and say, \u2018Haha, we tricked you all year.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s fun to imagine Popovich, Celtics head coach Brad Stevens, and even Cleveland\u2019s Tyronn Lue\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019ll believe him\u200a\u2014\u200aas these grand masters of multidimensional chess, directing their players to take a strange number of midrange shots or play bad pick-and-roll defense so as to distract opponents from a never-before-used game plan they\u2019re waiting to unveil until the playoffs. But the margin for error in the postseason just doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything that hasn\u2019t been drilled to the point of being airtight. If the regular season is figuring out how to run your stuff, the postseason is figuring out how your stuff works against whoever you\u2019re playing. It\u2019s just that some teams are better positioned to succeed as the playoffs begin. The basketball-adjacent world is watching and the emotional stakes do have an effect\u200a\u2014\u200ahow else to explain a certain then-Miami star\u2019s performance in 2011?\u200a\u2014\u200abut those changes are intangible, unpredictable, and, ultimately, the negatives and the positives likely cancel each other out. Playoff basketball is tangibly different because coaches and players have more time to prepare and rest, the easy advantages that can be mined in mid-February all but disappear in April, and defenses get optimized toward their opponent. In the face of that, some offenses still work, just in a reduced or more painstaking fashion, while others collapse under the new effort required to hide their inefficiencies. Once every possible adjustment is made, though, it gets pretty simple: If our guy can beat your guy, we\u2019re probably going to win.
