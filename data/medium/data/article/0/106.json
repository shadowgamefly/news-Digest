Thompson can step dramatically back and launch up an off-balance swish; he can even occasionally convert a setup from Curry into a high-flying, one-handed dunk.

In general, he tends to carry himself on the court less like a slick NBA player and more like a quiet tennis pro fiddling with the strings of his racket between points. During idle moments, Thompson often kicks at his hands with the bottoms of each shoe, as if he\u2019s getting ready to receive serve. His default gait is a back-to-the-baseline trudge.

(Durant joked to KNBR that the group of Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala were so tight that they \u201call walked in and it looked like they were holding hands.\u201d) Durant chose Golden State on the Fourth of July, and once majority owner Joe Lacob finished celebrating the news from his vacation home in Montana, he told KNBR, his first thought was about the nuts and bolts of fitting in another star: \u201cWhat we got to do now?\u201d Kevin Durant on the Moment When He Thought His Season Was Over\u201cI just burst out crying,\u201d the All-Star says of his reaction to thinking he\u2019d broken his tibiatheringer.com Adding Durant to a stacked franchise coming off a record-setting 73-win regular season was exhilarating but also mildly worrisome. On the one hand, it\u2019s Durant, end of story. On the other, why monkey with chemistry and mess with success? During his years in Oklahoma City, Durant took between 17 and 21 shots per game, and fitting in that kind of volume on a team that was third in the league in field goal attempts the season prior would be no easy task. But Thompson bristled at suggestions that he might be one of the players who would have to relinquish some touches in order to clear space for Durant. \u201cI feel kind of disrespected that people keep using the term \u2018sacrifice\u2019 to describe me and describe us,\u201d he told The Vertical\u2019s Shams Charania in August. \u201cWe all want to see each other do well. But I\u2019m not sacrificing shit, because my game isn\u2019t changing. I\u2019m still going to try to get buckets, hit shots, come off screens. I want to win and have a fun time every game we play.\u201d Indeed, Thompson hasn\u2019t sacrificed shit. His game hasn\u2019t changed\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept to get even better. Somehow, despite being on a team with Curry and Green and Iguodala and Durant, Thompson is averaging more shot attempts this season, 17.7, than he ever has before. In addition to his 3-point prowess, his shorter-range game has become more of a threat; he makes 51.7 percent of the 2-point shots he puts up, and that number has gone up in each season since 2013. Meanwhile, Durant, who returned to the Warriors on April 8 after sitting out 19 games with a knee injury, is the one taking fewer shots per game than he\u2019s used to. \u201cYou gotta give Kevin a lot of credit,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cbecause, his style of play? He would fit in anywhere, and especially here. He fits so perfectly because he doesn\u2019t need to dominate the ball to be a force. I think he\u2019s averaging his least amount of field goal attempts, maybe even in his career, but it might be one of his more efficient seasons.\u201d (He\u2019s right: Durant\u2019s 16.6 shots per game are his lowest since entering the league, but his 53.5 field goal percentage is his best.) \u201cWith Kevin now,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cwe have obviously three guys, with me, Kev and Steph, who can have a big night on any given night and so draw a lot of attention. Dray is like the key that unlocks everything we do, because he\u2019s so versatile. We\u2019ve got guys like Andre and Shaun, and you can\u2019t forget about the bigs who get us open, like Zaza and JaVale. We have such a unique talent pool on this team.\u201d That embarrassment of riches, though, initially led to some doubts around the league; the concern-trolly assessment \u201cthere\u2019s only one basketball\u201d became a frequent refrain. During the same KNBR appearance where Thompson talked happily about naps, he was also asked about the \u201cone basketball\u201d dig. \u201cThere\u2019s one ball,\u201d he responded. \u201cGuess what we\u2019ll do? We\u2019ll put it in the hoop.\u201d Thompson puts the ball in the hoop a hell of a lot, and when he really gets going, it\u2019s impossible to look away. He can receive and release the ball faster and more cleanly than anyone else: 11.6 of his points per game this season are considered catch-and-shoot, the most in the league; the second-place player, Dirk Nowitzki, gets 7.9 points per game that way. Thompson can step dramatically back and launch up an off-balance swish; he can even occasionally convert a setup from Curry into a high-flying, one-handed dunk. Earlier this season, against the Pacers, Thompson popped off for 60 points, a career-high for him and a rough night for his former Warriors captain, Monta Ellis, whom he lit entirely up. As a testament to Thompson\u2019s speedy, lethal release, ESPN\u2019s Tom Haberstroh and Brian Windhorst calculated that Thompson dribbled just 11 times on those 60 points, and that he had the ball in his hands for just a minute and a half total. And last year, in the Western Conference finals against Durant\u2019s Thunder, Thompson practically single-handedly saved the Warriors season, hitting 11 3-pointers in a Game 6 comeback effort. Thompson\u2019s performance earned a tremendously dorky We Are Not Worthy display from Lacob in the tunnel after the game, and the Warriors went on to win the series in seven. \u201cHe just has got no conscience,\u201d says big man JaVale McGee. (Warriors guard Ian Clark offers an uncannily similar assessment: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a conscience.\u201d) \u201cHe can shoot anywhere, over everybody,\u201d says McGee. \u201cSomebody can be right in his face and he\u2019ll shoot and it will go in. Anyone else it would be like, \u2018That\u2019s a bad shot.\u2019 But he makes the bad shots. So those are good shots for him.\u201d Thompson\u2019s perimeter play doesn\u2019t just stand out on offense, however. A number of his teammates and coaches are quick to point out that defensively, he has some of the most important assignments around the arc. After his rookie season, Thompson spent a month in the Bay Area working with coaches specifically on his defense. (\u201cThat helped a lot,\u201d he says.) \u201cHe\u2019s definitely in shape,\u201d says Clark, \u201cand he has to be, to be able to guard one, two, three, sometimes four men while switching. We do a lot of switching. He can guard both sides.\u201d Thompson says he\u2019s lucky to be \u201cblessed with stamina,\u201d and rattles off a greatest hits of NBA players, ranging from Russell Westbrook and James Harden to C.J. McCollum and LeBron James, when asked whom he most enjoys defending. \u201cKlay is one of those guys,\u201d Adams says, \u201cwho never gets enough credit for what he does. Let\u2019s think about what he does. He guards, in many cases, the best perimeter player on the other team. Might be a point guard, might be an off-guard. So he has tremendous defensive responsibilities to begin a game. And he\u2019s pretty much relentless from start to finish. Yeah, he\u2019ll lose focus on a play or two, but it\u2019s amazing the energy that he\u2019s putting into the defensive end guarding a significant, if not the significant, player on the other team, as well as playing his offense.\u201d According to the NBA\u2019s SportVU speed-and-distance metric, which tracks a player\u2019s movement around the court, Thompson covers 2.45 miles of ground during a game, 12th-most in the league, thanks to all of his looping, quick cuts, and rangy defense. The only Warrior who beats that is the slippery Curry\u200a\u2014\u200aby just one-tenth of a mile. Thompson and Curry were given the collective nickname the Splash Brothers in 2012, and they\u2019ve always been a compelling yin-and-yang on the team: the suave superstar Curry, with his maniacal grins and showmanship, and the more understated Thompson, with his deadpan humor and clockwork mechanics. Thompson is a proud and confident player, but he\u2019s also a low-key guy who doesn\u2019t seek out the spotlight. And on a team that has turned into a cornucopia of top NBA talent, Thompson can sometimes fly under the radar from a promotional standpoint: In the pump-up video played before Warriors games in Oracle, his relative screen time makes him look like a second, third, even fourth fiddle. Whichever fiddle he is or should be, Thompson is certainly known for marching to the beat of his own drum. While Curry and Durant are sponsored by Under Armour and Nike, respectively, Thompson endorses Anta, a powerhouse brand in China\u200a\u2014\u200ain January, Chinese president Xi Jinping sported its winter wear\u200a\u2014\u200abut has almost no presence, other than online, in the U.S. (When the Warriors were wooing Durant, Thompson diffused a potentially tense discussion about shoe sponsors with a wry Anta-related joke.) Thompson, who says he loves traveling, went to China in 2015, a trip that yielded a that\u2019s-so-Klay viral video of him trying new food and included a push-up contest in which basketballs were balanced on the back of his neck. \u201cKT has thousands of fans in China,\u201d Ding Shizhong, the chairman and CEO of Anta Sports, says via email through a translator, \u201cand his multi-city tour in 2015 was a sensation and a dream come true for many fans.\u201d Thompson is one of several Warriors players who is a hot enough commodity for the media that the Warriors tend to put him in the press conference room even after run-of-the-mill regular-season games, the way they do with Curry, Durant, and Green, rather than subject him to the claustrophobia of being surrounded by NBA Finals\u2013sized scrums of microphones and cameras at his locker. He is pleasant and offbeat and subtly hilarious up on the dais, but he always looks like he\u2019d rather be somewhere, anywhere else. It\u2019s become tradition for Thompson to say near the end of his pressers, hopefully but not unkindly: Is that it? or Am I done here? then hop up, chipper and relieved, like a fidgety kid finally being excused from the dinner table. Not only did he take a swig of beer in one postgame interview in November, he followed it up with a satisfied \u201cahhh.\u201d Another time, when he did linger at the interview table longer than he had to, it was to fashion what he described as the \u201cbest paper airplane on the West Coast.\u201d McGee says that Thompson reminds him of Wilson Chandler in terms of general laidbackitude; Durant joked at his introductory press conference that he was surprised Thompson owned a cellphone. But while Thompson isn\u2019t chatty, he\u2019s as competitive as they come. He remembers walking off baseball diamonds midgame as a kid while playing with his dad, Mychal, and brothers Trayce and Mychel, fuming over some perceived slight or another. His whole family has this same sports bug. Mychal won two titles with the Los Angeles Lakers in the \u201980s; Trayce is part of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. (During an on-field interview with Trayce at Dodger Stadium last September, Klay\u2019s dog, Rocco, in full view of the cameras, pooped on the pristine infield.) Mychel is on the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA Development League, and their mother, Julie, played volleyball at both the University of Portland and the University of San Francisco. Klay says that even now, when he\u2019s with his brothers, he can sometimes get walk-out-the-door-level heated over ping-pong, golf, or the video game FIFA. (Trayce, Klay says, is probably the best at the first two games, but Klay thinks he has a leg up in the third.) Last season, during the NBA Finals, Thompson told ESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe that he remembers exactly who was taken before him in the draft\u200a\u2014\u200aand that, in particular, he had a bone to pick with the Sacramento Kings, who thanks to a draft-day trade wound up with Jimmer Fredette at no. 10, one spot ahead of Thompson. \u201cI considered myself the best shooter in that draft,\u201d he told Lowe \u201cso when someone took another shooter over me, it was a slap in the face.\u201d You might say that, ultimately, Thompson slapped back. In the third quarter of a January 2015 game against those Kings, Thompson hit 13-of-13 shots in the third quarter alone, good for 37 points, an NBA record for points in a quarter. (After he was fouled on one play before taking a shot, he even went on to sink a just-for-the-hell-of-it long 3.) Even watching the truncated highlights on YouTube is a transcendent, delightful experience, and that\u2019s already knowing that all the shots will go in. To imagine being there that night and watching Thompson sink try after try, some of those baskets coming in the form of absurd heat checks that would be terrible shots from most anyone else, is to know bliss. \u201cIt felt like it happened so fast,\u201d Thompson says of that game. \u201cAlmost everything had to go perfectly for me to get 37; that would be hard for me to do again. I still can\u2019t believe some of the stuff I do sometimes in this league. I have to pinch myself and be thankful for it.\u201d One of the best things about that Kings game was how much fun Thompson was outwardly, openly having. In general, he tends to carry himself on the court less like a slick NBA player and more like a quiet tennis pro fiddling with the strings of his racket between points. During idle moments, Thompson often kicks at his hands with the bottoms of each shoe, as if he\u2019s getting ready to receive serve. His default gait is a back-to-the-baseline trudge. When he misses a shot, he scuffs his feet down the court on defense, quietly berating himself, sometimes clapping his hands a tiny bit in personal frustration. Against Sacramento in 2015, though, he put on a performance so exciting that it left his then-teammate David Lee doing the surrender cobra in disbelief at midcourt, and inspired Iguodala, on the bench in street clothes, to capture some Thompson moments on his phone. Which probably made for some rare footage, because Thompson was all hops, leaps, chest-bumps, and smiles that night\u200a\u2014\u200anot exactly his usual demeanor. \u201cI would categorize Klay as a very private player,\u201d Adams says. \u201cHe\u2019s emotional, but his emotions don\u2019t always show themselves. He has some sort of internal process that he uses, so it makes it look like he\u2019s pretty calm and collected\u200a\u2014\u200awhich he is, in many ways\u200a\u2014\u200abut don\u2019t think that there are not a lot of emotional juices flowing through that body.\u201d Zaza Pachulia, the team\u2019s center, uses the word \u201cspecial\u201d three times and the word \u201cspecialness\u201d once as he tries to capture his teammate\u2019s vibe. \u201cWe all have our different personalities,\u201d Pachulia says, \u201cbut he loves big moments, he loves big games. I\u2019ve seen him get emotional. Like, when he had 60 points? His tongue goes out, a little, maybe on the 50th point.\u201d Klay Thompson is feeling great, and this time it\u2019s easy to tell. It\u2019s later that night, after the April 4 shootaround, and he\u2019s on the court against the Minnesota Timberwolves, in the midst of a 41-point effort, hitting his usual 3s, allowing a few tiny satisfied smiles, and sometimes feeling brazen enough to successfully drive the lane. (\u201cI can handle the ball,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the ball moves faster when you pass the ball than it does when you\u2019re dribbling.\u201d) With 5:47 to play in the game, though, just before he\u2019s finally subbed out with a double-digit lead and an appreciative ovation, he pulls up for a long farewell 3 that misses, and he shakes his head as he runs back on defense, chastising himself, his brow more furrowed than usual. Even after 41 points, he hates missing out on 44. In the postgame press conference, after a reporter asks what has enabled Thompson to go on such a tear over the past month, he adjusts the mic, his expression blank, and says: \u201cI\u2019ll probably say the weather\u2019s gotten better. The sunshine\u2019s been so good to me. Whenever I go outside it just puts me in a great mood.\u00a0\u2026 That\u2019s a big part of it, and I\u2019m not even kidding.\u201d He isn\u2019t. \u201cHis face is the same whether he has 41 or four,\u201d Curry says after the game at his own press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same expression. It\u2019s a tough read.\u201d Kerr, in his postgame remarks, says that Thompson is, \u201cso poker-faced, he\u2019s so stoic, however you want to put it. [But] when he makes two or three in a row, and he\u2019s got a little bounce in his step, then you know he\u2019s gonna pull up from 40 feet in transition next time. And if he makes that one\u200a\u2014\u200anow you can really feel it. And he made a couple of those tonight.\u201d Steve Kerr on His \u201cSupervillain\u201d Team, the Magic of Steph, and How Brady Compares to MJThe Warriors coach sits down for a wide-ranging conversation on \u2018The B.S. Podcast\u2019theringer.com But Kerr also praises Thompson\u2019s defense. \u201cIn general,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat I\u2019d like to say about Klay is his defense is so important to us, putting pressure on the ball. He\u2019s had a spectacular season. The shooting, we know about, but it\u2019s everything he does for us at both ends.\u201d With the Warriors set to begin their quest for a third straight NBA Finals appearance, Thompson\u2019s clutch, daggerlike shooting and perimeter defense will be indispensable even on a team that appears to have parts to spare. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be a franchise player on a team,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cbut I look at it this way: Being on the Warriors, I have a chance to be on a team that can leave a legacy for generations to come, just like the Showtime Lakers, or the Celtics, or the Lakers\u2019 three-peat team. To be a part of that? That would be amazing, better than any individual stat or award. To leave an imprint on my city, and have a fan base love you forever? That\u2019s what I cherish, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really cool about our situation.\u201d Is there any sacrifice involved in achieving that goal? \u201cNo sacrifice,\u201d Thompson says, with a flat voice but the slightest hint of a smile. \u201cNo, no.\u201d ", "name": "106", "child": "106_1\t106_2\t106_3\t106_4\t106_5\t106_6\t106_7\t106_8\t106_9\t106_10\t106_11\t106_12", "timestamp": "Apr 12"}
