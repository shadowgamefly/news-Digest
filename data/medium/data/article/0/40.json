Russ pump-faked, Zaza went up, Russ leaned into him, and then Zaza clobbered him. Russ fell backward from the blow, immediately grabbing his face (Zaza looked to have hit him during the tangling), and then Zaza stood over him, glaring, snarling, radiating evil. It was a neat moment. But it went unfinished.

That means we\u2019d get a Warriors-Thunder second-round matchup, and that series would 100 percent be over quickly, but it\u2019d at least give Westbrook a minimum of four games to try to flake away Durant\u2019s self-worth. He could just do things like\u200a\u2014\u200aOK, let\u2019s say every time Durant hit a shot or whatever, Russ could stand near him and talk loudly enough that Durant could hear him but not so loud that it could be taken as Russ talking to him.

That\u2019s Roberson when he gets the ball. It\u2019s wild to watch. Draymond, who was \u201c\u201cguarding\u201d\u201d Roberson during the game, sagged off of him 10, 15, 20 feet every time. There was one play where Roberson caught the ball on the left wing and Draymond legit just walked to the bench and sat down while Roberson prayed for all of the electricity in America to shut off so he could just set the ball on the floor and walk away without anyone seeing him.

But what I\u2019m saying is that, I mean, it just makes things a little less interesting as an observer. It\u2019s fantastic to watch the Warriors when they get into their Total Team Destruction mode and do something silly like have 38 assists on 45 shots for the game or whatever. That\u2019s great and beautiful basketball, obviously. It\u2019s just that sometimes I miss a good Kevin Durant iso, you know what I\u2019m saying?
