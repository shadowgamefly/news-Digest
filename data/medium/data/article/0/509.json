Vance and countless other Middletown natives who have left, most never to return) that prioritizes facts and thinking. But for myriad reasons, Middletown seems to fail on this front, and if you live in this general vicinity, as I have with my family for the past eleven years, you\u2019ve heard lots of talk about Middletown schools.

I don\u2019t consider myself remarkably engaged in these pursuits; in a typical day throughout my life, I\u2019ve spent one to two hours per day consuming news and current events media and thinking about the topics, and I view that as a general baseline among many people of my acquaintance around the world and throughout my 45 years. I never cast a vote without having researched the candidate by at least reading the basic information published by a local newspaper, a local TV or radio station, and the League of Women Voters; I never fail to review my sample ballot prior to showing up to vote. And again, these are things I was taught to do\u200a\u2014\u200ain public school in New England, by my parents, and by the communities in which I lived.

Republican State Representative Candice Keller was elected in November 2016 to succeed outgoing term-limited Republican state representative Tim Derickson in Ohio\u2019s 53rd state congressional district. Upon his resignation in favor of a post in Governor John Kasich\u2019s administration, Keller was appointed to serve the remainder of Derickson\u2019s term, from mid-November 2016 to the official start of her term in January of 2017. Keller, for the past 8 years the executive director of Middletown\u2019s Community Pregnancy Center, seems to be new on the political scene, having first appeared in the fray contending for leadership of the Butler County Republican Women\u2019s Club in 2014. Source: http://www.journal-news.com/news/complaint-filed-over-presidential-election-the-gop-women-club/SHXpZFp25XxjvVtDSx00rM/ Mrs. Keller (I believe this is her preferred form of address, and thus I\u2019m using it in deference to that belief, instead of simply using her last name as is my usual style) has been vocal on some positions, espousing platforms such as imprisoning politicians who support sanctuary cities and eliminating funding for an access to women\u2019s health services. But she\u2019s also been silent on others, such as Ohio\u2019s budget shortfall\u200a\u2014\u200aa topic under much bipartisan discussion among lawmakers deeply concerned with the implication for local and county governments. Full document available from Cincinnati Right To\u00a0Life Despite Mrs. Keller\u2019s Christian charity\u200a\u2014\u200awhich I presume to be the one for which I found a gofundme\u200a\u2014\u200apleas from fellow Christians for compassion in the happening-right-now deportation of local mother Maribel Trujillo Diaz did not appear to reach her, as she commented: \u201cYou know, these situations are unfortunate, but this is a nation of laws, and this is a state of laws,\u201d Keller said. \u201cPeople have to be held responsible when they break even one law, and if a person is here illegally, they have broken a law. The detail about her having four children, I mean everyone who breaks the law these days just about has children, and if they are put in jail, whether they are here legally or not legally, they\u2019re going to be separated from their children.\u201d Well then. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what I remember Jesus saying on this when I read through the entirety of \u201cGood News For Modern Man,\u201d contrasting it with the battered King James my father had had since his youth as a Southern Baptist, and an 1890s \u201cThe Story of The Bible.\u201d That\u2019s definitely what I was taught at San Vicente de Paul. That\u2019s definitely the Christianity espoused by my devout friends of many Christian faiths: you break one law, and chuck you, farley, no quarter given. Yeah, not so much. Seriously, every day I live here I am shocked and appalled by the things that people say and do while calling themselves Christians. I don\u2019t call myself any kind of religious, but every day, man, I\u2019m like \u201cDude, I know Christians, Christians are friends of mine, and you, ma\u2019am\u2026 you\u2026 I just\u2026 wow.\u201d Perhaps Mrs. Keller is behind the suggestion I\u2019ve seen floated that, hey, you\u2019re right, deporting a local mother and separating her from her kids is kinda mean, so let\u2019s deport her special needs three-year-old too, even though all her kids are US citizens. Who knows? I presume some local Christian is, since it appears that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got in office around here. But this is just the tip of an iceberg that is barely in view, mere months into Mrs. Keller\u2019s time in office. I live in the next county over, so I didn\u2019t know her in her pre-government role in one of the region\u2019s many \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d like those known for pushing disinformation on pregnant people in distress and injecting it into the community narrative to compete with actual facts. Now, to be fair to Mrs. Keller, it\u2019s likely that as a long-time resident of Middletown, she has suffered some of the educational disadvantage rampant in that city\u2019s school district (of which my own husband is a graduate, and which does not compete with Lebanon in football, lest I be accused of simple town-based partisanship). What are my criteria for saying Middletown is a region experiencing long-term educational disadvantage? Well, for my part, while my academic peers and I were attending Socratic seminars on writing and thinking and spending our summers on museum internships and AP classes at elite private prep schools, my husband\u2019s peer group was in \u201cMarriage and the Family\u201d class getting ready for not one, but two, mock weddings intended to prepare them for the immediate reality of their lives. My parents\u2019 caste, for lack of a better word, went on sabbaticals from their tenured professor lives, spending a year in Paris or London, or scraping by on grant money while a grad student rents and sublets the house during the doctoral research year in Peru. My in-laws\u2019 caste poured out of Middletown burbclaves in the morning, worked at local industry, and gradually accepted commutes to Cincinnati and Dayton, bemoaning the longer commutes home making them miss their kids\u2019 sporting events at Middletown High School and nearby Bishop Fenwick Catholic high school. Common \u201cgetting up to no good\u201d in my high school years involved weed, Robert Fripp, and Kafka; in my husband\u2019s, it involved drunk driving and teen pregnancy and parenthood. But don\u2019t take my arguably snobbish word for it. Here\u2019s what Middletown native and Eli (that\u2019s what people from my parents\u2019 caste often call folks who went to Yale, put it in your mental crossword-puzzle-words file) has to say on it: \u201cAnd yet there was no sense that failing to achieve higher education would bring shame or any other consequences. The message wasn\u2019t explicit; teachers didn\u2019t tell us that we were too stupid or too poor to make it. Nevertheless, it was all around us, like the air we breathed: No one in our families had gone to college; older friends and siblings were perfectly content to stay in Middletown, regardless of their career prospects; we knew no one at a prestigious out-of-state school; and everyone knew at least one young adult who was underemployed or didn\u2019t have a job at all. In Middletown, 20 percent of the public high school\u2019s entering freshmen won\u2019t make it to graduations. Most won\u2019t graduate from college. Virtually no one will go to college out of state.\u201d \u2014 VANCE, J. D. (2016). Hillbilly elegy: a memoir of a family and culture in crisis. So, anyway, yeah, there\u2019s no reason to conclude that Mrs. Keller is even necessarily aware of the potential educational disadvantage in which her entire life could have been spent. Like many of Vance\u2019s peers, or my husband\u2019s, perhaps she simply doesn\u2019t know what she doesn\u2019t know\u200a\u2014\u200alike the folks who, when asking where my husband and I worked in California, stared blankly when we said \u201cStanford.\u201d I realize it\u2019s a highbrow academic\u2019s conceit to imagine everyone\u2019s heard of the big names in the university game, but in defense of my erstwhile self, until I lived here, it was typically the case\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, even in the remote Andes where my parents did their fieldwork (speaking of lives alien to those who, in their mid-forties, are grandparents several times over and have never been to an airport, let alone ridden a plane). But why does this digression matter? Simply put, because it\u2019s clear that Mrs. Keller has a somewhat sketchy relationship with facts. There\u2019s no fundamental reason why someone from a community facing economic and educational disadvantage shouldn\u2019t be capable of acquiring an education (indeed, see J.D. Vance and countless other Middletown natives who have left, most never to return) that prioritizes facts and thinking. But for myriad reasons, Middletown seems to fail on this front, and if you live in this general vicinity, as I have with my family for the past eleven years, you\u2019ve heard lots of talk about Middletown schools. Lots of it, and I\u2019d challenge you to find one piece of it that made you feel warm and fuzzy, no matter who you are or what your political bent. What shows me Mrs. Keller struggles to form a fact-based narrative to support? Simply put, it\u2019s her own statements about the platform she does support. For example, she\u2019s still putting forth the proven-false narrative of women\u2019s health clinics selling baby parts, and she has plainly dismissed credible scientific studies indicating that the most effective path to preventing abortions is to provide everyone in a community with fact-based sex education and access to contraception. But, like I say, I can understand how that happens to someone from Middletown. It\u2019s a tough community for someone to live in if they\u2019re not on the megachurch prosperity gospel keep-women-in-their-place train that is, realistically, probably the last remaining path to hope for some of Middletown\u2019s most tragically disenfranchised and disaffected. I\u2019m not without sympathy, compassion, and empathy for people in that position. Including Mrs. Keller, who I\u2019m sure holds her positions in the most heartfelt and sincere way possible. This whole story runs much deeper than just Mrs. Keller, though. Indeed, I might argue that Mrs. Keller is to be credited for her decision to run for office and put her principles into political action, even though it\u2019s clear that she and I would likely be hard-pressed to find any political common ground at all. But here\u2019s what gets me. Take a look at this excerpt from the Cincinnati Enquirer\u2019s voter guide for the 2016 general election, comparing the question and answers given by Mrs. Keller and her opponent, Democrat Suzi Rubin: http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/enquirer16/race-detail.do?id=14544132 Rubin, at right, responds to the question by stating what experience she brings to the table, in which arenas, how she acquired it and when, as well as how her work in those roles affected her sphere of influence, under what circumstances. By contrast, Mrs. Keller says: \u201cI am the only candidate in this race with a proven conservative track record. This district does not want an establishment go-along-to-get-along Representative. I will not be backed by people who are part of the problem. My opponent is backed by people who are part of the problem.\u201d So, let\u2019s say I\u2019m a conservative. No, seriously, there are plenty of times when I\u2019ve been called conservative\u200a\u2014\u200alike for my support of the Constitution and its applicability to unpopular people, for criticizing Obama on a variety of things ranging from economic policy to torture, for my support of the individual right to keep and bear arms, and for the many times I\u2019ve waded into the fray with my academic elite peers lambasting their failure to understand people from dramatically different backgrounds. Anyway, let\u2019s say I\u2019m a conservative. What does Mrs. Keller provide to me in her answer other than assertion that she has a proven track record as one? What does conservatism mean to her? I mean, what did Middletown schools tell her the word meant? And then again, even if they had told her it means \u201cfavoring the system and the status quo as they presently exist, expecting any change to the system to follow the system\u2019s rules for changing the status quo\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much of the world has defined it for some time\u200a\u2014\u200aMrs. Keller has spent her entire life existing in a culture which has told her that \u201cconservatism\u201d means Jesus, guns, and preventing fetal tissue from being legally extracted from the bodies of people who have concluded they cannot keep it there longer. I only know that, though, from following politics closely enough to have seen Mrs. Keller\u2019s name in the news and, following several occurrences of her name in the news clearly and provably attached to statements that made me gasp in shock, researched her published position statements, social media, and history as a candidate and officeholder. I should, at this point, mention that I have been told on no few occasions that people here think I spend a lot of time and energy on following news and current events and politics\u200a\u2014\u200alike, to the point where it looks like a hobby for me. I don\u2019t consider myself remarkably engaged in these pursuits; in a typical day throughout my life, I\u2019ve spent one to two hours per day consuming news and current events media and thinking about the topics, and I view that as a general baseline among many people of my acquaintance around the world and throughout my 45 years. I never cast a vote without having researched the candidate by at least reading the basic information published by a local newspaper, a local TV or radio station, and the League of Women Voters; I never fail to review my sample ballot prior to showing up to vote. And again, these are things I was taught to do\u200a\u2014\u200ain public school in New England, by my parents, and by the communities in which I lived. I mean, they didn\u2019t teach me how to plan a wedding, but they did teach me how to be a cog in the wheels of participatory democracy. But to someone who didn\u2019t grow up with that? To someone who thinks an hour or two a day is too long to spend, because nobody around them spends it, choosing instead to track a favorite pitcher\u2019s ERA or do their March Madness brackets, or to watch and read live tweets about Dancing With The Stars? To someone who knows \u201cconservative\u201d as a name for what they are, and assumes anyone else using it means the same thing, perhaps it\u2019s enough to hear someone say they identify the same way. That\u2019s the Tea Party gamble, writ large in the opening sentence of Mrs. Keller\u2019s answer to the question of what makes her the best candidate to represent her district in the statehouse: \u201cbecause I am what you call yourself.\u201d There\u2019s no content in her claim to conservatism. There\u2019s only a statement of identity. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. She continues, \u201cThis district does not want an establishment go-along-to-get-along Representative.\u201d As a general thing, that\u2019s\u2026 probably true, or at least resonant. It\u2019s also cleverly crafted to resonate, by setting up as a given that we\u2019re talking about \u201cthis district\u201d as a whole, and stating what that whole doesn\u2019t want, and then that there\u2019s an establishment, which plays go-along-to-get-along. So if we\u2019re going to fit in with this district (which isn\u2019t going along to get along in this case, I guess) we\u2019ll get in line against the establishment (I always think it\u2019s interesting when there\u2019s an authoritarian tone to an anti-establishment statement, but that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother kettle of fish). Anyway, that translates to: \u201cI will get up in your face with people who I deem establishment, or who I think are seeking compromise.\u201d So, if I have reason to believe Mrs. Keller means the same thing by \u201cconservative\u201d that I do, then I probably feel like this is a strong statement and means something. And if I don\u2019t really pay a lot of attention to news and politics and all that stuff, and this is all I see (in the local paper), I might relate to it. \u201cI will not be backed by people who are part of the problem.\u201d See, this is also clever. I mean, me with my fancy academic upbringing and all, I read this and the first thing I think is \u201cOkay, cool, so who are those people?\u201d and that\u2019s why I go looking, when I\u2019m reading my sample ballot and the thing in the paper, and all, before the election. But if I didn\u2019t do that homework? If instead, I just took it at face value and transferred it onto my own pre-existing perception of \u201cpeople who are part of the problem?\u201d Fuck yeah! They\u2019re not backing Mrs. Keller! I mean, whoever they are! That doesn\u2019t wash in an overeducated liberal elite household, believe me. BELIEVE ME. See, I\u2019m trying that style on for a second. Ahem. Seriously though, it won\u2019t play. All those snotty little smart kids destined for liberal arts colleges are getting up in their parents\u2019 faces about whether or not \u201csmart kids eat their vegetables\u201d is an a priori statement, and the parents are debating back while serving more organic sprout slaw and patting themselves (I\u2019d say ourselves, but I\u2019m pretty much the only sprout-slaw eater in my household) on the back for raising kids with a grasp of rhetoric. I\u2019ve no way of knowing what\u2019s going on in households like Mrs. Keller\u2019s, but based on meals I\u2019ve shared since moving here, saying \u201csomething like that discussion of rhetoric never seems to happen over ham salad and walking tacos\u201d is as a posteriori as noticing it\u2019s churchy as hell in Middletown. And Butler County at large. Just Middletown things But back to Mrs. Keller\u2019s cleverly crafted statement. My opponent is backed by people who are part of the\u00a0problem. I guess there\u2019s no nice way to say this. I can\u2019t entirely step away from the fact that I grew up around so many Christians, that I myself am the granddaughter of missionaries. But I would say to Mrs. Keller: I\u2019ve found a lot of things to think about in repeated readings of Matthew\u2019s take of Jesus\u2019 Sermon on the Mount. It starts in chapter 5 and runs through chapter 7, and this is stuff many of my Christian friends and I have found ourselves talking about lots over the years. I wouldn\u2019t presume to define how you relate to Jesus, but maybe this is a topic you could ask your pastor about. It\u2019s challenging, on so many levels, to contain the emotions raised by the kinds of statements Mrs. Keller seems to make routinely\u200a\u2014\u200aby her apparent lack of compassion for families and communities torn apart in her very district, by policies she supports and endorses. This is by no means typical of Butler County\u2019s Christian population, by the way\u200a\u2014\u200adiverse faith-based coalitions stand in direct opposition to Mrs. Keller\u2019s views, and are themselves bound to be her targets right along with the politicians who support efforts to aid refugees, undocumented residents or the region and their citizen families, and the area\u2019s most desperate poor in their quests to simply survive. And yet, as so many are eager to remind us all, we should remember all the people who don\u2019t have the educational privilege to know how to read a ballot, research a candidate, and determine what it is that candidate actually stands for. If, that is, they stand for anything at all. We should, some say, find empathy and compassion for people like the constituents who brought Mrs. Keller to her present role in Butler County\u200a\u2014\u200awhere she is one more elected official who clearly believes her role in government is not to represent the totality of her district, but rather, to represent the subset whose \u201cvote now\u201d buttons were pushed by the mere notion that she can claim a Christian conservative identity. Everyone else? You lost, get over it. You have no representation. That\u2019s the trend to which I wish to call attention: the \u201cYou lost, get over it\u201d trend, which may be the most succinct way to summarize the trending belief that a Representative\u2019s job is to serve the partisan interests of whatever radicalized fringe agenda is most shocking and immoderate among their voter base. Mrs. Keller, like many of her Tea Party compatriots seizing control of the Grand Old Party, crafted her statement with the backers she mentions\u200a\u2014\u200ato expect that old-school conservatives who read that, first and foremost, she\u2019s the conservative with a proven track record would vote for her on that basis despite her more extremist platform. But she and her backers also knew they could count on lots of other people who would read whatever they wanted to into \u201cconservative.\u201d Here\u2019s what Mrs. Keller understands: there are plenty of people for whom \u201cconservative\u201d is an identity, even though they don\u2019t have a clear sense of what it has historically meant from a policy perspective, or the background and education to understand it now, based on brief explanations. And lots and lots of them pay no attention to politics to speak of. That\u2019s a big chunk of her voter base. But the vocal ones? The people who\u2019ve literally been there for her all through her newly-launched career in politics? They\u2019re part of a culture we\u2019re spending a lot of time trying to either understand or manipulate (and that\u2019s a topic for another entire piece). We\u2019re talking about people who feel empowered and uplifted by words like her final statement on her comparison of Planned Parenthood to Nazis. She issued it to Local 12 News today: Just as the Nazis took the lives of millions of innocent people and sold their valuables for profit, Planned Parenthood has done likewise as we have seen in hidden camera videos. Planned Parenthood is a horrific industry that profits from the innocent and the American people should be appalled at their unconscionable activities. They deserve not one more penny of either federal or state\u00a0monies. Yep, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s her whole statement. She said that, and deleted her Facebook, in a classic rookie move that shows she doesn\u2019t think her positions stand up to scrutiny or challenge. Seriously, it\u2019s a rookie move so classic it\u2019s called the flounce, and it\u2019s been considered part of the basic \u201cthin-skinned Internet novice\u201d package for decades now. I think you can get bonus points for doing it as an elected official, with your flounce statement given to a local TV station, though. We\u2019d probably have to ask judges for a ruling. Now, she\u2019ll be back, and she\u2019ll likely cite \u201chaving been forced to delete her Facebook page\u201d and allege that people who left her comments like \u201cDid you seriously share that? What the hell!\u201d were harrassing her (NOTE: I didn\u2019t see any comments on her Facebook; she had deleted it already by the time I started writing this, and I considered it unsporting to retrieve it from an archive simply to demonstrate to an older person with weak Internet skills that you can\u2019t really ever get rid of anything online). And someone will bite. Someone\u2019s gonna see her claim, believe it wholesale, and start spreading the narrative that \u201cliberals forced her\u201d to delete her page and make the absurd statement she did. And that\u2019ll feed right into the formulaic Tea Party power-aggregation methodology that\u2019s easy to spot for anybody who does pay attention to news and politics and all that boring stuff, and apparently invisible to so many \u201cidentity conservatives,\u201d as I\u2019ve taken to calling them\u200a\u2014\u200aconservatives for whom being a conservative is more important than clearly articulating what that means. A side note: there are certainly \u201cidentity liberals\u201d as well, but that\u2019s not who represents Ohio\u2019s 53rd state congressional district, nor are they thick on the ground in southwestern Ohio. I already bought \u201cshe\u2019ll be back, and playing the victim\u201d in the office pool on this, by the way. You\u2019ll have to pick something else, or play Local Politics Bingo instead. Speaking of hobbies and pastimes. And before I wrap this up, let me just ask: were there really no more pressing issues your Butler County constituents need you to handle? No problem with the fire and EMS in Middletown, for instance? Nothing about that being even worse with the opioid epidemic? I mean, nobody\u2019s even got any problems with the roads? This was really, for sure, you\u2019re confident, the thing Butler County was counting you to do as a representative? But why does anyone outside of Butler County actually care about this? My point on this is made beautifully in Democracy Journal, winter 2014: \u201c Here is the key point: Even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority\u200a\u2014\u200aindeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center\u200a\u2014\u200athe entire gaggle of grassroots and elite organizations amounts to a pincers operation that wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates. Tea Party influence does not depend on general popularity at all.\u201d Well-qualified and experienced candidates, all over the USA and the world are losing to squads of people who, like Mrs. Keller, know that they can espouse positions someone else is likely to deem reprehensible, because locally, she enjoys sufficient support, and nobody not from her party can hope to exert any influence or engender any compassion and sway that. So this says to me: either we need to see Republicans take their party back\u200a\u2014\u200aa long shot at this point\u200a\u2014\u200aor we need to see Democrats who are ready, willing, and able to go toe to toe with people like Mrs. Keller in ways that are less easily dismissed as being like some liberal academic family discussing philosophy over dinner. I\u2019m not sure how that looks, but eleven years of living here have convinced me that it looks nothing like the reasoned discourse of the academic world that spawned the likes of me. If Mrs. Keller\u2019s win is any indication, it looks like bullying social behaviour that results in a Republican women\u2019s group meeting on a rented bus in a parking lot to avoid other members of the group. And it\u2019s a hard thing, because there\u2019s not a lot of common ground between someone like me and someone like Mrs. Keller or her ardent supporters. A penultimate point: I said that Mrs. Keller is to be commended for becoming involved in politics, and I sincerely believe that. It\u2019s what any individual should eventually consider if possessed of strong beliefs about government. That doesn\u2019t mean I agree with her, support any of the same positions, think she\u2019s good at her job, or think she deserves her job. But that\u2019s moot; she\u2019s not my representative (mine\u2019s the somewhat more sedate Paul Zeltwanger, who seems to have spent most of his time in office so far sponsoring legislation to honor fellow legislators in Columbus). But before considering running for office, before signing up to go to protests, before anything else, I would urge every single person who thinks they may ever be eligible to vote in the USA to institute the simple practices I use before voting: Oh, and just one last thing, and then I\u2019ll see myself out. Mrs. Keller, I suspect that not only will history not, in fact, view the logo of a women\u2019s health clinic where a small percentage of procedures performed are a legal medical procedure you clearly don\u2019t understand as being like the banner under which Hitler carried out the vast range of atrocities perpetrated by his regime, and not only is that comparison absurd, but I wonder: how will history remember Candice Keller? I can\u2019t help but wonder if it will be like the low-level Nazi officials who believed abortion should not be legal, or more like those who believed in rounding up parents and children and making them disappear. Which is to say, it remembers them so little that it would, indeed, be a hobby to research them sufficiently to find the name of one just like you. Thanks for reading!
