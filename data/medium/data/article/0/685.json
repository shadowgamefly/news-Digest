Simple enough, right? Communication in its simplest\u00a0form. If it is so simple, then why is it so hard for companies to communicate to their audience? There seems to be an unspoken epidemic among startups of being unable to communicate with their audiences. I have seen the disconnect first hand, and the problems a lack of proper communication leads to. If communication is so simple, why is it hard for companies to communicate to their audience?
