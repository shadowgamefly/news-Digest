I also get a lot of asks for intros. A lot of intros. I don\u2019t throw these numbers out to show how popular I am.

EMAIL 1. @yourdomain.com This sounds obvious, but always send from your company domain (e.g. @thestorefront.com). I always work with a few startups every accelerator program that use their personal email. It makes it look like you aren\u2019t focused on your business, or are too lazy to set up a business email account. Google Apps, use it! 2. Email signature Have a catchy email signature. Everyone sees it. Also, for incoming emails and the ability to quickly identify the emailer on LinkedIn use the Rapportive Chrome extension for Gmail. BONUS: Add a tracked link and record how many site visits your footer brings. EXTRA BONUS: Consider adding a promo code and tracking that. There\u2019s value to capture in your email signature, so play around and see what you can come up with. Example: The above signature made with\u00a0SignBot. 3. #ABC\u200a\u2014\u200aAlways Be\u00a0Closing Every email, conversation, or message of any kind is an opportunity to sell your company\u200a\u2014\u200asubtle or not. Give people a link back to your company in both your signature and email address every single time. 4. Geographic abbreviations A quick point on geographic abbreviations: SF = San Francisco MV = Mountain View PA = Palo Alto Sand Hill Road = Investor Central Avenue INTROS 5. BCC and thank your connection Always BCC and thank the intro person after accepting the email. Example: \u2018Thanks Tristan > bcc.\u2019 at the top of the email body. 6. Response\u00a0time Respond quickly (24 hours or less). The faster the better. It shows you are on top of your game, and that you care. 7. Personal, not\u00a0pushy Don\u2019t ask for intros in an initial email to a founder; ask after the second or third conversation. Really get to know other founders and investors and understand their unique personality. SF is the place to be for unique personalities. Overall, relationships rule, and talking to someone in person is always the most memorable. A tip on finding your strongest intro to someone beyond LinkedIn or AngelList: Conspire.com. 8. The 15-minute call I often suggest a quick 15-minute call to talk about X, Y, Z specific points in order to not waste someone\u2019s time that doesn\u2019t know me yet. 9. Follow-ups If you took an intro, let the intro-maker know how it went. I always appreciate a follow-up, thank you, and to know it actually helped to make the intro. Brent Locks, the founder of Pict, once broke down the components of a good, forwardable investor intro email for me: > Quick one-liner saying what\u2019s up to me. > Who you want an intro to. What you guys are doing. How/why what you\u2019re doing means you must meet X investor (i.e. how you guys would benefit). It\u2019s why you must meet them and why they must meet you. It\u2019s a two way street. It\u2019s a partnership. It\u2019s not only why you would benefit (you\u2019re gonna get money, duh!). > Traction (talk it up). \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re killing it, we\u2019re crushing it, we\u2019re squishing it, etc.\u201d Using the words \u201ckilling it\u201d or \u201ccrushing it\u201d will almost certainly land your email in the trash. Do NOT use those words. Traction should be quantifiable. > Add your Angel.co link. > Attach an overview deck or one-pager. Many legit investors won\u2019t do a meeting without seeing something in advance.* > Make sure to be genuine. While this is the template, these emails aren\u2019t mad libs. For me, Brent\u2019s second to last point is debatable, I think you should have a pitch deck and shorter email-ready deck or one-pager ready, but there also should be some reciprocity or interest on the investors part before divulging a full deck or company numbers. Dave McClure also\u00a0adds: I always like three bullets of milestones, as well as a link to the company\u2019s AngelList profile, both in footer and body of the\u00a0email. \u2013 MRR / ARR is\u00a0$X. \u2013 Growth is Y% average over the past 3\u20136\u00a0months. \u2013 Raised $Z from notable investors A, B,\u00a0C. Here\u2019s an example (with names and numbers changed) from Varun Khona of HeadOut\u200a\u2014\u200amy mentee in Batch 11 of the 500 Startups accelerator. SUBJECT LINE: Intro to [Investor] at [Fund Name] BODY: Hey Tristan, I would like to get in touch with [Investor Name] from [Fund Name]. They have a very strong portfolio of on-demand mobile services such as Lyft, Uber and Washio and would be a great strategic fit with Headout. Below is a quick blurb you can forward. Headout is a mobile marketplace for spontaneous travelers to discover & book local activities on-demand for the next 24 hours. Think of it as the HotelTonight for tours & experiences. Traction: \u2013 $XM sales run-rate in 6 months \u2013 Growing X% month-over-month \u2013 Average transaction size is $X We are raising our seed round and would love to talk. You can download the app here: https://www.headout.com/app\u200a\u2014\u200aor visit our AngelList Profile. Thanks, Varun I call this a \u2018forwardable intro\u2019 email and, if I\u2019m excited about the product, founder, and industry, as I am with Varun and HeadOut, I would forward this email to the respective investor and tell them why I\u2019m excited. In closing, these tips are obviously only a snapshot of how Silicon Valley (and San Francisco) communicate, but keeping these points in mind when talking with founders, investors, journalists, and others in the tech scene is incredibly important to growing your network and being respected. Overall, #ABT, too: ALWAYS BE THOUGHTFUL. It\u2019s hugely respected by founders and investors. Till next time, stay nice and KEEP HUSTLING. ", "name": "165", "child": "165_1", "timestamp": "Apr 14"}
