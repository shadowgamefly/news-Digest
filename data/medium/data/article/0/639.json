Since you sell great products, many of your visitors will add an item to the shopping cart. However, about 65% of these shoppers will not purchase the item or items that they have added to their cart. This leaves a big discrepancy between your \u201cadded to cart\u201d and \u201cpurchased\u201d rates. In an effort to increase the conversions of website visitors into customers, MailChimp lets you send a custom, automated email to visitors that have added an item to the shopping cart (Shopify also has this functionality built-in, but it\u2019s only available on some of their more expensive paid tiers). This allows you to encourage customers to complete their purchase by offering a discount, free shipping, or bonus gift."}, {"6ab5": "Customer Re-engagement Email"}, {"6a58": "If a customer buys a product from your store (which of course sells great products with unsurpassed customer service), it is likely that they will buy again. MailChimp\u2019s customer re-engagement email automation allows you to set up triggers that send emails to customers who have purchased an item from your store in the past. The standard setup involves sending three different emails. These emails are triggered 30, 60, and 90 days after the customer\u2019s last purchase. I like to use this standard setup because it allows me to test different subject lines, copy, and offers, without spamming the customer\u2019s inbox. You can always change the triggers to send these emails more frequently, but do so with caution. If you\u2019re sending re-engagement, abandoned cart, newsletters, and the latest sales updates to your customers they may feel overwhelmed and unsubscribe."}, {"76df": "Image from MailChimp"}, {"8a42": "The re-engagement email is more than just a chance to get more sales. It\u2019s a chance to nurture relationships with your existing customers. Subject lines like \u201cWe miss you\u201d or \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in a while\u2026\u201d have better open rates as they reference an existing relationship and seem less spammy. Personalizing subject lines with the customer\u2019s first name also helps to further make that connection of an existing relationship."}, {"07e4": "Sometimes a great subject line and copy isn\u2019t enough to get conversions. Delivering value in these emails is the best way to develop the customer relationship and drive purchases. One of the simplest ways to do this is through discounts or free shipping, which are aimed at increasing purchases at that exact moment. Other forms of value could focus on education and building a long-term relationship with the customer. Sharing articles or blog posts that your customers care about will help them to learn more about your product and industry, and will make you a trusted source of information. For example, if you sell laptop cases, your customers may enjoy a \u201chow-to\u201d article about laptop care.
