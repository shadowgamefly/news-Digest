CREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite For the second day in a row, all Democratic lawmakers on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted a vote to send President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial pick for EPA administrator, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to the Senate floor for a full confirmation vote. This time, Republicans did it without them, with Committee Chairman Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) suspending committee rules that require at least one Democrat to be present for a panel vote to send a nomination through to the Senate floor. Pruitt was then voted through committee by a vote of 11\u20130. \u201cYesterday the minority members of the committee chose to boycott this meeting,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cIt is disappointing that they chose that method, but we will not allow it to obstruct.\u201d Trump to tap vocal EPA opponent to head the EPARIP, EPA.thinkprogress.org Barrasso argued that Pruitt had \u201csat through the longest EPA nomination hearing in history and answered the most questions.\u201d He also argued that it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d for a minority to boycott for an incoming president\u2019s EPA nominee. After President Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted a confirmation meeting for then-EPA administrator nominee Gina McCarthy, arguing that McCarthy had failed to adequately answer the more than 1,000 questions Republican senators submitted in writing. Obama nominated McCarthy in March of 2013; she wasn\u2019t confirmed as EPA administrator until July of that year. Democrats used a similar line of reasoning in defending their boycott of Pruitt, arguing that Pruitt had failed to adequately answer questions both during the confirmation hearing and submitted later in writing. \u201cEPA nominee Scott Pruitt failed to answer important questions about his ties to industry,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIf he cannot answer the multitude of questions we\u2019ve asked about his record and views, neither we nor the American people can have confidence that Pruitt is working to keep air and water clean, rather than protecting the profits of polluters.\u201d Barrasso called the move \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d \u201cThe nation needs a new EPA administrator,\u201d Barrasso said. Scott Pruitt\u2019s record reveals a long history of industry favoritismAs Oklahoma\u2019s Attorney General, Pruitt has a history of slowing environmental regulation, cutting enforcement, and\u2026thinkprogress.org Pruitt\u2019s nomination will now go to the full Senate for confirmation.

Joe Manchin (D-WV), has indicted that he will vote to confirm Pruitt. Environmental groups immediately voiced their concern over the vote to move Pruitt through committee, citing his history of suing the EPA, his ties to the fossil fuel industry, and his climate denial. \u201cThe Trump administration has let the fossil fuel industry hijack the EPA in broad daylight,\u201d 350.org Executive Director Mary Boeve said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable but not surprising that members of Trump\u2019s party want a climate denier running the EPA.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, employed an similar tactic to send the nominations of Steve Mnuchin, nominated for Treasury Secretary, and Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), nominated for Secretary of Health and Human Services, through to the Senate floor despite a Democratic boycott of the vote.
