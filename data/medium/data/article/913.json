Just like in 2016, I\u2019ve combed through these results and summarized them for you. Here\u2019s a lightning-fast snapshot of what the software development profession looks like in 2017. A vast majority of developers consider themselves \u201cweb developers.\u201d Most web developers consider themselves \u201cfull stack developers.\u201d JavaScript is by far the most popular tool programmers use\u00a0today. Developers work in a wide variety of industries\u200a\u2014\u200amost of them outside of what we traditionally call\u00a0\u201ctech.\u201d Most of them work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. But less than 1 in 5 of them work at a\u00a0startup. Most of them work as full-time employees. Two-thirds of them got their current job through someone they already knew, or were approached by a recruiter. Regardless of their specialization, developers make good\u00a0money. And if they happen to be in America, they make even more\u00a0money. This said, most of them feel underpaid for the caliber of work they\u00a0do. Two out of three developers work from home at least a few days a\u00a0month. And they prefer to listen to music while they\u00a0work. 30% of all developers have been coding for less than 5\u00a0years. Most developers went to college, but nearly a quarter of working developers never finished a 4-year\u00a0degree. 80% of college-educated developers studied some kind of technology-related major. Despite this, less than half of developers consider their formal education to be \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to their\u00a0jobs. Even though software development is dominated by men, it\u2019s becoming more diverse. Just one year ago, 93% of respondents were male. This time, only 89%\u00a0were. 1 in 100 developers are blind, and 1 in 200 developers are\u00a0deaf. freeCodeCamp contributor Florian Beijers was born blind. You can read how he\u2019s able to program using a standard-issue laptop. Thanks for reading.
