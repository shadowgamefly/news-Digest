{"name": "296", "parent": "", "content": "Peter Drucker: How to (Actually) Manage Your\u00a0Time Many consider Peter Drucker the most influential thinker in the history of management. His prolific writings\u200a\u2014\u200aover 30 books\u200a\u2014\u200ahave gone on to sell millions of copies and inspire young managers all over the world. That\u2019s great. But what if you\u2019re not a manager? What if you\u2019re a freelancer, an office grunt, or just a hermit living in the woods? Can Drucker still help you? You bet. There\u2019s one thing that everyone has to manage. It\u2019s something very close to us\u200a\u2014\u200aourselves. For Drucker, this self-management starts with time. In The Essential Drucker\u200a\u2014\u200aan excellent intro to Drucker\u2019s prolific writings (over 30 books!)\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s an entire chapter devoted to his method of time management. I\u2019ve used a variant Drucker\u2019s method on and off for a while now. When I do use it, I am a productive beast, averaging 7\u20138 hours of quality work a day. When I don\u2019t, I average 2\u20133 hours\u200a\u2014\u200ano better than the average American. Let\u2019s take a look at Drucker\u2019s method. Why Time? I have a friend who never runs out of startup ideas. Every few weeks, he sends me an excited message that goes something like this: HEYYYY MANNN! I\u2019ve got this AWESOME idea. Nobody\u2019s thought of it. There\u2019s an inefficiency in the market. All I have to do is exploit it, and BAM!!!!11!!! It\u2019s gonna be the next Facebook!\u201d Five years later, there\u2019s still only one Facebook. My friend is still teaching English. What\u2019s wrong here? Well, a lot is wrong. But, according to Drucker, the most obvious mistake is that he is starting in the wrong place: \u201cEffective knowledge workers, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They start with their time.\u201d I see this often. People make intricate plans for diets, businesses, or world travel and, well, none of it happens. It\u2019s a pleasant fantasy. If you want results instead of fantasies, the first step is to start executing. And execution starts by mastering your time. The Three Steps to Master Your\u00a0Time Drucker\u2019s method can be roughly divided into three steps. The first step is to understand. 1. Record Your\u00a0Time If you\u2019re like me, you probably read \u201crecord your time\u201d and thought something like this: Pshhhh. Are you kidding? I\u2019m me. ME. I lived it, so I know where my time goes. Why bother to track it? Nope. Our minds are fickle, says Drucker: \u201cMan is ill-equipped to manage his time. Even in total darkness, most people retain their sense of space. But even with the lights on, a few hours in a sealed room render most people incapable of estimating how much time has elapsed. [\u2026] If we rely on our memory, therefore, we do not know how time has been spent.\u201d The only way to stay honest is to track in the moment. There are countless ways to do this: \u201cThe specific method in which the record is put together need not concern us here.\u00a0\u2026 The important thing is that it gets done, and that the record is made in \u201creal\u201d time\u2026\u201c It doesn\u2019t matter how you do it. Just make sure that you do. Here are some ways you can try: Personally, I track on paper and record everything to a spreadsheet at the end of the day. Drucker recommends doing this for 3\u20134 weeks. I think 1 is probably enough, for starters. Either way, take your records and\u2026 2. Diagnose Your\u00a0Time The next step is to analyze your records. Nobody spends their time perfectly, says Drucker: \u201cI have yet to see a knowledge worker, regardless of rank or station, who could not consign something like a quarter of the demands on his time to the wastepaper basket without anybody\u2019s noticing their disappearance.\u201d I find that, without time-tracking, more than half of my time goes towards \u201cuseless\u201d activities. (Note that is work time. Whether or not to track your social life is a topic for another time.) The goal during this step is to figure out where time is being wasted. To help figure it out, Drucker gives two questions we can ask. Question One: \u201cWhat would happen if this were not done at all?\u201d \u201c[Ask:] What would happen if this were not done at all? And if the answer is, Nothing would happen, then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.\u201d This is pretty straightforward. If you think something might be useless, take it out and see what happens. Question Two: \u201cWhat activities could someone else do better?\u201d I get stuck here a lot. I tend to think I can do things better than anybody else. Even if that\u2019s true (it\u2019s not), that\u2019s not the point. The point is that I do some things better than other things. It makes sense to delegate, outsource, automate things that I am less good at so I can do more of what I excel at. Some things you can try: 3. Consolidate Your\u00a0Time Step two was about finding wasted time and eliminating it. But there\u2019s another way to manage your time: you can reorganize it. A one-hour block is not the same as ten six-minute blocks. High-level creative work needs around two hours of focus. If you\u2019re always interrupted by meetings (or kids), no real work will happen. Drucker recommends that we \u201cblock off\u201d at least a quarter of our day to do private, focused work: \u201cEven one-quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done.\u201d If your work is highly creative (writing, etc.), you might need to block off a lot more. One Last\u00a0Thing Try doing the above three things for a few weeks. I\u2019ve seen impressive results from it. But there\u2019s a caveat. This is not one of the things that you just do once in a lifetime. Without periodic attention, we \u201cdecay\u201d to our old selves, says Drucker: \u201c\u2026effective executives have the log run on themselves for three to four weeks at a stretch twice a year or so, on a regular schedule.\u201d And, when you\u2019ve made the time, consider checking out The Essential Drucker.
