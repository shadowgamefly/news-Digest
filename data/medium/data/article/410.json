Coders love to argue about this kind of stuff. The tabs vs. spaces debate even made it into a famous episode of the HBO show Silicon Valley. Well in this article, I will finally give you the definitive answers you seek. Early in my career, I engaged in all kinds of holy wars. I would read some article about why a particular convention was correct, while another was totally wrong. I would get right up there on my high and mighty horse and proclaim to anyone who would listen that they were wrong and I was right. It took me years to find the right answers but I\u2019ve finally done it and it turns out the answer is\u2026 These things don\u2019t matter. Consistency matters. Readability matters. Arguing and stressing about one convention over another matters not. Over the past 20+ years, I\u2019ve followed every imaginable trend. I\u2019ve followed the different conventions of different languages. None of it has impacted my bug count or made my code any more efficient. This is just sillyness. Still funny\u00a0though. Don\u2019t get me wrong, clean-looking, well-formatted code will be easier to change and maintain over time, and that\u2019s a good thing. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with wanting your code to look beautiful. But too often, this is used to justify what essentially boils down to procrastination. We procrastinate like this because coding is hard. Things can get complicated in a hurry and we\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially those of us who may be new to this level of complexity\u200a\u2014\u200acan become intimidated by this complexity and grow insecure about our ability to tame it. It\u2019s much safer to argue over trivial things. Our perceived incompetence is less likely to be exposed that way. The phenomena of debating trivialities to avoid hard problems is so common that there are a number of popular theories that describe it. One of the most popular is Parkinson\u2019s Law of Triviality which states that members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. In illustrating this law, Parkinson used the fictional example of a committee whose job it was to approve plans for a new nuclear plant, but who spent the majority of their time arguing over what materials to use for the staff bike shed. They neglected the proposed design of the plant itself, which was a far more important but also far more complex issue. Because of the reference to a bike shed in this canonical example, Danish developer, Poul-Henning Kamp later coined the term \u201cbike shed effect\u201d or simply \u201cbike shedding\u201d to describe it. If you work in software development\u200a\u2014\u200aand especially if you hang out with other coders on social media\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re likely to come across some form of bike-shedding almost daily. Say what you will, but I think grey is a lovely color for a bike\u00a0shed. If you find yourself getting into an unusually heated debate with your fellow coders, online or in-person, it\u2019s probably also worth remembering Sayre\u2019s Law\u2026 \u201cIn any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at\u00a0stake.\u201d As a consultant, I bounce from client to client, and each one has their own rules and conventions. I decided long ago that the only way for me to succeed was to let go of the trivialities and focus on the hard problems. When it comes to coding standards, I take what I get and I don\u2019t get upset. If you happen to find yourself in a position to pick your own style guide, I recommend that you ask yourself these two simple questions: If you can answer \u201cyes\u201d to both of those questions, then you\u2019re good to go. Simple as that.
