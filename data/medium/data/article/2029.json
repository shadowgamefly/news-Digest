Creatives are fucked. And it may be too\u00a0late. The best part of doing creative work online for people is when they email you to say \u201cyou used to be good but now you\u2019re a loser.\u201d Or another of my favourites this week, \u201cFuck off you marketing scum.\u201d Or \u201cwebsites aren\u2019t real businesses. Go build software asshole.\u201d All of these for people who are consuming work that you\u2019ve done for free. But hey, at least you get offered speaking and performing and writing and creative gigs! \u2026until you tell them you want them to pay for your expenses or even a fee. Then they disappear pretty damn fast. Which is your own fault for violating the golden rule\u200a\u2014\u200abloggers and writers must never try to get paid. Once you try and get paid everyone thinks you\u2019ve sold out. And they send you lovely messages yelling at you for it. How dare you! And when they read your free content they think they\u2019re doing you a favour. And tell you that, too. \u201cI gave you 5 minutes of my time reading your shit, so you owe me one.\u201d I love publishing. But it\u2019s a tough racket. And there\u2019s a lot of crap you have to be able to handle from a lot of people. With not a whole lot back. It\u2019s the same for almost any other creative industry. It\u2019s also becoming increasingly difficult to look at publishing online or being an artist or recording music or starting a publication as a full time career. If you do want to get into creative work, you\u2019re going to have to see it as a side hustle. Not your main gig. That\u2019s just the way it is. It could become your main gig\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019re very, very lucky\u200a\u2014\u200abut the chances are slim. It\u2019s hard to make it work. But that\u2019s the case for most content creators. Film makers. Artists. Writers. Musicians. We\u2019ve made it easier than ever to make stuff, and harder than ever to make enough money to live. And every day, there\u2019s a new \u201cdisruptive\u201d startup that does more damage. What they \u201cdisrupt\u201d is creator\u2019s profits, most of the time. That\u2019s what music streaming did. And so now we look at creative work as something that should be free, or close to it. Hey, stuff on YouTube & Medium is \u201cfree\u201d so why pay? For example: I started using micropayments recently to charge 10 cents for some articles on the Creatomic Wordpress. I got 5 emails calling me out for caring about money. People thought I was a sell out for charging $0.10 for articles nobody was forcing them to read. People don\u2019t want to pay for content. They want to consume it for free, or monetise it for themselves. There\u2019s never been a greater sense of people feeling entitled to your creative work than there is right now. And in that entitlement, respect for creative work is vanishing. If you tell people you\u2019re an artist, they\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not much of a career path and you should get a real job. If you tell people you\u2019re building a tech startup platform for artists, they\u2019ll be impressed and want to hear more. Sure, there\u2019s some good people out there. The folks who built Patreon for writers and artists. Bandcamp for musicians. But how many people actually pay using those platforms? Certainly, they\u2019re not the average punter. Or, put it this way. How many people could tell you how much money they\u2019ve given to their favourite artists or writers or creators? Not to platforms, not to businesses, to actual creatives? To put it on a macro scale. Nicki Minaj, for example, has 77,000,000 Instagram followers consuming her free social content. 77,000,000 followers, and her last album sold 800,000\u00a0copies. That means that barely 1% of her followers actually purchased an album. The rest? Streaming it, YouTubing it, just following without buying. If a mega star like Nicki Minaj has a conversion rate that low for actual sales, what does that mean for indie creators? Some folks are going to point out that people don\u2019t buy albums anymore, they stream them. Sure. In 2015, Drake made $15,000,000 from Spotify streaming. Nice cash right? Yes, but it took close to 2 billion streams to make that. I\u2019m not saying you have to feel sorry for Nicki Minaj and Drake. I\u2019m just saying that once you reduce those numbers down to the indie level, how do you think they look? Hint\u200a\u2014\u200anowhere near as healthy. Maybe $0.00084 a stream. And let me tell you, people spend a lot less on writing than they do on music. How does a writer live, on the money we\u2019re talking right now? To bring this thread back home, we\u2019re basically abolishing the full time musician/writer/filmmaker. We\u2019re abolishing the full time creative. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re giving money to tech platforms to become \u201cUnicorns\u201d off the backs of creatives, and driving creatives out of business. If you grew up dreaming of being an artist, a writer, a musician, honing your craft, putting in your \u201c10,000\u201d hours, you may not even have the necessary skills to get a full time job to support your creative work. So what happens then? I don\u2019t have any answers right now. But I will say this. I write because I\u2019m passionate about it, and I love it. It\u2019s not going away. I could have a readership of zero and I\u2019d still be here. However, I also don\u2019t see it as a full time gig. It\u2019s something I do for the sake of doing it, because I want to do it. And that\u2019s what creative work is becoming. The thing is, it\u2019s hard to do great creative work at the end of the day when you\u2019re tired and worn down by trying to make a living in a day job, in a business that you\u2019ve founded to bring in income etc. And then when you do get to create something, and you put it out for the world to see, if it\u2019s free you\u2019ll get a bunch of people who hate it, and if it\u2019s not you\u2019ll be called money hungry. We\u2019ve screwed creative people over. We started doing that years ago, and I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s now too late to change it. So the next time someone tells me about their disruptive music startup or publishing startup or filmmaking platform, you\u2019ll forgive me if I look like I\u2019m going to punch their teeth down their throat.
