{"name": "823", "parent": "", "content": "Reading Is For Geeks? Wrong, It\u2019s for Achievers. 7 Reasons why Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and co. spend hours every day\u00a0reading\u2026 If I could go back in time and give one piece of advice to my younger self, it would be this: Read.A.Lot. Reserve 2\u20133 hours of your day just for reading. Read (auto-)biographies of great men. Read books. Read magazines. Read scientific papers. Read online articles. Read on your smartphone. Read whenever you\u2019ve got some spare time on your hands and don\u2019t know what to do with it. I currently work part-time in a construction working site. I start work at 7:30am in the morning. I leave the house at 6:45am. When do I get up? Not after 5am. Why? So that I can spend some of my sharpest hours in the day reading\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s how important it is to me. Most days I guess I read for about 3 hours. Some days it\u2019s 5 hours. Some days it\u2019s 10 minutes. But it rarely happens that a day passes by and I didn\u2019t read at least a couple of paragraphs. You can tell: I am 100% sold on the benefits of reading. Now let me convince YOU. Here are 7 reasons why reading is one of the best things you could ever do. Let\u2019s get to it\u2026 (BY THE WAY: When I talk about reading I don\u2019t talk about the geeky \u201cit\u2019s such a fun activity\u201d type of reading. There\u2019s a shitload of activities that are a LOT more fun. I\u2019m talking about reading to gain knowledge and get access to ideas and insights of great men and women\u2026 I talk about reading as a personal growth tool, not a means to get pleasure or have fun.) #1 Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, Charlie Munger, Oprah, Elon Musk, and Co. ALL Read A\u00a0Lot These 3 billionaires? All voracious readers\u2026 The more I read and learn, the more I realize how little I know about myself and the world\u2026 \u2026yet, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m getting more and more convinced of: Truly great and \u201csuccessful\u201d (whatever the fuck that means) people are voracious readers. Just check out some of these examples\u2026 Take Warren Buffet as an example\u200a\u2014\u200amulti-billionaire and currently the 3rd richest person in the world. When asked to describe his day, he said, \u201cI just sit in my office and read all day.\u201d He estimates that he spends 80 percent of his working day reading and thinking. Also, when asked about the key to success, Buffett pointed to a stack of nearby books and said, \u201cRead 500 pages like this every day. That\u2019s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.\u201d His infamous business partner, Charlie Munger, is famous for saying, \u201cGo to bed smarter than you woke up.\u201d About his partnership with Warren Buffet, he comments, \u201cYou could hardly find a partnership in which two people settle on reading more hours of the day than in ours.\u201d Damn, these guys are committed to reading\u2026 Next up, Oprah Winfrey\u200a\u2014\u200aself-made multi-billionaire, currently the world\u2019s 21th most powerful woman, and the only person in the world to have appeared in Time\u2019s list of the most influential people 10 times. She supposedly started reading as a toddler and never stopped. She once mentioned, \u201cBooks were my pass to personal freedom. I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi.\u201d You may also have heard about her book club where she selects one of her favorite books every month. Speaking of book clubs, Bill Gates does a similar thing and shares his reading list online. He reads more than 50 books a year and credits his success at least partly to books: \u201cI really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot.\u201d Mark Cuban, another self-made billionaire, writes on his blog that he reads 3+ hours a day, \u201cMost people won\u2019t put in the time to get a knowledge advantage. Sure, there were folks that worked hard at picking up every bit of information that they could, but we were few and far between. To this day, I feel like if I put in enough time consuming all the information available, particularly with the net making it so readily available, I can get an advantage in any technology business. Of course my wife hates that I read more than 3 hours almost every day, but it gives me a level of comfort and confidence in my businesses. AT MicroSolutions it gave me a huge advantage. A guy with little computer background could compete with far more experienced guys just because I put in the time to learn all I could.\u201d Elon Musk, when asked how he learned to build rockets, answers \u201cI read books.\u201d Last but not least, Mark Zuckerberg. He resolved to read a book every two weeks in 2015, and even started a book club called \u201cA Year of Books\u201d in order to discuss those books with the Facebook community. These guys are committed to learning\u200a\u2014\u200aand reading is a key part of their learning machinery. Bottom line: Many of the most accomplished people in the world use reading as a key practice to stay on top of their game and get what Mark Cuban calls \u201cthe knowledge advantage\u201d. #2 Reading Gives You Tools to Solve Your\u00a0Problems Modern life is full of \u201cproblems\u201d. Maybe you have trouble falling asleep at night. Or you are going through a depression. Or your marriage sucks. Or you\u2019re suffering from low self-esteem. Or you\u2019re going through a tough break-up. Or maybe you\u2019re overweight. Or you\u2019re underweight. Wouldn\u2019t life be better if you got rid of some of your problems? FACT: You would be a lot better off if you could get rid of some of your problems. You would also be able to achieve more in life. The PROBLEM is: You don\u2019t know how to solve most of your problems. Why? Because you lack the right tools, the right knowledge and know-how. And this is where books come in\u200a\u2014\u200athey give you the necessary tools and knowledge to solve almost any problem. Let me give you an example from my own life: How reading helped me cure my insomnia for good: I\u2019ve been suffering from insomnia until about a year ago. I wasn\u2019t a chronic insomniac, but there were a lot of nights of just lying in bed for hours and hours and not being able to fall asleep\u200a\u2014\u200amy overactive mind wouldn\u2019t let me. Then I started reading lots of articles about curing insomnia and sleep optimization in general. I learned everything I could about the causes of insomnia and how to fall asleep faster. I started using the tricks, started seeing some results, and just kept on tweaking and tweaking. Today, I can fall asleep on demand, every night, within 5\u201310 minutes. Reading gave me the tools to solve this problem. And it\u2019s been well worth it. My health is better. I\u2019m feeling less stressed. I can easily get adequate amounts of sleep. I can get up early when I want to. I save a lot of time and energy. Frankly, getting rid of this problem was a big upgrade for me. (Note: You find a lot of the tools Jonas and I use to fall asleep faster on this very blog. You can get access to these tools through\u2026 *drumroll* reading.) The point is, (almost) every problem you\u2019re currently struggling with can be solved by reading the right book(s). The more you read, the more tools you\u2019ll have in your tool belt. The more tools you have, the more problems can be solved and the stronger you\u2019ll become as a person. Bottom line: Reading helps you solve problems. For any problem you currently have in life there are at least 100+ books showing you ways to solve it. #3 Reading Gives You the Tools to Reach Your\u00a0Goals Same story. Just like there are tools to solve your problems, there are also tools that will help you reach your goals, dreams, and ambitions for the future. There are more than enough books teaching you exactly how to achieve all those things and more. Bottom line: Books give you all the tools, knowledge, and know-how you need to achieve your goals and aspiration for the future. #4 Reading Powerfully Changes Your Mindsets and\u00a0Beliefs Every heard of a mindset intervention? Here\u2019s Kelly McGonigal\u2019s explanation from The Upside of Stress: \u201cMindsets are beliefs that shape your reality, including objective physical reactions (like the strength of my arm as Crum pushed on it), and even long-term health, happiness, and success. More important, the new field of mindset science shows that a single brief intervention, designed to change how you think about something, can improve your health, happiness, and success, even years into the future. The field is full or remarkable findings that will make you think twice about your own beliefs. From placebos to self-fulfilling prophecies, perception matters.\u201d The goal of a mindset intervention is to change your mindset about something\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, how you think or feel about something. This then can lead to remarkable changes in a person\u2019s health, happiness, and success. Here\u2019s an interesting study highlighting the powerful effects such a mindset intervention can have: \u200bIn a study testing whether the relationship between exercise and health is moderated by one\u2019s mind-set, 84 female room attendants working in seven different hotels were measured on physiological health variables affected by exercise. Those in the informed condition were told that the work they do (cleaning hotel rooms) is good exercise and satisfies the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendations for an active lifestyle. Examples of how their work was exercise were provided. Subjects in the control group were not given this information. Although actual behavior did not change, 4 weeks after the intervention, the informed group perceived themselves to be getting significantly more exercise than before. As a result, compared with the control group, they showed a decrease in weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index. That\u2019s how powerful our mindsets and beliefs are. Remember, these housekeepers didn\u2019t consciously change a thing. All that really changed was their mindset\u2026 and just look what a crazy effect it had on their lives. Now think about it in your own life. What beliefs and mindsets might you be having that are potentially holding you back? Maybe you believe that life is tough, that women don\u2019t like skinny guys (or fat guys), that achieving anything in this life without a college degree is impossible. Maybe you believe that losing weight is hard, or that building muscle mass is impossible, or that eating healthy is expensive, or\u00a0\u2026 These are all mindsets and beliefs that society has conditioned and programmed into your (subconscious) mind. These programs\u200a\u2014\u200athat you did not choose yourself\u200a\u2014\u200aare now running your life without you even knowing it. Here\u2019s where books come into play: Reading books gives you more programs to choose from. They give you alternative views. They give you other perspectives. They show you that your narrow view of the world may not be the end-all-be-all. Books are nothing more than mindset interventions. And best of all, one book may contain 5, 10, 20, or even more mindset interventions. They can completely change your life by changing your beliefs, your mindsets, your entire worldview and how you see the world. Are you starting to understand how reading can be a true game-changer? How reading turns you into a fuller and more powerful human being? How reading can completely turn your life around? How it can literally create a new, better reality for you? Let me give you two specific beliefs I got from some of the books I\u2019ve read\u2026 Stress is good for you. Stress is bad for us, that\u2019s what society tells us. Whenever I felt stressed out in the past, I made a big deal out of it. I thought it was super unhealthy and I told myself that I shouldn\u2019t ever feel stressed. That all changed when I read The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Guess what? Stress is actually good for you! It helps you perform better and makes you more resilient in the future. It\u2019s only bad for you if you think it\u2019s bad. Duh! Nowadays I see stress as a positive sign. As a learning opportunity. As a way to grow and become a stronger version of myself. Anyone can get rich. I grew up in a family and culture where being rich was a bit frowned upon. I also didn\u2019t know any rich people. Instead, I clearly remember my mother often telling us that we\u2019re short on cash and we should be cautious when spending money. Getting rich seemed almost kind of magical and mythical\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly it wasn\u2019t possible for ordinary people. That changed when I read a summary of T. Harv Eker\u2019s Secrets of the Millionaire Mind. According to him, it\u2019s possible for anyone to become a millionaire. It\u2019s simply a matter of having the right mindset (!). And even though I\u2019m not rich yet, I\u2019m 100% convinced I can be a millionaire one day\u2026 if I want to\u2026 and if I put in enough time and effort. Oftentimes we\u2019re not at all aware of the programs and beliefs that are running the show in our lives. And if you don\u2019t read or learn or in any other way expose yourself to new ideas, new mindsets, new beliefs\u2026 Then guess what? Your programs will never change\u2026 and neither will your life. Bottom line: Reading opens you up to a whole new world. It shows you new possibilities, new ways of looking at things, new ways of living. Reading gives you the freedom to choose your own way. It shows you a way out of society\u2019s limited conditionings, programs, and worldviews. #5 Reading Inspires You to Do Great\u00a0Things Reading about other people and what they have achieved in life and how they made the world a better place is as motivating and inspiring as it gets. Read (auto-)biographies of great people. Read Mandela\u2019s story. Or Gandhi\u2019s story. Or Abraham Lincoln\u2019s story. Or Tiger Woods\u2019 story. Or Kobe Bryant\u2019s story. Or Elon Musk\u2019s story. What these people achieved is truly extraordinary. And by reading about them you will come to realize that they weren\u2019t born special. They got to where they got because of hard work, dedication, will, perseverance, persistence, and a relentless drive to overcome any obstacle life has thrown in their way. And look, you don\u2019t necessarly need to read biographies. Good books are packed with great stories of great people. I recently read Tim Grover\u2019s book \u201cRelentless\u201d (summary here). He was the personal coach of Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, and other legendary basketball champs. In the book, he talks about the day Kobe was drafted. While pretty much all the others went out to celebrate, guess what Kobe did? He went to the fucking gym to practice. A while back I read Laura Vanderkam\u2019s book What Successful People Do Before Breakfast. Most of these people get up super early. They work out in the morning. They meditate. They journal. They start working on their hardest tasks. They get more done before breakfast than most people during an entire day. It\u2019s pure inspiration. My point is, reading motivates and inspires you to do great things with your life. Bottom line: Reading about other people owning and dominating their lives makes you want to get up from your couch and do shit. It makes you want to make something happen. It makes you want to do more than just watch TV all day long. It\u2019s pure inspiration. #6 Reading Automatically Improves You at [Insert Topic of the\u00a0Book] Recently I came across this quote from Marcy Shimoff\u2019s book Happy for No Reason: \u201cIn 1977 Dr. Michael Fordyce, a psychologist and author of `The Psychology of Happiness, published the groundbreaking results of his experiment showing that students asked to study the habits of happy people actually increased their happiness and life satisfaction by just learning about the subject.\u201d Just learning about happiness makes you happier. And I\u2019ve found this to be true for any topic. I know this sounds too easy, but try it out for yourself. What\u2019s one thing you want to get better at in your life? Read a book about it. Want to be a better communicator? Read a book about it. Want to build more muscle mass? Read a book about it. Want to lose weight? Read a book about it. Want to become rich? Read a book about it. Want to travel the world? Read a book about it. Want to improve your golf score? Read a book about it. Bottom line: The act of reading and learning about a specific topic automatically makes you better at it. Want more happiness? Read a book on how to become happier. Simple as that. #7 Reading Upgrades Your Environment by Giving You Virtual Friends and\u00a0Mentors Ever heard of the following expression: \u201cYou are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJim Rohn Jim Rohn goes on to explain, \u201cYou will become the combined average of the five people you hang around the most. You will have the combined attitude, health and income of the five people you hang around the most.\u201d We absorb other people`s personalities, habits, styles, thought patterns, mindsets, and attitudes like a sponge. There\u2019s the saying that criminals are made, not born. Think about it. Nobody is born a criminal. It\u2019s a characteristic (like any other) that is developed gradually over time. It\u2019s circumstances like unemployment, child abuse, a \u201cbad\u201d neighborhood that slowly turn a person into a criminal. It\u2019s scientifically proven that children who have been abused are more likely to grow up to be criminals. They grew up with a lot of hate which is naturally absorbed into their personalities. That same child growing up with loving parents and in a \u201cgood\u201d neighborhood might become a completely different person. It\u2019s all in the environment. It\u2019s all about the people your surround yourself with. Ever wondered why Silicon Valley brings out so many millionaires? It`s because the people there are surrounded by so many other successful people. Kids grow up in a society where entrepreneurship, high achievement, success, and getting rich is normal. It`s really simple: If you want to be rich, hang around rich people. If you want to be funny, hang around funny people. If you want to be a great athlete, hang around other great athletes. If you want to be a total loser, hang around other losers. Now here\u2019s the kicker: It\u2019s not just about who you hang around with physically. If you read someone\u2019s book, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re hanging out with that person. It\u2019s almost as if the author is talking to you. And so you absorb his or her personality, mindsets, beliefs, and thought patterns. If you read Mandela\u2019s biography, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re hanging out with him. If you read Steve Jobs\u2019 biography, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re hanging out with him. Just think for a second how powerful that is. The authors of the books you read in a way become your friends and mentors. And so you start absorbing these great people\u2019s mindsets, beliefs, attitudes, thought patterns, and more. Are you starting to see the magic powers behind the simple act of reading? Bottom line: Reading someone\u2019s book helps you absorb that person\u2019s beliefs, mindsets, attitudes, and thought patterns. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re actually hanging out with that person\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s like having a virtual mentor.
