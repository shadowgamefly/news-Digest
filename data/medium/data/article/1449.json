{"name": "1449", "parent": "", "content": "All Natural Depression Face\u00a0Masks People often think depression looks a certain way\u200a\u2014\u200acrying, sad, or, just finished crying. But it\u2019s oh so much more than that! depression is chock-full of devastating layers. It runs deep and steady. I have an undercurrent of depression running through me at all times. Sometimes it\u2019s more pronounced, other times it\u2019s more Crouching Depression, Hidden Depression. But it\u2019s always there. I\u2019m still shocked that depressed people get told \u201cbut you don\u2019t look depressed\u201d because honestly how goddamn dare you. Who are you to say whether somebody looks depressed or not? Please acquaint yourself with the life-changing magic of shutting the fuck up. The only person who\u2019s qualified to tell me whether I look depressed or not, is the guy who puts out the rotisserie chicken at my local Safeway. The idea that something so deeply rooted in a person\u2019s mind would only be identifiable via their face is absurd. You can\u2019t recognize depression in someone just by looking at them, because guess what? We look JUST. LIKE. YOU. MWHAHAHAH! Isn\u2019t that terrifying, non-depressed people? It\u2019s impossible to tell who\u2019s depressed and who\u2019s not. We walk among you, like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. Each of us a perfect copy of a person, only devoid of human emotion. We apply different facial expressions out of habit, not because we feel, but because we want to appear as though we do. We wear these face masks for a multitude of reasons\u200a\u2014\u200ato gain acceptance, to shield from shame, or to achieve an even, healthy glow. Personally, I make a concerted effort to not look depressed in public, for the same reason I put on make-up, sure I do it to lie to other people, but it\u2019s mostly to lie to myself. For those of you still unconvinced, allow me to present some of my lesser-known All Natural Depression Face Masks: Extremely HappyAn absolute staple. I have been donning Extremely Happy for years and, even though it\u2019s torturous to wear, it will make you feel like part of society even though you\u2019re dying inside! And isn\u2019t that what\u2019s truly important? Societal acceptance! Extremely Happy\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s the LBD (little black depression) for your face. On Point ProfessionalWho says you can\u2019t be depressed AND good at your job? Probably most employers! On Point Professional can be worn by anyone who works for a living. Inspire your coworkers with a face that says \u201cI get shit done!\u201d and a mind that says \u201cMy mental condition is deteriorating and I can\u2019t make it stop!\u201d. For those of you who work from home, don\u2019t worry! You can wear On Point Professional all the time, or just on those rare occasions when you venture out the house because you want to make sure strangers on the street know you have a job because it\u2019s very important to impress people you don\u2019t (and will never) know. Very important. Sheer BoredomBoredom? How can you be bored when you have all this depression to be getting on with? What\u2019s your secret?! I\u2019ll tell you\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s a two-in-one look! That\u2019s right, Sheer Boredom blends seamlessly with your depression. Think depression can only be worn with Crying? Think again! Sheer Boredom is one of the most popular depression looks to date. So what are you waiting for? Death? Me too! Court Jester\u00a0I love this look because it\u2019s long-lasting and helps protect from any real feelings. Unlike Extremely Happy, Court Jester is so easy to wear you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re wearing it! That is until you\u2019re alone and you have to take it off. Then it will hit you, hard. All those thoughts and feelings you thought you\u2019d shielded yourself from by doing fun bits at parties, they\u2019re here now. It\u2019s just you, and them, and silence\u2026\u2026.Until the next social event or after-work drinks or dinner party! Put Court Jester back on and let the laughter feed you! Haha! Who\u2019s laughing now?! Not you! Iridescent IndifferenceWithout a doubt, the coolest look of the bunch. Iridescent Indifference\u2019s unique numbing agent makes you look like a nonplussed, French New Wave film on the outside, while you continue to feel dead on the inside. You look at other people and wonder how and why they can be into any activity. You convince yourself that you\u2019re too cool for that shit, which maybe works for a while. Then you realize, at least these people have shit they care about. You don\u2019t even have shit you don\u2019t care about. But at least you have Iridescent Indifference! Cool on the outside, nothing on the inside! There you have it, just a few of my classic looks. If these don\u2019t resonate with you, then dig around and see what you find or don\u2019t because it\u2019s horrifying! Also, save your \u201cI don\u2019t experience this\u201d comments. I wrote this about my condition, not yours. Hope this helps! But remember, if in doubt, keep your mouth shut.
