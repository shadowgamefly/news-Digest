Step 2: What about the 2nd most popular project for each\u00a0country? The 2nd most starred project per country on GitHub during 2016\u200a\u2014\u200anaive\u00a0count. The 2nd most starred project for each country shows more variety results: Let\u2019s skip the top 75 worldwide GitHub projects, and only then choose the most popular project per\u00a0country: A list of the most interesting GitHub projects for each\u00a0country: Let\u2019s get a list of top projects for each country, this time with some rules: And these are our results: Joshua Levy appears on top of the US\u200a\u2014\u200aAmericans show a lot of attention to compensation. It\u2019s great to see Kelsey Hightower in this list too with his Kubernetes in hard mode. On data\u200a\u2014\u200aI love data, in this case coming from FiveThirtyEight. And thanks Alex Gaynor for teaching us \u201cwhat happens when\u201d, Ben Brown for chat bots, J Delaney for easy applications, and everyone else listed here and beyond! China\u200a\u2014\u200athey love WeChat\u200a\u2014\u200aand they have their own version of FreeCodeCamp. Germany\u200a\u2014\u200aDaniel Quinn is Canadian who lives in the UK, nevertheless Germans starred his project paperless to the top. UK\u200a\u2014\u200agreat to see Max Woolf and Kelsey Hightower again. And on top of the UK, Rich Harris\u2019s Svelte. India seems to pay a lot of attention to CS educational repositories. Brazil\u200a\u2014\u200awhere the top project translates to \u201clove Serenade\u201d and its mission is to give \u201cArtificial Intelligence for social control of public administration\u201d. Tell me more, Irio Musskopf at Data Science Brigade. Russia\u200a\u2014\u200ayandex is big there, as well as YoptaScript (as in Ukraine). France seems to be big into PHP. I\u2019d love to learn more. Japan\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t know much about these projects, but they seem very Japanese oriented. Canada\u200a\u2014\u200aseems not only the us cares about stock options compensation. Australia\u200a\u2014\u200anot many Australian exclusive projects show up, but some of the ones we already saw. Not sure why relax/relax is big here, as their top maintainers live in Portugal (Bruno Mota, for example). Taiwan\u200a\u2014\u200awhere the top project mission is to \u201cMake the Taiwan a Better Place to Work\u201d. I like it.

Makes sense. Spain\u200a\u2014\u200aKarumi is a Spanish company, and their Android framework is the top project for Spain. Great to see open data as their #2. (comments pending) Netherlands\u200a\u2014\u200aThey also pay a lot of attention to Max\u2019s big list of naughty strings. (comments pending) South Korea\u200a\u2014\u200aopen government on top. Also interesting to see Apache Zeppelin on top of this country ranking, as I met many of its developers in Seoul (hello Seoul Engineer!). Italy\u200a\u2014\u200awhere you can find the constitutional reform on top of their GitHub projects (and maybe send pull requests?). (comments pending) (comments pending) (comments pending) Switzerland\u200a\u2014\u200anot only Germany has danielquinn/paperless within the top, Switzerland too. But the top project is \u201can opensource, publicly owned evoting system. It is the result of the collaboration between the Geneva State Chancellery and the Geneva IT Department\u201d. Good.
