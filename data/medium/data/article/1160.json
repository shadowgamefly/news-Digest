We all know that the time change was instituted in an attempt to save energy. But I\u2019ll bet you also have first-hand experience of some of the pros and cons of this practice. In my case, I vividly remember showing up at the school bus stop on a snowy November morning (this was in Canada) to find nobody there, feeling like I was the only person in the world and slowly realizing that it wasn\u2019t even 7 a.m. \u201cAlone in This Beautiful World\u201d by Matthew Skelton,\u00a0source To add insult to injury, I then trudged back home to find the door locked, my parents having already left for work, equally oblivious to the time change. Obviously, this was before the days of cell phones and computers automatically resetting the time! Such humiliating memories aside, ever wonder whether the time change has any effect on our health and productivity? You may be surprised to hear that since its establishment, the time change has been blamed for all sorts of health problems, from heart attacks to early labor in pregnant women. In fact, there is even a debate between two teams of researchers about whether the time change negatively affects the U.S. stock market! [1] Fortunately, many of these fears seem to be unfounded. For example, a recent Swedish study examined the incidence of spontaneous deliveries (where a pregnant woman went into labor without being induced by medications) over a period of 13 years and found no increase in births in the week following a time change. [2] Similarly, the time change doesn\u2019t seem to increase the incidence of heart attacks\u200a\u2014\u200aphew! [3] As you might predict, the fall time change comes more easily to our bodies than the spring time change, in which we \u201close\u201d an hour of nighttime. [4] In the spring, workers tend to get 40 minutes less of sleep on the Monday following the time change. [5] Many psychologists believe that lack of sleep leads to a decreased ability to regulate one\u2019s behavior; interestingly, the Monday after the spring time change is usually a day of increased \u201ccyberloafing\u201d, or goofing off online while at work. [6] Photo by Mario,\u00a0source There is some indication that people also have trouble making ethical or moral judgments on the Monday after the spring time change as well. [7] More troubling still, that day also sees more workplace injuries as well as injuries of greater severity than on other workdays, although not all studies agree on this [5,8]. Fortunately, there is no increase in injuries on the Monday following the fall time change. [5] Still, a 1-hour shift in our sleep schedules does decrease our performance somewhat, as shown by slower reaction times on a test of attention catchily called the Psychomotor Vigilance Test. [9] It\u2019s very simple: the subject watches a dark screen, on which a dot of light spontaneously appears every few seconds over a span of 10 minutes; the subject has to press a button every time the dot appears. The screen in a psychomotor vigilance test. Image: Maria Ter-Mikaelian Sleep-deprived people tend to \u201ctune out\u201d and miss the appearance of the dot, so it\u2019s a good test of sleepiness and alertness. This means that if your work involves meticulous attention to detail or the need to react quickly, you will have to be extra careful this coming Monday. Indeed, because of its troubling side-effects, some experts believe that Daylight Saving Time does more harm than good. For example, Christopher Barnes, whose research on DST in relation to health and productivity includes several of the studies discussed above, recently co-authored an article arguing that Daylight Saving Time should be abolished in the U.S. altogether. [10] In fact, several U.S. states and territories\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, Arizona, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico\u200a\u2014\u200ado not observe DST. In addition, some countries, such as Russia, have recently abandoned the practice. It will be interesting to see whether research reveals noticeable differences in health or work performance in those regions. For this year, at least, most North Americans are stuck with DST.

In the meantime, my suggestion to you is: this coming Monday, arm yourself with some upbeat music and a strong cup of coffee, and if you must, do a little cyberloafing to ease the transition.
