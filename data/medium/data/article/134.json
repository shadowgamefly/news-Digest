{"name": "134", "parent": "", "content": "Malcolm Jenkins on What Effect Trump Will Have on the\u00a0NFL The current administration can put some of the league\u2019s players in a challenging position Eight-year NFL veteran Malcolm Jenkins is a former Pro Bowler, a Super Bowl champion, and an activist. He\u2019s one of the players who protested during the national anthem, following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s lead throughout the season. But the NFL\u200a\u2014\u200alike the country\u200a\u2014\u200ais in a different place now than it was in the fall of 2016. Jenkins joined Kevin Clark on The Ringer NFL Show to discuss how his outspokenness has been handled by the Eagles and how the new Trump administration could affect the NFL. Jenkins has been outspoken not only during the national anthem, but in interviews and on Twitter as well. When asked about whether he\u2019s received any pushback from the team, Jenkins responded: \u201cI personally didn\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s because of who I am on the team. There is a little bit more trust in my thoughtfulness, but I know it wasn\u2019t the same for every player. There are teams like the Dolphins where the owner has the organization rise [for the anthem], there\u2019s teams like San Francisco who backed Colin Kaepernick fully and matched his donation of a million dollars [to local charities]. Then there\u2019s other ones who, I won\u2019t put any names to it, are really good friends with our president and are on the opposite end of that. So, it\u2019s hard for me to tell guys on different teams in different positions how to navigate this environment, because it changes depending on which team you\u2019re on.\u201d He also addressed how the 2016 election will reverberate in the NFL and what the Trump presidency means. \u201cNow you have a president who, so far, has not mentioned anything about criminal justice reform, has talked about stop-and-frisk, has talked about sending more police to Chicago, [has made] more executive orders to back and support police without doing anything to back and support communities, [and] has talked about cutting the budget that includes community and police relationship-building. Because that\u2019s the direction that this administration is going, there is a huge push to wake people out right now. Before he redoes everything that\u2019s been put in place, and we take steps back and then things get worse.\u201d When it comes to Trump, would Jenkins join a team whose owner supports the White House? Jenkins doesn\u2019t see that kind of protest as effective: \u201cI mean, business is business. It\u2019s kind of a trend right now that, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree with [my] philosophy, I cannot support or I can\u2019t even sit in the same room with you.\u2019 I think that\u2019s a bad precedent to set. But I will not go to a team that will not allow me to use my voice and use my right to free speech. That I will not do. If you had somebody who is forcing their will and their status upon you to suppress you, then that\u2019s totally different. And so far, we haven\u2019t heard any of that or haven\u2019t had any hard evidence, but just like I know I might not support this president, I can\u2019t knock other people who do. What I can do is sit down and talk and listen to why they do and what concerns they have and vice versa.\u201d Listen to the full podcast here. This transcript has been edited and condensed.
