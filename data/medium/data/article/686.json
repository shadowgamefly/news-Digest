Intuitive teamwork leads to high performance\u200a\u2014\u200awhich results in employees less likely leaving your organization. People who derive fulfillment through wonder are driven by internal growth compared to their externally growth motivated peers. In today\u2019s high tech powered environment, that\u2019s innovating at super high rates, with artificial intelligence replacing human intelligence in higher and higher skill jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aaccelerated learning is the most important skill to cultivate for a high performing organization. Fast invention and testing is of utmost importance and fast knowledge sharing is a must to stay competitive. How \u2018Why\u2019 Relates to Your People and Organization A persons \u2018why\u2019 or \u2018why statement\u2019 is the meaning they assign to their existence\u200a\u2014\u200aand if someone\u2019s \u2018why\u2019 is wonder, they are higher level thinkers and consider themselves a smaller part of a bigger, more important purpose. They\u2019re often considered people of \u201cfaith\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter what that faith may be. I think the by-product of faith in anything becomes wonder. This frame of reference creates \u2018bigger picture\u2019 thinking, which creates an excitement to live while being selfless\u200a\u2014\u200aa powerful combination which creates enthusiastic action. People with wonder absorb knowledge and benevolently share that knowledge. They\u2019re less likely to be competitive with internal peers and have an organizational sense of \u201cI win if they win, and if they win, I win\u201d. They\u2019re likely to believe that \u2018life is great\u2019 and can be enthusiastic about anything\u200a\u2014\u200aand don\u2019t believe enthusiasm is a result based on the external task being worked on\u200a\u2014\u200awhich many people struggle to understand and thus put their personal interests before the organizations. People with \u2018innocent wonderment\u2019 are enthusiastic all the time. Hiring Wonder will create a culture that values introspective growth and a positive attitude toward daily tasks\u200a\u2014\u200awhich creates harmony for the organization. People who \u2018wonder\u2019 naturally learn voraciously and most importantly, share that knowledge which uplifts the people around them and set\u2019s an example for others to improve and do the same. In studying 24,000 people at dozens of companies, Dr. David Logan, author of Tribal Leadership, the framework Zappos built it\u2019s world re-known culture on, and legendary basketball coach Phil Jackson\u200a\u2014\u200awho lead world class athletes to eleven championships with\u200a\u2014\u200aconcluded that top performing organizations are made up of people who\u2019s behavior and relationship toward their peers is driven by a collective selflessness and love for living that creates a healthy and sustainable organizational culture\u200a\u2014\u200awith \u2018innocent wonderment\u2019 being the top behavior trait. If someone has a high score in \u2018wonder\u2019, they\u2019ve achieved a level of inner self-actualization and satisfaction that creates a sense of contentment that mitigates the risk of them leaving the organization. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve achieved their external potential yet, but have high self-esteem and know they\u2019ll reach their peak in due time. \u201cMy philosophy is that you don\u2019t motivate players with speeches, you have motivated players that you draft.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aPhil Jackson Jackson recruited for innocent wonderment and his leadership philosophy was based on Dr. Logan\u2019s Culture Map. In his book, \u201c11 Rings, The Soul of Success, he writes: \u201cin the 2008\u20132009 season, the Lakers needed to shift from a Stage 3 team to a Stage 4 in order to win.\u201d Stage four is a high bar to maintain, and the general state of a high performing organization\u200a\u2014\u200aand is reached when striving for stage five. The risk wonder mitigates for is \u2018contentment and satisfaction\u2019 in one\u2019s vocation, lot in life, and place in the world\u200a\u2014\u200awhich often makes millennials discontent in their jobs. Therefore, people with wonder are more likely to remain content and satisfied for longer periods of time. New hires entering the work force and leaving jobs on average after eighteen months and people with wonder are less likely to \u2018hop around\u2019 for external advancement. These are people who could stock shelves at Zappos for two years and make a good time of it\u200a\u2014\u200apeople who don\u2019t even realize they\u2019ve advanced to manager and VP, because\u200a\u2014\u200ain their mind stocking shelves and being VP are the same subjective experience\u200a\u2014\u200ajust different day to day tasks. Your people are your most important assets and determine how your organization operates each day. It can be a happy and healthy force for sustainable growth and innovation\u200a\u2014\u200awhere people\u2019s knowledge and sharing benevolently drive it forward as a cohesive team. Transparency, internal coaching of peers and fluid communication make these things align and hiring for wonder is the best way to make that happen.
