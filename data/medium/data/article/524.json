{"name": "524", "parent": "", "content": "How to write a content marketing strategy step-by-step [with template] The good news: your boss or client is totally on board with your running content marketing. (SCORE!) The challenge: she wants to see a content marketing plan\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and you have NO IDEA what that\u2019s supposed to look like. I\u2019ve been there. It\u2019s a tough situation, because you\u2019ve been doing content marketing with your gut this whole time, and now you\u2019re being asked to put all that into a document. (And the gut-to-document process can be pretty painful.) Plus, you know that awesome content marketing involves a lot of flexibility\u200a\u2014\u200ahow do you build that into a strategic document? Good news: we\u2019ve scoured the Internet for content marketing strategy templates, tried a few, and put together an approach to building your own content marketing plan step-by-step. (This is built with both the in-house content marketer and the agent in mind, BTW!) Let\u2019s go! Preface Before we get too far in, I\u2019d love to start things off with a few quick notes: 1. This is a long article. Feel free to bookmark or send to Pocket to set aside some time to hash through this. Also, you can download the full article (plus the content marketing strategy template) and read it later, if you like. Or if you\u2019re keen, we\u2019ve bundled the most essential sections of this post into a 5-part, on-demand email series that you can get for free right here. 2. Content marketing strategies aren\u2019t easy to write. We\u2019re going to dig into big strategies like website crawls and persona profiles and thematic taxonomies and competitive analyses. (I had to learn a good deal of stuff I was unfamiliar with in order to start writing these, too!) At each step, I\u2019ve included some recommended material for further reading. 3. This isn\u2019t gospel. Like the pirate code, these are more guidelines than actual rules. =) You\u2019ll find that some projects need more in-depth planning than others. 4. Stay flexible. A strong content marketing strategy should give you focus, not lock you into less-than-awesome ideas! The key to a great content marketing strategy is being able to tweak, break, and chuck parts of it as you learn more about what works and what doesn\u2019t. All right, now that we\u2019ve covered the caveats, let\u2019s look at how to write this content marketing strategy! How to write a content marketing strategy step-by-step Let\u2019s walk though how you can write a content marketing strategy\u200a\u2014\u200aone that pulls together all the pieces and gives you a clear plan for moving forward. Step 1: Start with an\u00a0outline Writing a strategy can sound like a daunting task. How detailed should it be? How high-level should it be? Starting with an outline can help you conceptualize all the ground you need to cover\u200a\u2014\u200aand it may save you from expending your energy covering unnecessary ground! And what is the right ground to cover anyway? A good content marketing strategy will answer three basic questions: Your outline will help you structure your research and ideation so that you\u2019re focused on answering these key questions. For example, one way this could look is by splitting the remaining steps below (all 20 of \u2019em) into each of these buckets. The outline, then, could look a little something like this: For the rest of these steps, I\u2019m going to work through a basic outline template that has helped me in both in-house and agency roles. (And I\u2019d be more than happy to email you a copy of this outline to copy or tweak!) Once you\u2019ve got an outline, it\u2019s time to start with what you know: yourself. Step 2: Write down what you\u2019re trying to accomplish This is where you\u2019ll write out your content marketing goals. What are you trying to accomplish? It helps if this is specific, because later on in this process, you will be comparing your content to your goals to see what\u2019s truly in alignment. This may express itself as a big objective with smaller SMART goals folded underneath (SMART stands for \u201cSpecific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely\u201d). An example may be: Goal: To become perceived as a thought leader on the phenomenon of Roomba rodeos. Note: A great question to ask for added context might be: What are the overall marketing goals, and how can content marketing support them? I\u2019ve found that some organizations group content marketing into a separate team (or outsource the efforts), which means it may be wise to get some advice from other non\u2013content marketing folks in your organization. (Protip: sometimes asking other teams and departments for content input is a great way to build a culture of content in your organization!) Once you\u2019ve written down these goals, you can ask yourself (and your team) a few questions: This is where you\u2019ll outline your content KPIs (key performance indicators). For more thoughts on setting marketing goals, check out this best-of list of methods from experts like Noah Kagan, Ryan Holiday, Rand Fishkin, our own Courtney Seiter. You might also want to swipe some goal-setting templates from HubSpot\u2019s Mike Lemire. Step 3 (optional): Write down what you\u2019re\u00a0selling I\u2019ve found it helpful to write out what the product or service I\u2019m trying to sell is. It helps me think through the features, the different product tiers, the sales cycle, etc. When you know what you\u2019re selling, you can more easily frame the kind of content you will need to sell it. Of course, you may be the product creator, the marketer, the one-human show, and this might not be something you need to write down. If not, feel free to skip this part. Step 4: Now, who\u2019s going to consume your\u00a0content? It\u2019s time to outline who the audience for your content marketing efforts is going to be. If you\u2019ve done some of your persona research already, huzzah! You can plug those little blocks of fictional, alliterative goodness here. Don\u2019t have your buyer personas fleshed out yet? Now\u2019s a terrific time to get started on this! Here are a few resources to help you start developing your own personas: Step 5: Map your personas\u2019 needs to your product or\u00a0service Jay Acunzo wrote my very favorite definition of content marketing: Solving the same problem or conveying the same emotion as your product, using media you create and distribute. Once you\u2019ve looked at who your audience is, you need to ask one crucial question: How can you help them? This question is the heart and soul of content marketing. Your whole content marketing plan will benefit from writing this out. The key to this step is to map your persona\u2019s pain points, goals, and desires to the solutions you want to sell. This might look like making a table with brief descriptions of each. Or it might be something you\u2019d like to write out in story form\u200a\u2014\u200asomething Moz\u2019s Isla McKetta has some super helpful thoughts on! Again, this step is key, because the rest of this strategy is going to be about creating and upgrading and curating and promoting content that solves the same problems your product solves! Step 6 (optional): Heroes and watering\u00a0holes You\u2019re laying a terrific foundation for your content strategy. You\u2019ve dug through your personas\u2019 deepest wants and needs and mapped those to your product. You\u2019re getting an idea of what kinds of problems your content needs to solve. Things are starting to take shape. There\u2019s another (optional) thing I like to look at before leaving the audience section of the content marketing plan, though. I like to know: Where is my audience already going for this kind of information? This is a fun exercise I\u2019ve nicknamed \u201cheroes and watering holes.\u201d (You can probably come up with a better name for it!) I call them that because at this stage in the content marketing plan, it\u2019s good to start thinking of the sources of information the audience already trusts. Those sources generally fall into two groups: If you examine where your audience is already going for information, you can get a more comprehensive view of the content marketplace. It can help protect you from trying to reinvent any content wheels, and it can give you some awesome ideas for guest posting\u200a\u2014\u200athe lifeblood of the early content marketing strategy at Buffer! Unless you have a really wide reach, you can probably use your own intuition to map out your audience\u2019s influencers. But if you\u2019d like a more data-driven approach, you may want to use tools like FollowerWonk and BuzzSumo. Step 7: Look to the competition\u2019s content marketing efforts for inspiration It\u2019s good to know what kind of content your audience wants. It\u2019s fantastic to know what kind of content your competitors are already giving them. You don\u2019t need to do a deep-dive competitive analysis for every single content marketing plan you write, but you will probably find it helpful to take a moment to reflect on just what other people and brands are offering your personas. By the way, when you think about competition in terms of content marketing, it can work a little differently than you might imagine. Your competitors aren\u2019t necessarily the organizations that are competing for customer dollars. When it comes to content marketing, your competitors are the people and organizations that are competing for your audience\u2019s attention. This is generally a good place in your content strategy to ask a few questions: It\u2019s helpful to think through the ways that your content can uniquely appeal to your personas. Will you offer more long-form, deep tactical content? Will your content be more visually oriented? Will your content be crafted with a distinctively delightful tone? This graphic from Garrett Moon of CoSchedule does a great job explaining this concept (the blue ocean blogs are what you\u2019d aim for): This piece of the strategy will help you orient yourself in the content marketplace, so that you, your team, and/or your client can create content marketing pieces that stand out rather than blend in. Not sure who your competitors are? There are a few ways to find out. One of my favorites: SEMRush. They show you which websites are ranking for the same keywords in search engines as you\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is super helpful! At a glance, you can see who else is getting organic and paid search engine attention for the keywords you might be targeting. Step 8: Take inventory of your\u00a0content OK, this step could be its own blog post. Or blog series. Or book. Or director\u2019s edition extended cut DVD set. You get the idea: taking inventory of your marketing content is no small task. Let\u2019s get a high-level view of what this could look like, and then I\u2019ll be happy to share some links for further reading. When you take inventory of your content, you get a list of all your content marketing assets (both onsite and offsite). This could be as general as a list of channels. For example, if Buffer were to do a high-level content inventory without digging into the details, it might look like this: Onsite Offsite Even something as simple as this is helpful\u200a\u2014\u200abut only to the extent of figuring out where all your content might be. The deeper dive into these individual content marketing assets (a fantastic exercise if you\u2019re up for it) would include: everything. It\u2019s a great deal of work. But you emerge from it being incredibly well-attuned to the state of content marketing for your brand. In short, what we\u2019re looking at here is a content audit. And how do you do a content audit? There are many, many tools and blog posts that can help you do this, but here are a few that I\u2019ve personally found invaluable. Step 9: Evaluate your existing\u00a0content Now that you\u2019ve put together a list of your content marketing assets, it\u2019s time to line them up against those objectives we covered at the beginning of this plan. The central question we\u2019re trying to answer: Which pieces of content are aligned with our objectives? (With a follow-up: Which pieces of content can we reorient to align with our objectives?) One approach I find super helpful here is to map out the most important pieces of content from the inventory on a matrix like the one below. The X axis plots performance: that\u2019s metrics like pageviews, likes, shares, comments, and rankings. The Y axis plots alignment, which is a little fuzzier. The higher up a piece of content is, the more in alignment with our brand\u2019s goals and ethos it is. When looking at the content you\u2019ve inventoried, which content falls into which quadrants? (You could assign a quadrant value to each type of content if you like, but unless you\u2019re dealing with a hefty budget, your intuition will work just fine.) Some resources that help with evaluating content performance: When you\u2019ve finished this, it\u2019s time to ask four important questions: What sticks? (Step\u00a010) This speaks to that sweet, sweet top-right corner of the matrix, where your content is aligned with your brand and acing performance. One thing I find helpful in a content strategy is to list out the content assets that are already performing well at this point. What should we fix? (Step\u00a011) There will probably be bits of content in quadrants 1 and 4 that could get bumped into quadrant 4 with a little love and care. Make a list of the pieces that really have potential to turn into high-value content marketing assets, along with the ways in which they could be improved. For example, you may notice that your \u201chow-to\u201d infographics are generating some super positive comments, but they\u2019re not getting very many shares or backlinks. You might want to take note of this, as this will be worked into the content strategy later. What should we nix? (Step\u00a012) Where\u2019s the dead weight? There may be some content in quadrant 3 that\u2019s just not doing you any favors. No backlinks, no likes, no rankings\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just clutter. (This may also include totally outdated content.) If it\u2019s no good, don\u2019t be afraid to put it on the list to be nixed. It\u2019ll clear up space and help you focus on the content that\u2019s most important. What do we add to the mix? (Step\u00a013) And here\u2019s where your content marketing strategy begins to take on that epic creative element! After meticulously combing over your content, what ideas do you get for new content? What assets could be driving business objectives? What has your brand overlooked? What have you always wanted to try? (This is probably my favorite part of writing content marketing strategies!) Step 14 (optional): Sort your effective and prospective content marketing assets by\u00a0theme You\u2019ve audited all your content. Huzzah! We\u2019re about to move into the part of the strategy that deals with making this content, but first, let\u2019s pull some of this audit together by identifying some major content themes. This will play a big part in mapping out a content production and promotion schedule soon. Look at the content that sticks. By asking these questions, we can start building out content themes: these are the broad umbrella topics that your best content tends to group under. This is the time in the content marketing strategizing stage where I find it helpful to write these down. Doing so helps hone the plan for producing new content around these themes\u200a\u2014\u200awhich makes things a lot simpler for the folks writing, designing, and coding the content! Step 15: Refill your\u00a0coffee I hope you will have done so long before reaching this step, but I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder. \ud83d\ude09 Step 15 (for serious): List the types of content you\u2019ll be dealing\u00a0with You\u2019ve completed a huge component of this strategy piece: you\u2019ve combed through all your content and channels to find what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and what you\u2019d like to create. Well done. Very well done! Now we need to start making a plan for producing content. Just for reference, \u201cproducing content\u201d covers two general areas of content crafting: We\u2019ll start by listing out the kind of work this will involve, namely, the types of content that need to be crafted. This might include: Once you have a list of the kinds of content you\u2019re dealing with, you may want to give each one a brief description. For example, you could write: This is key, because in the next steps, you\u2019ll outline how these kinds of content will be made. Step 16: Snapshot the content team and\u00a0workflow One trap that I often fall into is underestimating how long it will take to create a piece of content. (Confession: I\u2019m finishing this post two days later than I originally planned on it being done!) That\u2019s why, when laying out a content strategy, it\u2019s good to get an idea of who\u2019s working on the content, and how that content is going to be created. The goal: get an idea of how much content you have capacity for. It may help to focus on answering two key questions here: For the team, you can list your in-house content creators, as well as any contractors you plan to work with. For the workflow, this is a simple step-by-step breakdown of the content creation/fixing process. It could look like, \u201cIdeate > Write > Design > Edit > Schedule > Promote,\u201d or it could be more involved than this. This is a tricky one, especially if you\u2019re proposing the first content marketing strategy for an organization. You face a host of unknowns. How long will it take to hire content specialists? How much will it cost to get a designer to make your infographics? How successful will content promotion efforts be? The good news: You don\u2019t need to have all the answers here. In fact, sometimes this exercise is most helpful at identifying the elements of content creation that we haven\u2019t figured out yet! What\u2019s important is that you have some idea of where this content marketing effort is coming from. Refining this piece is an ongoing process. =) Step 17: Estimate your content\u00a0capacity Once you\u2019ve outlined everything you can in the previous step, it\u2019s time to estimate just how much content can be created in the next span of time. If you\u2019re outsourcing this part to a team of experienced content marketers, content production might follow a reliable timetable. But if your team is just getting into content marketing, this can be a tough one. This is where it helps to ask for advice from people with experience. And if you can\u2019t know for sure, guess. The key here is to find a level of content production your team is confident they can take on, and then go for it. If you end up with lots of unfinished tasks at the end of the month, you can adjust expectations. If you finish way ahead of time, you can either ramp up production or invest in even higher-quality content. Either way, you want to have an idea of how much content you can make. Pro-tip: a spreadsheet may come in handy here! You can create columns for content type, estimated hours, quantity of pieces, and finally a total. This can help you build a few possible breakdowns of your content capacity. Step 18: Map out your editorial calendar You know what content you\u2019re going to make. You know how you\u2019re going to make it, and you have an idea of how long it\u2019s going to take. Now, when will you publish it? It\u2019s time to map out your editorial calendar for your content marketing assets. This is where you plot your blog posts, emails, ebooks, podcasts, etc. across a given patch of time, be it months, quarters, or semesters. (You could go longer, but I\u2019ve found it helpful to keep the scope of time small enough for you to stay flexible and pivot based on what kind of content is performing.) One thing to keep in mind: you don\u2019t necessarily need to plan out every single piece of individual content on this calendar from the get-go. But it will help to map out how those content themes from Step 14 and the content types you listed in Step 16 will be spread across the next time period. Protip: It\u2019s easy to forget social media posting schedules here (since blogging and email take up a decent amount of brainspace). You may want to map out some of your social content schedule on the editorial calendar. Your social media conversations will understandably be more fluid than blog posts or emails, so this doesn\u2019t need to be the end-all social media schedule. It\u2019s just something to consider, as you may find it helpful just so you can see it in context of the rest of your content production. =) One more protip: This is a great place to include your guest blogging and syndication efforts, too! A few tools to consider for your editorial calendar: Step 19: Make a content promotion workflow If you publish a blog post in a forest, but nobody is around to read it, does it make a sound? \ud83d\ude1b Probably not. Creating amazing content is incredibly important, but there\u2019s SO MUCH content being made every day! You\u2019re going to need to find a way to get your awesome blog posts and infographics and podcasts in front of the right eyeballs. You don\u2019t just want a plan for making content. You want a plan for driving attention to it. This is a great time in the content marketing plan building process to map that out. How will you drive traffic to your content? You can start with a very simple process for doing so. It could be as straightforward as this: Full disclosure: that\u2019s not a complete list of things you can do, by any means\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially that last item. You\u2019ll want to promote your content through those heroes and watering holes you described at the beginning of this strategy, and you\u2019ll want to do it in a way that makes them look forward to getting more content from you. There\u2019s a lot that can be said when it comes to figuring out a content promotion workflow. For now, it\u2019s important that you have some means of driving traffic to your content once it\u2019s published. For more on content promotion plans and tactics, go read anything (or everything!) by Brian Dean. I\u2019ve found this video and this guide to be especially insightful. And here\u2019s a peek at the content distribution checklist used at Buffer: Step 20: Write the\u00a0epilogue Sum up your content strategy by painting an awesome picture of what it will be like if you execute on it. You can put lots of interesting things here, including experiments you hope to learn from and awesome blogs your content might be featured on. But, of course, the most important thing to do is briefly wrap up your strategy by relating it to those business objectives you listed at the very beginning. =) Step 21: Write the executive summary You\u2019ve done it. You have put together the epic content marketing strategy. You might be sitting on top of a 20-page document. Heck, if you\u2019re working with a really big organization, it could be pushing 50 pages. You have just made yourself the ultimate expert on your content. Your boss or client is going to be totally floored by the amount of time and research and thought you just put into this. And they won\u2019t have time to read it. =) That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to circle back around and add an executive summary to the beginning of your content strategy. Think of it as a TL;DR that answers four basic questions: Ka-BAM! You\u2019re done. =D Download this content marketing strategy template for yourself!
