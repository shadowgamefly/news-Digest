President Trump stepped in to broker the peace between his squabbling advisers, but White House insiders say his legendary dealmaking skills may have fallen\u00a0short. After a series of lengthy discussions over the weekend, brokered by the self-professed \u201cworld\u2019s greatest dealmaker,\u201d the Trump administration reported that the two senior advisers had kissed and made up. But a leaked transcript suggests that the feud may not be over. Judge for yourself: President Trump: Now, listen, you two, this squabbling is making me look like a lousy leader and a disorganized schmuck. Knock it off and start playing nice with each other! Jared Kusher: But he called me a \u2018cuck\u2019 and a \u2018globalist.\u2019 Trump: Steve, don\u2019t call Jared a cock and an obelisk anymore. Steve Bannon: I called him a cuck, not a cock. And a globalist, not an obelisk. He\u2019s a \u201ccuckservative\u201d because he\u2019s a cuckolded political wimp who won\u2019t embrace true alt-right conservatism. And he\u2019s a globalist because he\u2019s trying to push the Zionist message of tolerance and diversity on this administration instead of the doctrines of white supremacy and nationalism. So I\u2019m right on both counts. Trump: Well, I do kind of agree with Steve on the cuckold part, Jared. I see your mamby-pambying around my daughter and I wince. No pussy grabbing, no smacking her around to get her in line\u2014she\u2019s never going to respect you if you don\u2019t rough her up. Ivanka: Daddy, that\u2019s horrible! Trump: Be quiet, sweetie, just go back to playing with your hair. Kushner: All I know is that calling someone a globalist is a thinly veiled, anti-Semitic slur, and I won\u2019t stand for it. Trump: Is that true, Steve? Bannon: Yeah, it\u2019s true. And besides being a wonderkike, Jared\u2019s also a blue diaper baby\u200a\u2014\u200aa fucking Democrat! Deny it, you little gefilthy fish. Kushner: That\u2019s a lie! I\u2019m as much a Republican as the president is. Right, Dad? Trump: Uh, let\u2019s not go there. Look, I\u2019m gonna allow the globalist thing, because the Zionist piece sounds accurate to me. And you can taunt Jared from time to time with \u2018kike, \u2018hymie,\u2019 or \u2018Jew boy,\u2019 Steve\u200a\u2014\u200aGod knows, I do. But I don\u2019t want to hear you calling him a Democrat any more. That\u2019s just a low blow, understood? Bannon: Kike, hymie, Zionist, Jew-boy\u2026all good. Democrat\u2026off limits. But if you check his voting records for the past 15 years, you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s a lifelong donkey licker. Ivanka: Daddy, don\u2019t let that awful man call Jared a donkey licker, that\u2019s horrible! President Trump said his daughter, Ivanka, was a strong voice in settling the Kushner-Bannon civil war until she had to run out for a hair appointment. Trump: Ivanka, leaf through the photos in your fashion magazines and let the men talk. Steve, no more donkey licker, okay? Now, Jared, I want you to clear the air with Steve. What are your gripes? Kushner: You mean besides the fact that he\u2019s a fanatical ideologue, a vicious anti-Semite, an anarchist who welcomes an apocalyptic world-ending war, and someone who I disagree with on every policy issue from health care and immigration to taxes and trade? Okay, how about the fact that his open facial sores ooze all over my Brooks Brothers suits whenever his blood pressure goes up, which is like every time the second hand hits the twelve?! Trump: Ugh, oozing sores, someone get me a trash can, I think I\u2019m going to puke. (President Trump is heard on the audiotape retching into a receptacle of some kind, then asks for a glass of water and resumes.) Okay, Steve, this is getting disgusting. I\u2019ve talked to you before about those skin boils and abscesses. Either you see a dermatologist next week or you\u2019re out. Got that? I\u2019m also going to suggest that you see a shrink. Your inner rage is boiling to the surface and manifesting as skin lesions. That\u2019s a real thing, I saw it on Oprah. You need to work on your anger issues. Bannon: Yes, sir, I\u2019m sorry about the facial eruptions. I thought the Clearasil would take care of it, but it hasn\u2019t worked. Trump: Alright, now shake hands the two of you, and get back to work. And no more bickering\u200a\u2014\u200awhen you quarrel, I can\u2019t hear the goddamn television. Okay, get out of here and go make America great again! Ivanka: What should I do Daddy? Trump: You\u2019re already doing an amazing job, angel. You just keep looking through those beauty magazines, see you if you can find Daddy a more presidential hair gel. (The hushed voices of Bannon and Kushner are then heard, picked up by several hallway listening devices, as the two are exiting the Oval Office.) Bannon: I\u2019m going to get you, you pathetic little pantywaisted, blue-diapered, Jew-boy!
