Either way, because of my throat cancer, I had about a dozen reasons not to come here, the least of which was that I wouldn\u2019t know a lot of the people. It\u2019s still difficult for me to speak. I have to catch my breath more frequently, so I talk at an unfamiliar pace. It\u2019s not my natural cadence. It\u2019s as if someone else was talking. Eating and drinking is still difficult.

Although I am grateful to be here and to pretend to be a normal person, I felt like a Frankenstein\u2019s monster who has lumbered into a wedding party.

At this point, I\u2019m still waiting for my post-treatment scans, but under the weight of my doctor\u2019s caution that a recurrence is \u201cnot uncommon\u201d. People don\u2019t say \u201ccured\u201d when they talk about\u00a0cancer. The second element is people wanting to know how I found out. Their subtext is fear, doubt, the nagging feeling of inevitability. People ask that when they\u2019ve had a tiny lump under their skin or a persistent cough or something that feels wrong in their stomach. When you\u2019re younger, your body fixes things in due time. When you get older, that doesn\u2019t always happen. I\u2019m not a doctor, so I\u2019m not the person to talk about specifics.

He made a half-hearted attempt to list things it could be other than cancer. But I could tell he knew. The biopsy was almost a formality. The third part of these conversations, and the part that means the most to me, is people telling me about their own experiences. Their friends, their family, their grandparents, their parents. I\u2019m constantly surprised at how many people\u2019s lives have been affected by cancer, their own or someone else\u2019s. I am constantly surprised at how far it reaches, at how connected we all are, at the sheer commonness of this condition. I am constantly surprised at how many of us understand each other. At how normal I am. When I was diagnosed, I only thought of cancer as a disease. I didn\u2019t realize it was also a community. Then the conversation moves naturally to something else and I feel lighter. I feel an immense sense of gratitude. Toward Elise for mentioning it when Paul arrived. Toward this woman for describing me as a cancer survivor, not because it\u2019s how I think of myself, but because of the intent behind her comment. Toward the people who have moseyed into the kitchen and stuck around to join the conversation, which has now moved on to the Star Wars movie. For the opportunity to be the guy with cancer who is standing in the kitchen, laughing, holding a drink, happy. If someone showed up with a platter of fruit on his head, you wouldn\u2019t ignore it. Cancer is like that. It didn\u2019t feel odd to talk about it. On the contrary, it felt odd not to talk about it. If someone showed up with a platter of fruit on his head, you wouldn\u2019t ignore it. Cancer is like that. It is as absurd and inconvenient as a platter of fruit on top of your head. When you see it, you cannot ignore it. And if you are ignoring it, you\u2019re doing it through sheer force of will. \u201cIs that platter heavy? How long has it been there? Do you sleep with it?\u201d Those are natural questions. If you instead say, \u201cHow about the weather?\u201d to someone with a platter of fruit on his head, he will be embarrassed. He will realize you don\u2019t want to talk about it. And he won\u2019t want to talk about it, although it\u2019s a significant part of his experience. Because it is heavy. However long it\u2019s been there almost doesn\u2019t matter because it is possibly the end of time. And sleeping with it isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is waking up and remembering it all over again every day. What people may not realize is that we\u2019re used to talking about it. People with cancer talk about it a lot. With their families. With their doctors. With their friends. With their colleagues. Perhaps in support groups. Talking about it is nothing new to us. If someone has a cast on his arm, you wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask him about it. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you would ask, nodding at the cast. He\u2019s used to telling people. It makes him feel less self-conscious. At the time I didn\u2019t know why I made a point to find that guy to say good-bye before Nora and I left to give her cat an insulin shot. Now I know. Now I know what I should have said to him. Now I know what he would have wanted me to say. All illustrations by Shannon Wheeler. Like this story?
