{"name": "249", "parent": "", "content": "The Blueprint for Each Final Four Coach to Guarantee His Team a National\u00a0Title Coach Titus dishes out some of his infinite wisdom to the programs still vying to cut down the\u00a0nets I\u2019will be honest: I thought I had a legitimate shot at being named the new Duquesne head basketball coach. For the past few weeks, the Duquesne athletic department seemingly couldn\u2019t find anyone to take the job, mostly because it\u2019s as close to a career-killing gig as exists in the Division I ranks. The Dukes have posted one 20-win season (2008\u201309) in the past 35 years and haven\u2019t made an NCAA tournament since 1977. The school considers it a success when 1,500 fans show up for a home game. And virtually everyone who was supposed to play a significant role on the 2017\u201318 roster has recently transferred or decommitted. In the end, the job went to 58-year-old Keith Dambrot, alumnus and former head coach of the University of Akron who is an Akron native, has spent the past 20 years coaching in Akron, and definitely didn\u2019t take the Duquesne job just so he could make a bunch of money and promptly retire. Anyway, as the Duquesne coaching search dragged on and I appeared to be the only candidate willing to accept the job, I slowly started talking myself into my chances. The tiny corner of the internet that I occupy rallied behind me, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette endorsed me, and most importantly, at least 10 people sent me emails that were addressed to \u201cCoach Titus.\u201d Honestly, once things got to that point, it no longer mattered whether I got the job. What mattered is that strangers were calling me \u201cCoach,\u201d which is all I ever really wanted. Because as has been proved by Grant Hill calling Bill Raftery \u201cCoach,\u201d even though Raftery never accomplished anything of significance as a coach and hasn\u2019t coached since 1981, getting tagged with the \u201cCoach\u201d label is something that you carry for life. So with that, allow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m Coach Titus, and I\u2019m here to break down the Final Four. More specifically, I\u2019m here to explain how I\u2019d approach each coaching situation for the teams still vying for the title. South Carolina Motivational angle: South Carolina, the no. 7 seed in the East region, is the closest thing the 2017 Final Four has to a Cinderella. If I\u2019m Frank Martin, I tap into that as much as I can. I\u2019d go all in with the \u201cnobody believes in us\u201d trope, and I\u2019d sprinkle in some \u201cwe have nothing to lose because we\u2019re not even supposed to be here\u201d messaging to keep the team loose. The one thing I\u2019d be careful to avoid is telling the players that everyone thinks they suck too much, as that runs the risk of guys shifting their mind-set from \u201clet\u2019s prove them wrong!\u201d to \u201cmaybe everyone is right and we really aren\u2019t that good.\u201d Considering that the Gamecocks weren\u2019t supposed to win any of their past three games, I\u2019m confident Martin long ago figured out how to strike the right balance. Biggest off-court challenge: South Carolina is the media darling of this Final Four, which is great in the sense that America is learning all sorts of cool things about the Gamecocks. For instance: Did you know there\u2019s more to Frank Martin than him just losing his goddamn mind every so often, and that he\u2019s actually a real person who had a real life before becoming Kansas State\u2019s head coach in 2007? I know. I couldn\u2019t believe it either. Sindarius Thornwell (Getty\u00a0Images) The downside to getting all this publicity, though, is that it can sometimes become a distraction. As someone who has been on the bench for a Final Four, Coach Titus knows the issues that Martin is facing. The lead-up to Saturday is absolute chaos: There\u2019s the multitude of media requests; the dinner, banquet, and ring-sizing procedures; the practicing in different environments; and the fans waiting in the lobby to kiss your ass and tell you how great you are every time you enter or leave the hotel. It\u2019s hard enough for Final Four teams to navigate everything and remain focused on the game. Now, on top of that, Martin has to convince his guys to stay locked in and disregard how he told America that he basically stalked his wife. Then again, there isn\u2019t a ton of strategy that South Carolina needs to worry about, since nothing about Gonzaga\u2019s system is unique. In that regard, Coach Titus would let the players enjoy this week as much as possible. My only demand would be a couple of film sessions where we would discuss little things like how often we should double-team Przemek Karnowski and whether Zach Collins looks like T.J. McConnell. Biggest strategic decision: Sindarius Thornwell is the best player remaining in this tournament and the only reliable source of offense that South Carolina has, so I\u2019d expect Gonzaga to do all it can to take Thornwell out of Saturday\u2019s game. The Zags are great defensively and seem unlikely to turn to a junk zone (like a triangle-and-2 or a box-and-1), but they might throw double-teams at Thornwell, or at the very least pack the paint when he catches the ball to ensure that a ton of help is always nearby. Knowing this, Martin should make two things clear to his team: (1) Thornwell can\u2019t fall into Gonzaga\u2019s trap and force things because he thinks he has to do all the scoring, and (2) someone else on South Carolina\u200a\u2014\u200amost likely point guard PJ Dozier, who should have a size advantage no matter who is matched up with him\u200a\u2014\u200ahas to step up and have a monster game. Frank Martin Is So Mad That South Carolina Made the Final FourMartin may look like the maddest man on the planet, but his players say they love him, and his teams play some of the\u2026theringer.com Gonzaga Motivational angle: Most of the talk surrounding Gonzaga concerns how the program finally broke through and made its first Final Four after almost two decades of building a (completely ridiculous and inaccurate) reputation as a choker in March. This would worry me a bit if I were Mark Few. Regardless of what the Zags\u2019 history might suggest, this team is no Cinderella, and it would be a shame to pretend like it\u2019s reached the top of the mountain when there are two more games to be won. Still, this has been a magical year for Gonzaga, which has a real chance to become the first mid-major to win a national championship since UNLV in 1990. Taking all of this into account, Coach Titus would give a pregame speech that blends the \u201cwe still have work to do\u201d sentiment with a little \u201cbe sure to soak this all in because you\u2019ll forever be a part of history\u201d talk. In other words, a hybrid of Jake Taylor from Major League and Merle from Hoosiers: \u201cWell, I guess there\u2019s only one thing left to do. Let\u2019s go win the whole fucking thing for all the small schools that never had a chance to get here.\u201d Biggest off-court challenge: I\u2019m not saying that Gonzaga faces a ton of pressure to win the title. I\u2019m just saying that ESPN\u2019s Dana O\u2019Neil wrote an article on Wednesday that made the case the entire university was saved by Few\u2019s program. Just think about that for a second. The big North Carolina story right now is that Luke Maye went to class at 8 a.m. the morning after hitting the game winner to beat Kentucky. The South Carolina story is that Frank Martin is an actual human being. The Oregon story is, well, we\u2019ll get to that in a second. The Gonzaga story is, \u201cHey, congrats on your first Final Four! Did you know that the entire economy of Eastern Washington is counting on you guys to not screw this up? Welp, good luck!\u201d Przemek Karnowski (Getty\u00a0Images) I doubt that Gonzaga\u2019s players are even aware that the Bulldogs teams of the early 2000s kept the university from going under, but it\u2019s clear that no college basketball team means as much to its local community as the Zags. That\u2019s why I\u2019m guessing fans have had mixed emotions all week, alternating between celebrating the Final Four and being nervous as balls that Gonzaga is going to blow it and everyone will revert to saying this team is overrated and never played anybody. Coach Titus would address this by reminding the players that the program and university will be in good shape moving forward no matter what happens this weekend, and that they have nothing to be nervous about because they\u2019re the best team left in the field. Biggest strategic decision: South Carolina\u2019s defense, which is essentially what you\u2019d get if you condensed West Virginia\u2019s press into a half-court format, could pose problems for a Gonzaga team that struggled with turnovers in its Sweet 16 win over the Mountaineers. But there\u2019s nothing Few can do about that. The Zags will run the same stuff they have all year, and it will be up to the players to avoid panicking and be strong with the ball. That\u2019s why I think the real strategy will come on the other end of the floor, where Few will have to decide how many defenders he wants to throw at Thornwell. Coach Titus would just play Thornwell straight up to start, pack the paint on the weak side and offer aggressive help, and live with giving up some open 3-point looks to guys not named Thornwell. Thornwell is 11-of-26 from deep in the tourney; South Carolina\u2019s other players are a combined 14-of-50. The Three Most Important Matchups to Watch in Each Final Four GameHow will Gonzaga defend the SEC Player of the Year? How will Oregon handle the ACC Player of the Year?theringer.com Oregon Motivational angle: Remember when I said we\u2019d get to the big Oregon story in a second? Well, here\u2019s the thing: There doesn\u2019t seem to be one. Maybe I\u2019m just looking in the wrong places, but I\u2019m pretty sure the Ducks are the most underrepresented Final Four team in terms of media coverage. That may be a product of East Coast bias, of people assuming that North Carolina is going to steamroll them, or of the notion that there\u2019s just nothing about Oregon that\u2019s as interesting as Frank Martin, Luke Maye, or a Cinderella blossoming into a juggernaut. Whatever the case, Coach Titus would bring this up all week and utilize a cousin of the \u201cnobody believes in us\u201d approach by going with the \u201cthey don\u2019t want you here\u201d speech. I might even take things one step further and convince my team that the NCAA has devised a conspiracy to make North Carolina meet Gonzaga in the title game \u201cfor ratings,\u201d and that the only way we can stop it is by leaving no doubt that we\u2019re the better team on Saturday. Dillon Brooks (Getty\u00a0Images) Biggest off-court challenge: If there are stories surrounding Oregon this week, they likely have to do with shooting guard Tyler Dorsey and forward Jordan Bell comprising one hell of an NBA Jam duo throughout this tournament. This is obviously great news for the Ducks. It\u2019s just that the explosion of those two guys comes at an interesting time, as on Tuesday Pac-12 Player of the Year Dillon Brooks was named an AP second-team All-American. The concern for Dana Altman is that a power struggle might unfold against North Carolina, where Brooks forces the action in an attempt to reclaim his throne as Oregon\u2019s alpha dog. And no, I don\u2019t have reason to believe that Brooks is petty enough to worry about bullshit like that when a national title is on the line. But it\u2019s human nature to have some ego, and Brooks might feel like he has to carry the team anyway, as he figures to be matched up with a Carolina big all game, while Dorsey could have Justin Jackson, who is four inches taller than he is, draped all over him. Coach Titus would handle this by going to one of the oldest moves in the coaching playbook: I\u2019d tell Brooks to stay patient and take what comes to him, because even if he ends up with mediocre stats, I can always just \u201cmake some calls to the NBA\u201d to take care of his draft stock. Biggest strategic decision: Oregon is in a bind defensively given that the Ducks really have only two serviceable big men while North Carolina has somewhere in the neighborhood of a shit ton. If the Ducks play straight-up man-to-man, they\u2019ll be stuck with Brooks having to guard Isaiah Hicks, a matchup that would likely go poorly for them. But if Oregon goes to a zone (or to a switching man-to-man, which is basically a zone) and dares Carolina to make 3s, it becomes susceptible to giving up offensive rebounds to the best rebounding team in the country. This is truly a terrible matchup for a Ducks defense that has been pretty good all season. Coach Titus would regularly switch things up, try to disrupt Carolina\u2019s rhythm, and hope that the players score enough on the other end to pull out a win. Oregon\u2019s Tyler Dorsey Has Turned the NCAA Tournament Into a Video GameCan he keep setting the nets on fire for two more games?theringer.com North Carolina Motivational angle: It\u2019s going to be difficult for Roy Williams to play the underdog card with this group, seeing as North Carolina is a no. 1 seed, the Vegas favorite to win the championship, and a team that\u2019s been ranked in the top 10 of the AP poll for most of the season. But he does have an ace up his sleeve with the Kris Jenkins shot that sunk the Heels in last year\u2019s title game. Coach Titus would harp on that as much as possible and throw in some shit about how \u201cwe have unfinished business\u201d and how \u201call these other teams are just happy to be here.\u201d That\u2019s really the only approach to take in this situation. The other programs can all convince themselves that they\u2019re Cinderellas to some degree, and that they have nothing to lose in the Final Four. North Carolina should go in the opposite direction, become pissed off and businesslike, and try to crush its opponents in the next two games so badly that the NCAA will retroactively give the program the 2016 title, too. Joel Berry II (Getty\u00a0Images) Biggest off-court challenge: Carolina\u2019s system is a machine that, when running properly, doesn\u2019t have to rely on any one player like many other offenses around the country do. The paradox to it is that the only way the machine can run properly is if the point guard\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, Joel Berry II\u200a\u2014\u200apushes the tempo, gets the ball where it needs to be, and picks spots to chase his own points. The problem is that Berry\u2019s health for Saturday\u2019s game is in question because he\u2019s currently nursing two sprained ankles, which, if my math checks out, leaves him with zero good ones. And while North Carolina\u2019s massive size advantage over Oregon could help the Tar Heels overcome an ineffective Berry on Saturday, the same can\u2019t be said about a potential national championship matchup against either Gonzaga or South Carolina. Coach Titus\u2019s top priority would be giving Berry ice packs, hot tubs, PEDs, Robitussin, Icy Hot, Bojangles\u2019, fake classes, and anything else he needs to get back to 100 percent. Biggest strategic decision: I wrote on Monday about how I expect Luke Maye, North Carolina\u2019s hero against Kentucky, to stay in the spotlight in the Final Four, mostly because I expect Oregon to play a lot of zone against the Heels and because Maye is the perfect high-post zonebuster on North Carolina\u2019s roster. But here\u2019s the inconvenient truth: Maye is ninth on the team in minutes for a reason, and that\u2019s because he is a defensive liability. This is worrisome because Maye figures to play a significant chunk of minutes on Saturday and might have to guard Dillon Brooks in stretches, a hypothetical that would give me night sweats if I were a North Carolina fan. You can live with all of this if Maye is continuing his offensive hot streak, but what happens if he goes cold? And how many freebie misses is Williams going to give him? If you bench Maye after he misses one shot, you could prematurely stifle the South region\u2019s Most Outstanding Player and the hottest hand on your team. But if Maye loses the magic touch and you leave him on the floor in hopes that he rediscovers it, you\u2019ve put yourself in a position where you\u2019re trusting a bad defender who isn\u2019t scoring. In other words, Williams just might have the Spike Albrecht Conundrum on his hands, a situation that even an advanced basketball mind like Coach Titus isn\u2019t sure how to handle. I can tell you this, though: I\u2019ll know for certain what Roy should have done after Saturday\u2019s game is over. Hindsight armchair coaching is where Coach Titus truly excels.

But if Oregon goes to a zone (or to a switching man-to-man, which is basically a zone) and dares Carolina to make 3s, it becomes susceptible to giving up offensive rebounds to the best rebounding team in the country. This is truly a terrible matchup for a Ducks defense that has been pretty good all season. Coach Titus would regularly switch things up, try to disrupt Carolina\u2019s rhythm, and hope that the players score enough on the other end to pull out a win."}, {"cc41": "Oregon\u2019s Tyler Dorsey Has Turned the NCAA Tournament Into a Video GameCan he keep setting the nets on fire for two more games?theringer.com"}, {"52ff": "North Carolina"}, {"4fcf": "Motivational angle: It\u2019s going to be difficult for Roy Williams to play the underdog card with this group, seeing as North Carolina is a no. 1 seed, the Vegas favorite to win the championship, and a team that\u2019s been ranked in the top 10 of the AP poll for most of the season. But he does have an ace up his sleeve with the Kris Jenkins shot that sunk the Heels in last year\u2019s title game. Coach Titus would harp on that as much as possible and throw in some shit about how \u201cwe have unfinished business\u201d and how \u201call these other teams are just happy to be here.\u201d That\u2019s really the only approach to take in this situation. The other programs can all convince themselves that they\u2019re Cinderellas to some degree, and that they have nothing to lose in the Final Four. North Carolina should go in the opposite direction, become pissed off and businesslike, and try to crush its opponents in the next two games so badly that the NCAA will retroactively give the program the 2016 title, too."}, {"e6ca": "Joel Berry II (Getty\u00a0Images)"}, {"811c": "Biggest off-court challenge: Carolina\u2019s system is a machine that, when running properly, doesn\u2019t have to rely on any one player like many other offenses around the country do. The paradox to it is that the only way the machine can run properly is if the point guard\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, Joel Berry II\u200a\u2014\u200apushes the tempo, gets the ball where it needs to be, and picks spots to chase his own points. The problem is that Berry\u2019s health for Saturday\u2019s game is in question because he\u2019s currently nursing two sprained ankles, which, if my math checks out, leaves him with zero good ones. And while North Carolina\u2019s massive size advantage over Oregon could help the Tar Heels overcome an ineffective Berry on Saturday, the same can\u2019t be said about a potential national championship matchup against either Gonzaga or South Carolina. Coach Titus\u2019s top priority would be giving Berry ice packs, hot tubs, PEDs, Robitussin, Icy Hot, Bojangles\u2019, fake classes, and anything else he needs to get back to 100 percent."}, {"ed5f": "Biggest strategic decision: I wrote on Monday about how I expect Luke Maye, North Carolina\u2019s hero against Kentucky, to stay in the spotlight in the Final Four, mostly because I expect Oregon to play a lot of zone against the Heels and because Maye is the perfect high-post zonebuster on North Carolina\u2019s roster. But here\u2019s the inconvenient truth: Maye is ninth on the team in minutes for a reason, and that\u2019s because he is a defensive liability. This is worrisome because Maye figures to play a significant chunk of minutes on Saturday and might have to guard Dillon Brooks in stretches, a hypothetical that would give me night sweats if I were a North Carolina fan."}, {"edb1": "You can live with all of this if Maye is continuing his offensive hot streak, but what happens if he goes cold? And how many freebie misses is Williams going to give him? If you bench Maye after he misses one shot, you could prematurely stifle the South region\u2019s Most Outstanding Player and the hottest hand on your team. But if Maye loses the magic touch and you leave him on the floor in hopes that he rediscovers it, you\u2019ve put yourself in a position where you\u2019re trusting a bad defender who isn\u2019t scoring. In other words, Williams just might have the Spike Albrecht Conundrum on his hands, a situation that even an advanced basketball mind like Coach Titus isn\u2019t sure how to handle."}, {"afd7": "I can tell you this, though: I\u2019ll know for certain what Roy should have done after Saturday\u2019s game is over.
