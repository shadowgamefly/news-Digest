But what\u2019s a guy to do when you can\u2019t get fired for telling a room full of journalists that Hitler didn\u2019t gas \u201chis own people\u201d? Answer: you have to get creative. Despite our differences, everyone can relate to being stuck in a terrible job, so we want to help Sean Spicer. Here are nine sure-fire ways for the Press Secretary to make a dramatic exit and start a new life somewhere out of the spotlight (or on Fox & Friends, whichever). 1. The Mary\u00a0Poppins Pull a giant umbrella from your giant suit and float away. 2. Chocolate Revenge Make reporters watch you eat an entire chocolate cake on the podium. Offer some to Glenn Thrush then say \u201cPSYCH, BITCH\u201d and finish cake in one bite. 3. The Differential Bring out a stack of papers. Explain that you are BIGGER and the stack of papers is SMALLER\u2026 look around the room meaningfully, leave. 4.

When someone finally asks why you\u2019re taking questions from a rat, gasp and say, \u201cYou see him, too?\u201d Run. 6. The\u00a0Up Tie 100 balloons to podium, fly away. 7. Reverse\u00a0Stripper Yell \u201cSURPRISE!\u201d, get inside a giant cake and wait until someone wheels you out of the room. 8. Three Words: Carrie Prom\u00a0Scene 9.
