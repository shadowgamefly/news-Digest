{"name": "1224", "parent": "", "content": "I Made Friends In Spite of\u00a0Myself I was an introvert before it was cool. I was an introvert back when people thought introversion and shyness were the same thing. My teacher called my mom for a meeting when I was in third grade. She said I was too serious. I should learn to relax and play more with the other kids. I had one best friend and was totally happy spending every recess just the two of us. I\u2019m also INTJ. The introvert\u2019s introvert. We believe everything can be analyzed. Part of our introversion comes from the fact that people are hard. They\u2019re squidgy organic bits with FEELINGS that I can\u2019t reason out. When they won\u2019t let me help them fix their feelings, we\u2019re both left frustrated: me because I can\u2019t solve the problem, them because I won\u2019t listen to them talk about their feelings more. I like being at home. I spend all day interacting with colleagues in my day job. I married an extrovert and he makes me do stuff like talk to people and go places. That\u2019s enough for me. For the longest time, I thought my social circle of non-family members and non-coworkers was a circle of zero, and I was cool with that. But then something happened. I made friends. Making friends once you\u2019re out of school is hard. It\u2019s even harder when you move away to a new city. Not having a pre-packaged group of people of a similar age and with similar life experiences means you have to work at friendships. You have to engage. Make small talk. Hang out. Get to know each other. Believe you have something to offer that makes you interesting. My introvert heart shudders just typing those things out. Imagine trying to do them. It took me ten years to make new friends. First they were people my husband knew. We\u2019d go to birthday parties, and then they\u2019d invite us over for drinks or board games. It was weird. Suddenly we were friends. They didn\u2019t follow all those friend-making steps I listed above. They just decided we were going to be friends. It was just like the White Stripes said it would be. I know I sound like the worst kind of Sheldon Cooper wannabe right now. In a second I\u2019ll be offering you all a warm beverage, but that\u2019s how I saw it. And it\u2019s not like I spent all my time wondering how this could happen. I\u2019m not a robot. If it doesn\u2019t compute, but these new friends are willing to stay up late playing Killer Bunnies or Settlers of Catan, I\u2019m going to roll with it. Those friends didn\u2019t really stick though. Once they started having kids, late night board game marathons went away. The thing about being a homebody, though, is you\u2019ve got time to fill. If there aren\u2019t kids in the picture, and you\u2019re not up late plotting Meeple demise in Carcasonne, there\u2019s time. Plus, my extrovert husband works a lot of evenings shifts. So I started looking for things to do. At first, I was all over the map. I volunteered with the city\u2019s environmental corps. I took yoga. I tried to start a blog (three times). I got certified to teach fitness classes. I learned the practice of movement art therapy. I went back to creative writing after years away from it. It was writing where the friendships happened. Probably because it attracts a lot of introverts. It was slow at first. We met in formal classes. Then we started having dates in coffee shops to work on our individual projects; introverts alone together typing silently away. I enjoyed writing so much I was willing overlook the need for *shudder* small talk in those dates. And if the silences started to stretch, I could always resort to \u201cso how\u2019s your writing going?\u201d It must have worked, because then those writer friends started inviting me to do other things. Community theatre. More birthday parties. Concerts. And doing those things meant I met more people who invited me to more things. At first it was weird, just like it had been before. Me? You\u2019re asking me? We barely know each other. But they kept asking. And sometimes they went out of their way to ask. It was weird and flattering. My INTJ heart still doesn\u2019t understand it, but I\u2019m trying not to over-analyze the gift horse\u2019s mouth, as it were. Am I ever going to be the friend these people call in the middle of the night when their kids are driving them crazy, or they lost their job? Maybe. But I\u2019ll always going be the friend who wants to fix things, and not just listen, and that\u2019s maybe not what they\u2019re looking for. Being someone\u2019s shoulder to cry on will always be an awkward fit. Sheldon and I have that in common at least, but you can have my spot on the couch if you want it. I\u2019ll be a great friend when you want to start planning your career change though, or just if you need a buddy to try out that new Korean BBQ place downtown. I\u2019ll come to your parties, as long as you don\u2019t mind me gravitating to the other introverts on the couch, and I\u2019ll schedule our writing dates with enthusiastic efficiency. Adulthood is weird. Making friends is weirder. It\u2019s kind of nice though. Nice to have people who like the same stuff you do, and who look forward to seeing you again. Maybe Jack White was right after all. Allison Temple is an introvert and a romance writer. Don\u2019t be shy about clicking that little green heart if you liked this article.
