Scott Applewhite By Josh Israel and Ryan Koronowski Not that long ago, it was November 2013. The Republican minority in the U.S. Senate had been mounting an unprecedented blockade of President Obama\u2019s nominees for judgeships and executive branch positions. Key positions were being left unfilled. Senate Majority Harry Reid (D-NV) took to the Senate floor and moved to change the rules eliminate the filibuster for most appointments. The rules change\u200a\u2014\u200aknown as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d because of the explosive impact it was expected to have on the Senate\u200a\u2014\u200ascrapped the requirement that ending debate on executive branch and lower court appointees took three-fifths of the Senate (60 votes) and replaced it with a simple majority (51 votes) threshold. At the time, the Republican minority denounced the move as an erosion of minority rights, a naked power grab, and a violation of the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty. They pointed out that many of the same Democrats had fiercely fought a similar move 8 years earlier in support of George W. Bush\u2019s nominees. But their biggest gripe was that the rule change was done by a majority vote; they pointed to a provision in Rule XXII that indicated rules changes require a two-thirds super-majority. Democrats argued that this rule was not applicable, but Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and many of his GOP colleagues howled that Reid had decided to \u201cbreak the rules to change the rules.\u201d Watch: This week, after at least 41 Senate Democrats announced they plan to oppose cloture on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, McConnell and his Republican colleagues made it clear that they would now use the maneuver they for years have claimed they cannot do under Senate rules to allow them to seat Trump\u2019s pick on the high court with just a simple majority. In other words: McConnell now plans to \u201cbreak the rules to change the rules.\u201d But McConnell was not alone in deriding the maneuver. A ThinkProgress review of members\u2019 comments from 2013 onward found that at least 34 of the 37 current Republican senators who were serving at the time denounced the \u201cnuclear option\u201d as forbidden and a dangerous power grab. Today, Democrats opposing the nuclear option for Supreme Court nominees are not arguing that Senate rules prevent it from happening. And while a reasonable case can be made that Supreme Court nominees, like appointees, should not be subject to the filibuster, what is stunning here is the number of Senators willing to do something that just four years ago they said could and should not be done, because it is politically expeditious now. They include (emphasis added): \u201cLet\u2019s imagine this: The Vanderbilt-Tennessee game, which is being\u00a0played in Knoxville, home of the University of Tennessee, and\u00a0Vanderbilt gets on the 1-yard line. The University of Tennessee says:\u00a0Well, we are the home team, so we will just add 20 yards to the field\u00a0or whatever it takes for us to win the game. Or the Boston Red Sox are\u00a0playing at home. Let\u2019s say they are behind the Cardinals this year.\u00a0They get to the ninth inning and they are behind and they say: Well, it\u00a0is our home field. We will just add a few innings or whatever it takes\u00a0so we can win the game. That is what the Democratic majority did today.\u00a0They say: The rules don\u2019t allow us to do what we want to do, so we will\u00a0just change the rules to do whatever it takes to get the result we\u00a0want.\u201d 2. John Barrasso (R-WY) \u201cWe are not wiser than the Founding Fathers. It is not time to throw out the rules.\u00a0\u2026 Senate Democrats should remember\u200a\u2014\u200ashould remember\u200a\u2014\u200atheir prior commitments and abandon this plan before irreparably damaging the Senate.\u201d 3. Roy Blunt (R-MO) \u201cThis power grab by Leader Reid and Senate Democrats is simply an attempt to shift the focus away from the disastrous Obamacare roll-out. The Democrats decided all on their own to involve the government in every American\u2019s health care. Now, the Democrats want to make decisions all on their own about every federal judge. Neither of these things will produce a result the American people deserve.\u201d 4. John Boozman (R-AR) \u201cThis was an act of desperation by the Senate Majority to distract from a disastrous few weeks. Senator Reid\u2019s willingness to break the rules to change the rules so he could divert attention from Obamacare\u2019s failures is understandable given how disastrous the program\u2019s rollout has been.\u201d 5. Richard Burr (R-NC) \u201cThe American people know what they get when the Senate removes the 60-vote threshold and the minority is stripped of its rights: they get unchecked power by the Executive Branch. The President and Harry Reid might not like the American people playing a role in outcomes through the minority, but it has worked well for over 200 years. This change is a blatant attempt to change the debate about the Democrats\u2019 health care plan as the consequences of this disastrous law are felt around the country, but it has ramifications far beyond the debate surrounding Obamacare. Rather than advance legislation and nominate judges that are capable of receiving bipartisan support in the United States Senate, the President and the Democrat majority want their legislation, their way\u200a\u2014\u200aand they want to change the Senate rules to pack the courts with judges who agree with them. Make no mistake; these actions pave the way for more laws like Obamacare and will do lasting damage to bipartisanship, the Senate, and the nation.\u201d 6. Thad Cochran (R-MS) \u201cMadam President, as the majority contemplate changing the rules of the Senate to expedite the confirmation of several executive branch nominees, I hope that serious consideration was given to the adverse effects this change could have. We should resist embarking on a path that would circumvent the rights of the minority to exercise its advice and consent responsibilities provided in the Constitution. The consequences of the action by the majority should not be minimized. Former Senator Ted Kennedy, in 2003, testified before the Rules Committee that by allowing a simple majority to end debate on nominees, the Senate would put itself on a course to destroy the very essence of our constitutional role.\u2019 Such a departure from precedent would dilute the minority rights that differentiate the Senate from the other body. It also opens the door to applying this same rule to debate on judicial nominations, as well as the legislative process.\u201d 7. Susan Collins (R-ME) \u201cIn 2005, I strongly opposed a Republican plan to employ the so-called \u2018nuclear option.\u2019 I was deeply concerned that, by adopting changes in the standing rules by a simple majority, party-line vote, the majority party would have had unprecedented power to limit debate and block Senators from offering amendments. Today, I feel just as strongly about Democratic Leader Harry Reid\u2019s move to stifle debate and exclude amendments from members, no matter on which side of the aisle they serve. That impedes careful consideration of the most important matters before Congress and is not in our country\u2019s best interests.\u201d 8. Bob Corker (R-TN) \u201cAt some point, you have to just throw up your hands and say, look, they\u2019re going to use brute, raw force to get what they wish. Let\u2019s face it. I mean, this is about the D.C. Circuit.\u201d 9. John Cornyn (R-TX) \u201c[The Democrats] will do anything to take the attention off the failure that is Obamacare, even if it means breaking the rules of the Senate in a raw exercise of partisan political power.\u201d 10. Mike Crapo (R-ID) \u201cThis week in the Senate, we have had a very intense battle over the filibuster rules. It has become named the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 battle, relating to a threat by Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, to essentially break the rules to change the rules and force through a number of executive nominations.\u00a0\u2026 in order to change the rule, it takes 67 votes.\u201d 11. Ted Cruz (R-TX) \u201cToday\u2019s unfortunate vote damaged the Senate and was designed to try to change the topic from the millions of Americans losing their jobs and their healthcare because of Obamacare... [I]n yet another partisan abuse of power, the Democrats are now shamelessly working to pack the D.C. Circuit, so that President Obama\u2019s lawless disregard of our statutes and Constitution will not be held to account by an impartial judiciary.\u201d 12. Mike Enzi (R-WY) \u201cIf members of the majority in the Senate use the nuclear option to weaken the filibuster, they weaken the Senate itself. A weak Senate is more susceptible to the demands of a smaller majority and the president\u2026 So much for the rights of the minority inherent in the rules of the Senate. What they are considering would be incredibly short-sighted.\u201d 13. Deb Fischer (R-NE) \u201cSome of my colleagues are working to change the rules of the Senate by diluting the power of the filibuster. Nebraskans know that the filibuster ensures that the views of the minority are heard; many have called my office to express this opinion. While I agree that the Senate must become more functional, I do not believe the solution is to destroy the very character of the institution, which was purposefully designed by our Founding Fathers. When the Constitution was drafted, Thomas Jefferson was overseas serving as an ambassador. After he returned, Jefferson questioned George Washington about the role of the Senate. In response, Washington posed a question: \u2018Why did you pour that tea into your saucer,\u2019 he asked. \u2018To cool it,\u2019 said Jefferson. \u2018Even so we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it,\u2019 concluded Washington. The Senate, then, was designed as a deliberative body to produce thoughtful policy. The solution to Senate gridlock is not changing the rules, or shattering the \u2018cooling saucer.\u2019\u201d 14. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in the Senate when Democrats are willing to ignore 225 years of precedent to distract attention away from the failures of Obamacare.\u201d 15. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it was\u200a\u2014\u200aa raw power grab by Senate Democrats and President Obama. Previous efforts to resist the temptation of turning the Senate into the House of Representatives were lost today and the \u2018advise and consent\u2019 clause for executive and judicial branch nominations was washed away.\u00a0... Without the ability to delay nominations, presidential administrations are likely to be even more successful in their stonewalling efforts. Finally, one of the great concerns about this rule change is without the requirement to work with the minority party to select judges, the judiciary will become dominated by ideologues. One of the biggest winners of this move is liberal groups who will be pushing radical, liberal judges to serve on the federal bench.\u201d 16. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) \u201cThis is about a naked power grab and nothing more than a power grab. This is about the other side not getting everything they want, when they want it.\u00a0\u2026 But make no mistake, my friends on the other side will have to answer this question: Why did you choose this moment to break the rules to change the rules?\u2026 [W]hy did you choose this moment to hand the keys to the kingdom over to the President, a President with less check on his authority?\u201d 17. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) \u201cIt is a pre-scripted parliamentary hit-and-run, over in a flash andleaving Senate tradition and practice behind like so much confirmation roadkill. This would be the wrong way to address even a real confirmation crisis, let alone the fake one created by the majority today. The majority, it seems, just does not like the way our system of government is designed to work.\u00a0\u2026 They are denying to others the very same tools that they used so aggressively before.\u00a0\u2026 They have fundamentally altered this body, they have in the most disingenuous way done long term institutional damage for short term political gain.\u201d 18. Dean Heller (R-NV) \u201cThis is a sad day for the United States Senate, and a scary day for Nevada. While today we are discussing nominations, what assurances are there that today\u2019s changes will not apply to future legislation? The Nevada delegation has prevented Yucca Mountain from moving forward, a policy that is already the law of the land. We have been able to accomplish this using every arrow in our quiver. When you are from a small state, you have to rely on every tool in your toolbox to protect yourself. Now, the opening of Yucca Mountain is a renewed risk. It\u2019s clear that today\u2019s actions by the Senate have made Nevada even more vulnerable to the will of the majority.\u201d 19. John Hoeven (R-ND) \u201cYou asked what we could do when we get control. I\u2019m saying we\u2019re going to think through that in a very measured way and come up with something that works for the American people and get some good results. Not a partisan unilateral action\u2026 I think Robert Byrd who was in the Senate for, you know, one of the longest serving senators in the history of the Senate, I think he is turning over in his grave. I mean, he was somebody who understood to break the rules means you have no rules.\u201d 20. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) \u201cFor 100 years, the Senate has had a rule in place to protect the minority voice by requiring a supermajority for highly debated issue. Reid\u2019s \u2018nuclear option\u2019 yesterday overturned this rule when it applies to consideration of most presidential nominees. By removing the minority\u2019s voice in this procedure, Senate Democrats essentially made the Senate\u2019s constitutional role to advise and consent on nominations merely ceremonial.\u201d 21. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) \u201cAnd what you do by changing the rules of the Senate and taking away that ability to be thoughtful and deliberate is, you end up with a Senate that can be a runaway Senate as much as you can have a House that\u2019s a runaway House. And that\u2019s not good for the country.\u00a0\u2026 I think you need to be where you are where you\u2019re in the majority as well as the minority. If we think something\u2019s wrong when they\u2019re in the majority and based on principle it also ought to be wrong when we\u2019re in the majority.\u201d 22. Ron Johnson (R-WI) \u201cThe rules are being changed in the middle of the game. They\u2019re breaking the rules to change the rules, regardless of one\u2019s political affiliations, Americans understand this is a political power grab\u200a\u2014\u200aa partisan political grab.\u201d 23. Mike Lee (R-UT) \u201cMuch like the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 change to Senate rules in November, Reid\u2019s refusal to allow amendments to the NDAA this year serves no other purpose than to stymie the rights of the American people to have their voices heard on important legislation through their elected officials.\u201d 24. John McCain (R-AZ) \u201cI feel this is a dark day for the Senate. I don\u2019t know how we can get out of it. It is the biggest rules change\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly since I have been in the Senate, maybe my lifetime, and maybe in the history of the Senate\u200a\u2014\u200awhere it has changed by a simple majority by overruling the Chair\u2026. Senator Reid says: I appeal the ruling of the Chair. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to overrule the rules of the Senate, by a simple majority vote, to overrule the Parliamentarian and the Presiding Officer of the Senate. This is what happened. When our rules say to change the rules of the Senate, it takes a two-thirds vote.\" 25. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) \u201cIf you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and the American people to make advice and consent, in effect, mean nothing\u200a\u2014\u200aobviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that.\u201d 26. Jerry Moran (R-KS) \u201cSenate Democrats are breaking the rules of the Senate so they can continue to invoke the same procedural tactics they used when Obamacare was forced through Congress without a single Republican vote.\u201d 27. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) \u201cIt\u2019s a power grab, plain and simple.\u00a0\u2026 Today\u2019s vote saddens me more than it angers me. This is a sad day for the institution of the U.S. Senate, the legislative body designed to guard the views and the voices of the minority and to be\u200a\u2014\u200ain the words of George Washington\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u2018saucer used to cool the tea.\u2019 Senate Democrats have shattered that saucer into pieces. I\u2019m afraid today\u2019s rules change will fundamentally alter our operations and lead us to being a less tempered body.\u201d 28. Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cBut what he\u2019s saying is, \u2018I\u2019m in charge here, I\u2019m a bully, and I\u2019m going to get my way or I\u2019m going to change the rules.\u2019 And he had to actually break the rules in order to change the rules. Never been done. He\u2019s breaking with hundreds of years of precedent to do this. Frankly, in doing so, he\u2019s causing more discord and disharmony here, and there will be more dysfunction, I think, because of it.\u201d 29. Jim Risch (R-ID) \u201cOur founding fathers engineered a government where it was not easy to move legislation forward. These difficulties were designed to ensure differences were recognized and compromises would be necessary. This design makes us stronger, not weaker. Unfortunately, Senator Reid and his colleagues believe the ends justify the means and are willing to sacrifice our constitutional traditions in pursuit of expediency. While these changes, which took place today in the United States Senate, apply only to judicial and executive nominations, I believe going forward that Senator Reid will attempt to apply this to all legislative business of the Senate. Today\u2019s rule changes will have far ranging implications for the United States Senate and our democracy. \u201c 30. Pat Roberts (R-KS) \u201cOur rules have always ensured a voice for the minority in this body. Unlike the House, where I served, where a simple majority has the power to impose a rule change at any time, in the Senate the minority has always been protected. Here, the rules protect the minority and cannot be changed without their consent\u200a\u2014\u200aunless, of course, the majority decides it wants to break the rules to change the rules. I am saddened that is what happened today.\u201d 31. Tim Scott (R-SC) \u201cThis unprecedented power grab to change the rules of the Senate simply to try and shift people\u2019s attention away from the disastrous Obamacare rollout is short sighted, and it carries implications Democrats are going to have to live with when Republicans retake the Senate.\u201d 32. Richard Shelby (R-AL) \u201cIf Democrats think that they deserve more power, they should earn it from voters at the polls in 2014, not swipe it with a drastic rule change in the Senate today.\u201d 33. John Thune (R-SD)\u201cSenate Democrats are desperate to talk about anything other than the disastrous train wreck of ObamaCare, and are willing to break the rules of the Senate to do so.\u201d 34. Roger Wicker (R-MS) \u201cThe raw abuse of power being displayed by Senate Democrats is reminiscent of their purely partisan efforts to pass Obamacare four years ago. Further, they have tarnished the integrity of the institution by ignoring 225 years of precedent and trampling the rights of the minority party and the millions of Americans we represent. The Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be the most deliberative legislative body the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, actions taken today by the majority party have upended the chamber\u2019s tradition of thoughtful and reasoned legislating.\u201d Of course, some of these Senators who were fervently against the nuclear option for lower court judges in 2013 had actually been in support of the same maneuver in 2005\u200a\u2014\u200abut now they have completed a full 360 on the matter. One other then-Senator also proclaimed it a \u201csad day\u201d when the majority engaged in \u201cthe greatest alteration of the rules without proper procedure that we have probably seen in the history of the Republic.\u201d He is now Donald Trump\u2019s Attorney General.
