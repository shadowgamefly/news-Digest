The Winner Russell Westbrook\u2019s wrists and their impending arthritis are the clear winner here as he will finally be joined by another shooter in McDermott. Before the season and after KD\u2019s departure, what OKC needed most\u200a\u2014\u200aother than some Mediterranean Mint Talenti and Adele\u2019s 25, perhaps\u200a\u2014\u200awas scoring support. Acquiring Victor Oladipo last offseason was exciting (and he\u2019s shooting the best percentages of his career) but not enough. The Thunder\u2019s offense collapses the second Westbrook steps off the court. With Russ playing, Oklahoma City scores 106.6 points per 100 possessions; when he sits, that plummets to 97.2. In 24.5 minutes per game with the Bulls this season, Dougie McBuckets is averaging 10.2 points with an effective field goal percentage of 52. McDermott alone would\u2019ve sold this trade as a positive, but the addition of Gibson gives them a defensive presence underneath the rim. The idea of Gibson and Steven Adams being backed up by Domantas Sabonis and Enes Kanter (when healthy) is encouraging for the postseason. Here\u2019s hoping Gibson and McDermott can grow mustaches. WYD, Chicago Two seasons ago, Anthony Morrow was a solid bench contributor. His eFG was nearly 58 percent, and on average, he\u2019d produce 10.7 points in around 24 minutes per game (if those numbers sound familiar, it\u2019s because they are almost exactly McDermott\u2019s from this season). He\u2019s been in and out of a funk (mostly in) since, with depleted minutes. OKC has gotten double-digit scoring from Morrow only eight times this season. Payne can count on more playing time behind Rajon Rondo (or Michael Carter-Williams) than he ever could\u2019ve backing up Westbrook. Chicago\u2019s offense won\u2019t change much when they sub the second-year player (33 percent from the field) for the vet (37 percent from the field) and revitalize Morrow\u2019s former self\u200a\u2014\u200abut maybe that\u2019s not their plan after all, as the 2016\u201317 Bulls have acquired a taste for nonshooters. As for Lauvergne, that might just be a contract the Bulls have agreed to bite. Here\u2019s Danny Chau on the Frenchman: \u201cHe\u2019s not really a guy who moves the needle much. He plays really hard, and is a team-oriented player who can move the ball around, but he\u2019s not a rim protector or a good rebounder for his size because of his lack of length. He has range out to the 3-point line, but he hasn\u2019t shown much consistency with it. Joffrey\u2019s probably just a contract being thrown in here. They\u2019re much better off giving their other young bigs like Cristiano Felicio as many minutes as they can handle.\u201d The Report Early rumors had Andre Roberson as part of this trade, but apparently the Thunder want to keep him when he enters restricted free agency this offseason. He\u2019s a defensive gem, though the other end of the court is a work in painful progress\u200a\u2014\u200aof the 57 games this season, he\u2019s had 13 with 10 or more points; he\u2019s averaging 30 minutes a game, and just 6.6 points. Maybe there are other reasons the Thunder want to keep him. Only Sam Presti knows. The Slight\u00a0Bummer According to Royce Young, Russ and Cameron stopped dancing around the new year, but it\u2019s still where OKC will feel his absence most. Can Dougie actually Dougie?
