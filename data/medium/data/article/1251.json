Since I\u2019m guessing many of us may be carrying around our own set of dystopian fears right now, let\u2019s push our individual concerns to the back of our minds so we can discuss one potential dystopia together: the looming threat of immortality. Slate Money on the Cost of Living ForeverListen to Episode No. 130 of Slate Money: On this episode of Slate Money, hosts Felix Salmon of Fusion; Cathy O'Neil\u2026www.slate.com Today\u2019s Slate Money podcast discusses all of the terrible things that might happen if we either live forever (an improbable, but possible, scenario) or significantly increase our lifespans (a more probable scenario). \u201cThere are really big problems with people living forever. Like, economic problems,\u201d Felix Salmon explains. Let\u2019s say we put a rich person in a cryogenic freezing chamber and keep that person there for 40 years. That person\u2019s money is likely to earn a whole bunch of compound interest, making the rich person even richer and effectively locking that money up and keeping it out of the rest of the economy. If the rich person owned property, that property might be locked up as well. After all, the rich person is going to need a home to come back to after they unfreeze the head and attach it to either 1) a younger body or 2) a robot. I\u2019m not sure I completely agree with this dire scenario, since there are certainly ways for both the rich person\u2019s money and their property to continue to circulate in the larger economy even while their owner is on ice\u2014endowments, letting heirs manage the finances, maybe renting out some of that property on Airbnb\u2014but yes, freezing rich people is likely to freeze at least some of their wealth. Freezing rich people is also likely to freeze progress, even though people seem to think the opposite will happen. (This is the \u201cif only they had frozen Steve Jobs\u201d theory, which Slate references.) It\u2019s like\u2026 nobody wants Iron Man 4. Tony Stark is a charismatic and innovative superhero and I certainly enjoyed the first couple of Iron Men and then I fell asleep during the third one, because Tony wasn\u2019t doing anything new. He puts the Arc Reactor in, he takes the Arc Reactor out. He puts his suits together and he takes his suits apart. That\u2019s what he\u2019s all about. \ud83d\udc4f So yeah, now you know what I think of the potential terror of living forever, and I haven\u2019t even started with my individual fears of, like, what would I do if they told me I could be immortal? Would I sign up for the cryofreezing thing, or would I remain steadfast to my original plan of dying and then getting turned into a cremain diamond that gets set in a piece of costume jewelry and donated to a community theater, which is seriously what I would like to happen after I die, please consider this a legitimate request?
