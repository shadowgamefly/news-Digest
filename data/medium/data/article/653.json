{"name": "653", "parent": "", "content": "The One Reason I\u2019m OK Leaving My Job Without a Master\u00a0Plan Here\u2019s my current situation: I\u2019m leaving my job and I don\u2019t have everything figured out. I don\u2019t hate my job, dislike my co-workers, or find my manager annoying. I enjoy what I do and work with pleasant folks. And my manager is my friend. So why am I doing it? Why would I disrupt a perfectly good situation for the stress and anxieties of being self-employed? Because I\u2019m capable of adapting. When I get comfortable, I get\u00a0bored My wife and I are totally different people than when we met 9 years ago. I read sad stories of relationships that came undone because the person they\u2019re with now isn\u2019t the person they fell in love with. They changed. In our relationship, change is the only constant. It\u2019s actually encouraged. (It\u2019s why we purposely had a kid at a young age.) We\u2019ve learned we are quite good at adapting to new situations and challenges. In July, we are selling our stuff and downsizing into an even smaller apartment (again, we\u2019re doing all this with a growing toddler). Why? We want something new. We want a challenge. We want to upset the status quo. And that\u2019s what has brought me to this point, in June I leave a safe, secure, and relatively enjoyable job without any master plan. To me it\u2019s the next logical move. My next experiment. I thrive when my situation changes and what greater way to push myself is there than diving head first into the world of self-employment? I can\u2019t just show up to work and expect a paycheck every other week. I\u2019ll have to adapt to the ever changing economy and fight for every dollar. I want an adventure, not a cubicle. Why are you afraid of\u00a0change? I watched a movie recently with my wife called Midnight in Paris. It\u2019s about this writer who wishes he could go back in time and live in the 1920\u2019s when everything was better. One night he takes a stroll down the streets of Paris and as the clock strikes midnight an old car pulls up beside him. The passengers motion for him to climb inside, he does and is transported 90 years back in time where he meets to likes of Hemingway, Picasso, and Fitzgerald. He also meets a woman who wishes she lived in the 1890\u2019s, back when everything was better. He couldn\u2019t understand how someone from the 20\u2019s would ever want to live in a different time period. When we fail to accept the present as an ongoing evolution, we deny our nature. When we live thinking the present will always be with us, we live a lie. When we long for the past, we stagnate. Why are you afraid of change in your life? Why are you you afraid of finding new challenges? Do you think you\u2019re incapable of adapting? Do you think you won\u2019t find happiness? Humans have been evolving for tens of thousands of years. We\u2019re quite adept at it. Stop trying to encapsulate time. Stop trying to block out change. Welcome it, and enjoy the journey that follows. Hey there I\u2019m Declan! I\u2019m going through a major life transition right now and would be stoked if you tagged along.
