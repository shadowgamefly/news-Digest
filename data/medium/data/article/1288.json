{"name": "1288", "parent": "", "content": "Everybody Has A\u00a0Day Paralee and Caroline get a free calendar and a brand new friendship Everybody has a date. One memorable day among all the others we\u2019ll dance, plod, shimmy, trot or trudge through. It\u2019s not a birthday or holiday. It sticks to us like the memory of our first kiss, if we are lucky, or our most devastating goodbye, if we are\u00a0not. Our date appears on every complimentary calendar haphazardly stuck to the side of the fridge, but it never needs circling. Every breath we\u2019ve taken from that day forward reminds us our lives, forever changed, are married to it, for better or worse, complete with its own private anniversary. Paralee\u2019s date was a day in April, and absolutely the only day she forbade herself to forget as long as she lived, lest it come upon her again. Which, despite having anything to do with morbid superstition swaying the odds, it was quite impossible for actual events on this date to repeat themselves. This, however, did not prevent her from reliving the details of it every year thereafter. To its credit, April 28, 1958, was extraordinary, in that spring in all its swagger was predictably upon the hills and valleys surrounding her and Carl\u2019s hometown and the suburb in which they resided was neatly cut up and looking like lime green icing on a Texas sheet cake sprinkled with mustard yellow and white daffodils. However, every year as winter grudgingly loosened its chilly grip on the porch thermometer and the ground began to thaw enough to play peekaboo with her perennials, Paralee began to watch the calendar with a wary eye and the inevitable weary heart. Knowing April 28th, was coming, as it always did, was not the same as being prepared for it. Paralee loathed this day. Each year, hopeful promises of reconciling fate and acceptance flattened along with her mood. Nothing could turn back the pages of history or the calendar to change what had happened that day, the day her and Carl\u2019s hearts broke simultaneously into two separate and alienated halves. Each year after the dreadful day they had always watched the calendar together, observing the day, their day, in silent grief, each other\u2019s solemn presence a grateful balm for the painful vacuum left by the loss of their only child. It was all the concession they could offer one another. \u201cWhat day is it, Paralee?\u201d Caroline asked absentmindedly, her nose buried in a borrowed copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. \u201cHow the hell should I know? Who gives a flying flapjack anyway, one day\u2019s the same as the next, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Paralee huffed. \u201cHow about I get us one of \u2019em free calendars the Willows puts out every spring before they\u2019s all gone?\u201d Caroline suggested, lowering her book and studying Paralee. \u201cWhy the hell for?\u201d Ain\u2019t nobody ticking off the days until they break us out of this joint and we sure as hell ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 parole unless we die, so why do we need to look at a calendar?\u201d Paralee groused. \u201cWell, for one, I like knowing when they\u2019re gonna be serving my favorite, meatloaf and mashed taters, and which night they\u2019s having Butterscoth Bingo,\u201d undaunted, Caroline gave her roommate her signature gummy grin. \u201cI don\u2019t want no dang calendar hanging up where I can see it, Caroline. Makes me feel like a useless convict,\u201d Paralee growled, \u201conly day I\u2019m interested in is my last one, the day they roll me outta them glass double doors on a stretcher. Stamp me: \u2018Return to Sender\u2019!\u201d \u201cOh, Paralee, don\u2019t talk like that,\u201d Caroline scolded, but knew well enough to leave it alone when Paralee\u2019s mood turned darker than usual. She\u2019d learned the hard way to scout out the currents and undertows always running beneath Paralee\u2019s gruff exterior and she decided to trust her friend had her reasons for not wanting a calendar hanging up under her nose. This year wasn\u2019t the first time someone had made a mistake and doubled the printing order for the Wilmington Willows annual calendar, and Mrs Montenegro was determined not to let them go to waste. She marched through the halls herself with an armload of them, stopping at every resident\u2019s room to slip one under their door whether they wanted it or not. Montenegro decided if the surplus was out of her sight she could assume they\u2019d come to good use. Caroline found their free calendar torn in two and chucked into the wastebasket, except for the month of April. The offending month had been extracted from between March and May like a rotten tooth. It laid on the floor in a crumpled ball where she assumed Paralee had tossed it. It didn\u2019t take Agatha Christie to put two and two together. Caroline was certain something awful had happened to her friend in the month of April, but what? The door to their shared bathroom was closed, but Caroline could hear Paralee sniffing on the other side. She sat on her bed and waited. Five minutes turned into ten and ten into fifteen. Caroline had had plenty of time to work up her nerve, but instead her imagination worked her over and she found herself hopelessly tongue-tied by the time Paralee finally emerged. \u201cWhat the hell, Caroline? Close your mouth before that last tooth falls out of your head from dry socket,\u201d Paralee snapped. Caroline ignored Paralee\u2019s put-off and looked her in the eye. \u201cI, uh, I want you to know I\u2019m here for you, Paralee. I know it won\u2019t change nothin\u2019 but I can listen if you wanna talk\u2026 about anything\u2026 anything at all,\u201d Caroline coaxed, tenderly. She was holding the crumpled ball of April in her cupped hands like an offering. Paralee froze. She stared at the paper ball in Caroline\u2019s hands; instead of the rejected month of April with its images of daffodils and sunshine, she saw April 28, 1958, the date she would never be permitted to forget. Her darkest day. It was the day her baby girl, Carla left them, the day she saw the light in Carl\u2019s eyes for the last time, and the day love hid itself so deep in her own heart she was never sure it hadn\u2019t gone completely. One day in which everything broke. Paralee\u2019s shoulders slumped and she exhaled deeply toward the floor. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ve carried this burden alone long enough now, Caroline,\u201d Paralee sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna keep offering your friendship along with that goofy grin of yours, maybe it\u2019s time to surrender and accept it.\u201d And with a slightly grateful, if not a somewhat chary smile, Paralee began her story from the beginning...
