{"name": "355", "parent": "", "content": "The Afterworld Saga\u200a\u2014\u200a4 Chapter Four: Her\u00a0Story Tamra gulped, her throat bobbing beneath the knife\u2019s edge. She blocked out Leida\u2019s panic when memories of her martial training came flooding back. Through keen eyes, she assessed the threat to her life and saw an opening to disarm Roy. \u201cI said who are you?\u201d he barked. \u201cAnd where\u2019s my sister?\u201d She raised both hands slowly, as if in surrender. If she didn\u2019t execute her move carefully, she\u2019d die again; and this time, she\u2019d be dragging Leida along with her. Her muscles tensed as she prepared to counter-attack. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Leida\u2019s voice pierced through the haze. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m in danger. Just tell him the truth.\u201d Tamra hesitated; then she relaxed. \u201cAs you wish, but pray he doesn\u2019t slit our throat before I get the chance.\u201d She drew a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not Leida, but if you kill me, you\u2019d be killing her too.\u201d Roy glared at her a minute longer before he removed the knife and backed away. \u201cTalk.\u201d She sat up and rubbed the front part of her neck where she could still feel the blade\u2019s imprint. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d he demanded. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026\u201d Tamra faltered. She\u2019d been about to say Leida was inside her but she thought it had a salacious ring Roy wouldn\u2019t find the least bit amusing. \u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d she said instead, pressing a palm to her chest. \u201cIn here.\u201d \u201cWhat in the gods\u2019 name are you talking about?\u201d He stepped forward, the knife pointed at her. With a good distance now between them, she could easily wrest it away from him. But he didn\u2019t need to know that. She needed him to think he was fully in control. She held up a hand. \u201cListen, my name is Tamra. I\u2019m the dead girl you saw on King\u2019s Way.\u201d He didn\u2019t say a word. He just stared at her. \u201cBelieve me, I know how absurd it sounds but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d He crossed his arms and stared harder. \u201cYou\u2019re holding a knife to me. If I was going to lie, wouldn\u2019t I have concocted something a little more believable?\u201d He uncrossed his arms. \u201cVery well,\u201d he sat on the stool in front of the dressing table, \u201clet\u2019s assume for a fleeting moment that I believe this nonsense. How did it happen?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He sneered. \u201cAll I know is that when I jumped from the tower, I died but somehow I ended up in your sister\u2019s body,\u201d she said. \u201cWith her.\u201d He squinted at her, no doubt trying to determine if she was telling the truth. \u201cHow did you come to be in the castle in the first place?\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cI was captured by The Shadows.\u201d Leida gasped. A tic moved in Roy\u2019s jaw at the mention of the notorious order of assassins who\u2019d taken their name from one of the feared demon classes in the Afterworld. \u201cAnd what would The Shadows want with you? Why did they capture you?\u201d Tamra desperately wanted to lie. She wanted to say they\u2019d planned to use her to collect a king\u2019s ransom from her father. Or that they\u2019d bought her at a slave market in Galene. But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cBecause I killed our leader.\u201d Leida gasped again. Roy\u2019s grip tightened around the knife\u2019s hilt. \u201cYou were one of them.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d In the quiet that followed, she sensed Leida\u2019s terror and urge to get as far away from her as possible. For some reason, Tamra couldn\u2019t bear for them to see her as a cold-blooded murderess. \u201cI was born in Elpis.\u201d Roy stirred when she spoke. \u201cI was the daughter of the wealthiest silk merchant in the city.\u201d She smiled from nostalgia. \u201cLife was wonderful. Perfect, even.\u201d The smile vanished. \u201cAnd then one night, a man garbed in black crept into our home and slaughtered my entire family.\u201d Both Leida and Roy were completely silent. \u201cHe killed my mother first.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cThen my father, and my younger brother and sister. He was going to kill me too, but I managed to escape. I wandered the streets and eventually ended up in the fighting pits where I learned to be strong.\u201d \u201cWhen I later discovered he was the Shadow Caliph, leader of The Shadows, I plotted my revenge and infiltrated their organization. It took a long time but I finally got the opportunity to make him pay for what he did. I tried to find out who contracted him but he refused to tell me.\u201d \u201cI fled after killing him but they found me and took me to the Shadow Keep, that\u2019s what they call the abandoned castle on King\u2019s Way. It\u2019s their secret lair here in Damaris.\u201d Roy cursed. \u201cThey were waiting for Nasim, brother and successor of the Shadow Caliph, to arrive. They would have tortured me before killing me and I refused to grant them that satisfaction.\u201d Her features hardened. \u201cVengeance was mine alone. And so I jumped to my death, but by some quirk of fate or jest of the gods, I was still alive. In someone else\u2019s body.\u201d \u201cAnd Leida?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cHow is she taking all of this?\u201d \u201cShe was terrified at first. But when she realized I was more disoriented than she was, she felt calmer,\u201d Tamra said. \u201cWe intended to consult with the oracle of Themis to\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d \u201cWe?\u201d he said. Then he shook his head, a pained expression on his face. \u201cShe asked you to keep it from me, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Guilt overcame Leida. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d Tamra tried to defend her. \u201cShe wanted to wait till\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d \u201cI want to speak to her.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how to give her control.\u201d He snorted. \u201cHow convenient.\u201d \u201cBelieve me\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d \u201cBelieve you?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAn assassin?\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cWhile your motives are understandable, the fact remains that you took lives to earn a place among The Shadows. So how do I know my sister isn\u2019t one of your victims?\u201d \u201cAsk me something,\u201d Tamra said. \u201cSomething only Leida would know.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWe have a shared telepathy. She\u2019ll tell me the answer and I\u2019ll relay it.\u201d \u201cDescribe the time of her birth to me.\u201d Leida told Tamra what to say. \u201cShe was born on the night of a full moon in Baukis. Your mother often boasted that she laughed through Leida\u2019s birth because it was so easy. Unlike yours.\u201d His mouth fell open. \u201cYour father\u2019s pet name for her was moon-cub.\u201d \u201cShe really is in there,\u201d Roy whispered, his eyes shining. He sheathed the knife and tucked it into his left boot. \u201cAll right, this is what will happen. I\u2019ll go with you to the oracle tomorrow.\u201d He got up. \u201cI believe you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I trust you so I\u2019ll stand sentry all night to make sure you don\u2019t try to flee.\u201d He turned when he reached the door. \u201cAnd given your penchant for jumping through windows, I\u2019ll have someone on watch outside too.\u201d After he left, Tamra lay back down. \u201cYour brother is ferocious.\u201d \u201cOnly where I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Leida said. \u201cTamra, I\u2019m very sorry about your family.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who suffered an unspeakable family tragedy.\u201d \u201cExcept in my case, my mother was the villain.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cShe went berserk one day and murdered our father and some of the townsfolk. She would have killed us too had the guards not arrived and struck her down. We were shunned by the town and forced to carry the shame of her atrocity.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why you went to the cliffs.\u201d \u201cYes, and after my epiphany, I packed up our things and we moved here.\u201d Tamra wanted to ask more questions, but she felt it was a sore point for Leida. At first light, they went to the Temple of Themis. Although they were early, they still met a queue waiting to see the oracle. When one of the acolytes saw them, he ushered them into the temple, ignoring the queue\u2019s grumbles. The oracle stood at the altar, her back to them. \u201cMy, my,\u201d she spoke without turning, \u201cit\u2019s been a while since I encountered a Vessel.\u201d Tamra and Roy glanced at each other, and back at the oracle. Together with Leida, they asked in unison, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Vessel?\u201d ", "title": "The Afterworld Saga\u200a\u2014\u200a4", "sentences": [{"270a": "The Afterworld Saga\u200a\u2014\u200a4"}, {"e863": "Chapter Four: Her\u00a0Story"}, {"eb62": "Tamra gulped, her throat bobbing beneath the knife\u2019s edge.
