{"name": "539", "parent": "", "content": "To stay or to be left\u00a0behind? So my boyfriend is the reason I moved back to my hometown. I hate it here. There\u2019s no where to go, nothing to do. My family lives here but I rarely see them. When my SO and I got together he didn\u2019t have a job. He had be laid off and we\u2019ve been struggling ever since. I left my job in the city to get away and when we got together he told me I didn\u2019t have to work that he\u2019d take care of me and my daughter. He used to be on unemployment. I am a widow. I was taken care of before and then when my husband passed away, I had to work. Then I met my boyfriend. It was nice to be taken care of again, although not to the degree that I was used to. I\u2019m talking about bare minimum if even that. Money has never been the issue, it\u2019s that I followed him here to live with HIM -at his family\u2019s home not with his family. With him. Not to be left behind when he finally got his job back. Not to have to go to my parents when he leaves for better opportunities. I feel hurt because he said he\u2019d take care of us. When we are upset he pushes me away. I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like when he leaves. Will I have to stay at his family\u2019s when it already beyond uncomfortable? Will he even care that I see it as wrong because he\u2019s the only reason I moved back here? To be with him\u2026 If he\u2019s gone and we have a disagreement I don\u2019t know if we will make it. I\u2019m already very upset. I have invested so much into this relationship, lost so much. It\u2019s like I\u2019m doing it all in vain because he seems to be so nonchalant about my feelings.
