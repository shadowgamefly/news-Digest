During a closed-door meeting earlier this month, President Trump told a bipartisan group of senators that if it wasn\u2019t for massive voter fraud in New Hampshire, he would\u2019ve won the state. But he presented no evidence for his claim that voters were illegally bused from Massachusetts to the Granite State, and a Federal Election Commission commissioner is calling him out on it. In a letter released Tuesday and published on the Federal Election Commission\u2019s letterhead, Commissioner Ellen Weintraub says she won\u2019t stop speaking out about Trump\u2019s baseless claim. \u201cThe President of the United States has, without providing evidence, alleged a massive conspiracy to bus thousands of voters from one state to another to cast illegal votes in the 2016 elections,\u201d Weintraub writes. \u201cAny such allegation challenging the legitimacy of federal elections would be of great concern to me,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs it happens, this particular allegation falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission, since the expense of these buses has not been accounted for on any campaign-finance filing.
