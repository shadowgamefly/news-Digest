The 1000 Day MFA is a program I run through Ninja Writers. We read a lot (a short story, a poem, and an essay every day), we watch movies, and we write a short story every week. That\u2019s Ray Bradbury\u2019s basic advice to writers. This quote basically rules my life and it informs my program: Just write every day of your life. Read intensely. Then see what happens.\u200a\u2014\u200aRay Bradbury We also work toward writing a novel every year and read at least one novel and one craft book a month. You can read more about it here: The 1000 Day MFAmedium.com The publication is a place for me to publish the short stories I write every week. They won\u2019t be perfect. They\u2019ll reflect my learning curve, since I generally write novels and short stories are a whole other animal. I\u2019m going to be very honest here. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m a novelist. I don\u2019t write short fiction. I\u2019m scared that people are going to hate my stories. Or (worse?) that no one will care enough to read them. Publishing fiction every single week is going to be rough, but exciting. My publication has zero followers. That goose egg is scary. I\u2019ll also post sometimes about The 1000 Day MFA experience. My goal is to post one short story every Sunday and one non-fiction post on Wednesday that will help people who are looking at being autodidactic writers. I\u2019m terrifying myself because I love you. This is an experiment I\u2019m going to give it eight weeks before I evaluate how it\u2019s working and I\u2019ll report back. If you\u2019ve been thinking about publishing fiction on Medium, hopefully what I\u2019m doing will be helpful to you. Basically, I want to figure out if there is any benefit to publishing short fiction on Medium. Here are some possible benefits and things I\u2019ll be paying attention to: Being read Ray Bradbury talked a lot about how he got his start writing short stories for fiction magazines in the 1940s. He was paid $20 a pop. In the 1940s, you could make a living with $20 short stories. According to this calculator, to adjust for inflation, that $20 was worth $271 today\u2019s dollars. Stephen King got his start similarly, in the 1960s. The same $20 in 1965 is worth $154 today. In 2017, the paying short story market just isn\u2019t designed to support an upstart storyteller. What markets there are pay the same $20. If you\u2019re lucky. Bradbury and King could both pay rent with one short story sale. The same just isn\u2019t true anymore. So\u200a\u2014\u200athe currency I\u2019m looking at for this experiment is readers. Eyeballs on my stories. If I publish on Medium, will people read my work? Will they be able to find it? Do people come to Medium to read fiction at all? Getting feedback Obviously, I\u2019m hoping that people will read the short stories I publish in The 1000 Day MFA. On a deeper level, I hope that readers respond to my work. I want feedback. I want to know which stories resonate and which fall flat. Which stories readers want more of. I\u2019m just going to throw this out there: responding to a writer\u2019s work is one of the best gifts you can give them. That little green heart matters. A quick response matters. I\u2019ll be watching over the coming weeks to see if readers respond to my stories. Building an\u00a0audience At my core, I\u2019m a novelist. I hope that publishing my short fiction here helps me to build an audience for my novels. I\u2019ll post a form for joining my mailing list with each story. I\u2019ve started a publication, so readers can follow it. My big take away from being published by Penguin is that it is very, very important for every writer to work on developing their own audience. Even the biggest traditional publisher won\u2019t do that for you. The effect of publishing I\u2019m not sure what else to call this. I want to pay attention to how putting work out publicly every week affects me as a writer. Does it push me to write better? Does it make me more cautious, since I know other people will for sure read what I\u2019m writing? If you want to follow along with this experiment, follow The 1000 Day MFA publication.
