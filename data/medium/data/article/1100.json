Trampled and beaten,wine turned into blood.The blood of the martyrs,cut into pieces,by that terrible lightning,hatred and bigotry. Woe to the oppressor,who Is oppressed,\u00a0by thine own words.You define abomination,in defense of your nation.Your mighty army,marches on. But not in the truth.Not in charity.Nor compassion.Not by the love,of our divine creator. Ryot.org Now you claim,oppression by the oppressed.You spout that your freedom,lies in the balance.That the weak are to blame. Don\u2019t you dare try,to claim our oppression.All that we have left,like the Leaven,that makes us rise. Yes, you are the oppressed,but not by us,who, hid in our shadows,and are free in our minds.Not by us who dwell in our truth. You are the prisoner,Of your own misdeeds.You are the oppressed,trampled under by fear,and put asunder by your,judgement of us. You are the soured wine that you drink,from your own grapes of wrath.You are the terrible swift sword,that cuts into your soul.
