MacMullan: It all started when LeBron left, right? Could you have ever imagined Earvin Johnson leaving Riley, or Michael Jordan leaving you? Jackson: It had to hurt when they lost LeBron. That was definitely a slap in the face. But there were a lot of little things that came out of that. When LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland and he wanted to spend the night. They don\u2019t do overnights. Teams just don\u2019t. So now [coach Erik] Spoelstra has to text Riley and say, \u2018What do I do in this situation?\u2019 And Pat, who has iron-fist rules, answers, \u2018You are on the plane, you are with this team.\u2019 You can\u2019t hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland. Maverick Carter, a member of James\u2019 so called \u201cposse\u201d explained the issues with the word choice: Carter: \u201cI don\u2019t care that he talks about LeBron,\u201d Maverick Carter told ESPN.com. \u201cHe could say he\u2019s not that good or the greatest in the world as a basketball player. I wouldn\u2019t care. It\u2019s the word \u2018posse\u2019 and the characterization I take offense to. If he would have said LeBron and his agent, LeBron and his business partners or LeBron and his friends, that\u2019s one thing. Yet because you\u2019re young and black, he can use that word. We\u2019re grown men.\u201d The word posse, to many, has a negative connotation. One that implies the people surrounding James are not useful and necessary members of James\u2019 business, but rather a group of freeloading men who are riding James\u2019 coattails. James himself, commented on the matter as well. It is completely plausible that Jackson had no idea of the fact that this word would be viewed as derogatory. With this being said, it doesn\u2019t mean that it is OK. Jackson is known for his extreme transparency in interviews and lack of hesitation when talking about guys still playing in the league, especially James (Jackson once said LeBron travels every time he touches the ball). If this was the case, it is necessary for Jackson to realize that while transparency with the media is as commendable as it is rare, precautions still need to be taken as to not to offend others as an expense. Carmelo Anthony, who has been a very strong social presence and black rights advocate, also made a comment this afternoon on the word choice and interview. Anthony didn\u2019t say anything worthy of creating more controversy but certainly showed he wasn\u2019t thrilled either.
