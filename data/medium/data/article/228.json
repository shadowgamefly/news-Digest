{"name": "228", "parent": "", "content": "How to Live with the Muggle You\u00a0Love 10 Ways To Survive a Mixed Temperament Relationship My husband is negative by nature. Here\u2019s how he asked me out for the first time: You don\u2019t want to go to a movie, do you? I had to argue with him to give him the answer he wanted. It\u2019s just how he is. How his brain works. He\u2019s my darling curmudgeon. Our daughter calls him a muggle, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t know what a muggle is pretty much ties that one up with a bow. No matter what I bring up with him, his first response is to filter through every possible problem that might possibly ever happen in this or any other universe. Last week I asked him if he wants to spend a day at the beach when we visit Southern California in June. No brainer, right? But I got to hear about how he hates putting on sunblock, all about how there might be sharks, a story about how he was once at the Jersey shore and saw a turd floating in the water, and do I want to know who many dead people are cremated and their remains sprinkled into the ocean? And then: sure, let\u2019s go. It\u2019ll be fun. Only by the time he got around to it, I felt like I might never put a toe in water outside my bathtub again. After fourteen years, I\u2019m used to it. He comes by it naturally, both of his parents are the same. They\u2019re a Pennsylvania Dutch family and I sometimes wonder if it\u2019s cultural. I\u2019m a sunny California girl, and I\u2019m pretty sure my optimism is cultural. I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s rough on a natural optimist to run into a brick wall of pessimism on the regular. My thought process is the inversion of his. If you ask me if I want to go to the beach, I\u2019m halfway there before it occurs to me to remember that I was supposed to work this afternoon or that crowds make me itchy. Thank God I never think of things like cremains in the ocean. The negative filters into me later. It has to drip down through all positive so it just never gets the depth that his does. I\u2019m an idea girl. He\u2019s a results guy. I regularly try to take on the world. He holds on to my tether to make sure I don\u2019t float out into deep space. I\u2019m the mac, he\u2019s the cheese.
