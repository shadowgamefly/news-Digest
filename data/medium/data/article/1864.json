{"name": "1864", "parent": "", "content": "The Most Valuable Thing We\u2019ve Done for Our Product Managers in the Last Six\u00a0Months This is a real example of an email we send to all Product Managers at Buffer when a user\u00a0churns. A few months ago, all the Product Managers at Buffer started receiving a direct email each time somebody churned from a paid plan at Buffer. This is arguably the most valuable thing we\u2019ve done for our product team in the past six months, and I expect its value to compound over the coming months and years. But these emails weren\u2019t new: the leadership team have been receiving these automated messages for a long time as a way of keeping a finger on the pulse of churned users. By sharing this with the PMs (and anybody at the company who wants to receive them), we\u2019ve helped further reduce the chasm of understanding between a PM and their product. These emails allow us to build our intuition into the patterns and trends of churning customers. For each churn email, we ask ourselves some questions. Are they our target customer? Do they mention some specific functionality, or lack thereof? Do they mention billing or pricing? Do they sound frustrated? Happy? Over time, we\u2019re able to internalize various patterns and use that developed intuition in guiding product decisions. In many cases, we\u2019ll also reach out directly, not to ask for their business back\u200a\u2014\u200athat ship has sailed\u200a\u2014\u200abut for help. Here\u2019s a real-life example of how I might follow up to a churn email (names have been changed): I get one response for about every 10\u201315 of these emails I send. Remember, these users are no longer invested in Buffer. I think there\u2019s an Ed Sheeran song about this relationship dynamic. At this point in a customer\u2019s relationship with Buffer, they\u2019re no longer invested in us and may even be frustrated or angry with us, so responses are few. But there are responses, for which I\u2019m eternally grateful, and these are another tool to help us further refine our intuition: \u201cJennifer\u201d churned, but was very gracious in providing us with extra information about why, which helps us drive future product decisions. I can\u2019t recommend enough sharing this type of information widely and regularly with at least your product team, and ideally with everybody in the company who might benefit from building their product intuition this way. If you like this, please recommend or share freely! As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @redman.\u00a0:) ", "title": "The Most Valuable Thing We\u2019ve Done for Our Product Managers in the Last Six\u00a0Months", "sentences": [{"3bd4": "The Most Valuable Thing We\u2019ve Done for Our Product Managers in the Last Six\u00a0Months"}, {"cec9": "This is a real example of an email we send to all Product Managers at Buffer when a user\u00a0churns."}, {"9f79": "A few months ago, all the Product Managers at Buffer started receiving a direct email each time somebody churned from a paid plan at Buffer."}, {"c88c": "This is arguably the most valuable thing we\u2019ve done for our product team in the past six months, and I expect its value to compound over the coming months and years."}, {"82bd": "But these emails weren\u2019t new: the leadership team have been receiving these automated messages for a long time as a way of keeping a finger on the pulse of churned users.
