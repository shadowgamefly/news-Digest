{"name": "911", "parent": "", "content": "Where will UX design be in 5 years? 5 Predictions O\u2019Reilly\u2019s recently published 2017 Design Salary Survey showed not only that designers working in UX command the highest median salary ($89,000), but also that those adopting new tools like Sketch, and agile, iterative ways of working, attract the highest pay. In this article, we explore the future direction of UX design within the wider industry, and explain why we believe the trend towards hiring UX expertise will continue in the years ahead. Background: The rise of UX\u00a0design Design great Dieter Rams once said, \u201cYou cannot understand good design if you do not understand people; design is made for people\u201d. So, is all design ultimately user experience design? Someone, somewhere is going to experience the effects of any product we create, regardless of whether they interact with that product directly. Whatever our discipline, we design in the context of a human society, and we pursue projects because someone believes them to be valuable. In this broad sense, user experience is the essence of all design. The term \u201cuser experience design\u201d was coined around 25 years ago by Don Norman, current Director of the Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego. For him, \u201cUX design\u201d names a design process that prioritizes user needs in every aspect of a product experience, including everything that surrounds the product itself. For example, the user experience of an Apple Mac isn\u2019t restricted to interactions with the OS while it\u2019s switched on. A full picture of the Mac\u2019s UX design includes advertising, store layout, the purchase process, the box, the documentation, how it feels to hold, the esteem and social meaning of owning it, and so on. However, if we look up a typical job description for a UX designer today, we\u2019re likely to find a much narrower definition. In the past 5\u201310 years, UX design has acquired a more restricted meaning, usually referring specifically to the design of websites and mobile apps. This shift primarily reflects the huge commercial importance of those media: according to the latest Nielsen Total Audience Report, an average adult in the USA now spends nearly 4 hours a day using apps and websites on smartphones, tablets, and PCs. UX design\u00a0today Don Norman cautions against understanding UX design too narrowly, or as limited to device UI design: \u201cToday that term [user experience] has been horribly misused. It\u2019s been used by people who say, \u2018I\u2019m a user experience designer, I design websites,\u2019 or, \u2018I design apps,\u2019 and they have no clue what they\u2019re doing, and they think the \u2018experience\u2019 is that simple device\u200a\u2014\u200athe website or the app or who knows what\u200a\u2014\u200ano, it\u2019s everything\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the way you experience the world, it\u2019s the way you experience your life, it\u2019s the way you experience a service, or, yeah, an app, or a computer system, but it\u2019s a system that\u2019s everything. Got it?\u201d As we look at the state of UX design today, and consider its future, it\u2019s instructive to remember that UX doesn\u2019t begin or end with a device or an app in front of someone, even if that\u2019s the situation that we currently need to design for most often. It\u2019s the job of UX designers to look beyond interfaces, and address this bigger picture. Believe it or not, it\u2019s little more than 10 years since we lived in a world without smartphones, mobile apps, and social media. Particularly given the amount of time we now spend using these products, the pace of change has been remarkable. This has led manufacturers to seek ever greater optimisation of their products (think of the iPhone, or Google\u2019s Material Design), while companies that deliver products via these platforms have also had to experiment and rapidly figure out how to extract maximum value from them. Arguably, we are now seeing evidence that the pace of development, in smartphones particularly, is slowing. Manufacturers have spent a decade refining their products, such that the smartphone is now essentially a solved design problem. The changes we now see in products like the iPhone are minor and incremental: they make the existing solution marginally better, but don\u2019t take the product to a whole new place. Similarly, interaction design patterns in websites and apps are also becoming solved problems. For example, when designing navigation for a website or app, UI designers are likely now to refer to online libraries of navigation interaction patterns, at least as a starting point. Indeed, it\u2019s precisely because UX design is about meeting user needs and expectations that interfaces should use established, generally accepted interaction patterns, unless there\u2019s a good reason not to. So, what\u2019s next for UX design? The future of UX\u00a0design New markets UX design as we know it has evolved not only because of the ubiquity of smart technology (TVs, PCs, smartphones), but also because developed economies are increasingly focused on the service industry, where customer experience is crucial. What\u2019s more, as big developing economies such as India and China grow richer, whole new markets will open up for UX designers. For example, building health infrastructure will require solutions that respond to the fiscal and socio-economic situation of those economies. There is huge potential for UX designers with an interest in international development to contribute to the design of novel technological solutions for populations to access diagnosis and treatment. Technologies old and\u00a0new For a few years, there has been talk of the advent of virtual reality and augmented reality platforms, but there is little sign of these breaking through into mainstream culture. In an interview with FastCo Design, Greg Madison, a VR designer at Google Labs, expressed scepticism that VR will make a significant impression: \u201cFor me, laziness is the better way to predict what will happen in the future [\u2026] We haven\u2019t replaced the mouse and keyboard in 30 years, because with minimal effort, you can do lots of things. In VR, we need to think, it\u2019s not because we can, but [because we] need to do that.\u201d As a case in point, Google Glass (a kind of augmented reality pair of glasses) was retired in 2015 following poor sales and a range of safety and privacy issues. This tells us that whether a technology is successful is ultimately not going to be determined only by its level of innovation or its standard of execution. It also needs to be desirable to the user, and something that enhances their life in an important way. Currently there is little suggestion that the dominance of smartphones, tablets and PCs will change in the near future. The human animal\u2019s primary mode of experience is visual, and there seems to be little dissatisfaction with our current screen and text-based consumption of information. For many users, screen-based devices also establish important boundaries, allowing us to multi-task, move our attention rapidly between different focuses, and even turn them off. Artificial intelligence and machine\u00a0learning Soul-searching is happening in many professions at the moment, as high-tech, reliable, and inexpensive artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies are becoming a reality in every industrial sector. There are already commercial attempts at using AI to deliver design work. These tend to be focused on areas that requires a designer to execute a design that combines a number of visual conventions. For example, Logojoy offers an AI-based logo design service. When it comes to the work of UX designers in particular, it\u2019s unlikely that many tasks will become automated any time soon. Effective user research and user testing, for instance, are complex and require emotional intelligence and, importantly, an ability to understand which needs and behaviors are not present as well those that are. AI is still a long way off understanding the significance of things that people don\u2019t say or do. Human UX designers also benefit from an \u201cinsider\u201d perspective on human needs. In 2017, we don\u2019t know, philosophically, what it would mean for a machine to be capable of empathy or compassion\u200a\u2014\u200aso we are probably a way off from making such a machine a reality. Similarly, when it comes to visual design, understanding the complex cultural and emotional connotations of colors and their infinite combinations, and creating a meaningful, emotionally engaging look and feel for a product is likely to be something that always requires the involvement of human designers. However, AI could certainly play a role sooner rather than later in speeding up and augmenting human-led design processes. For example, hundreds of layouts, color schemes, and logos could be computed in seconds, allowing designers to identify attractive or viable ideas much more quickly. As strategist Russell Davies told this month\u2019s \u201cAI Issue\u201d of Creative Review, \u201cit may simply be more efficient and fun to get a machine to generate a thousand choices and then get a human to pick out the nuggets.\u201d Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are already being deployed in a range of technologies. Apple has Siri, Google has OK Google, Microsoft has Cortana, and Amazon has Alexa. Amazon, for example, has incorporated voice UIs into its Fire TV and Echo products. It\u2019s likely that users will find voice interfaces valuable in situations where visual attention is occupied (e.g. while driving a car), or where touch interaction or typing is not possible or desirable (e.g. while watching the TV). But voice UI is also likely to continue living alongside screen UIs, since nobody wants to be in a train carriage full of people giving voice commands to their computers. An underappreciated factor in the future direction of tech is also going to be people\u2019s inherent preference for what they have already learned. The keyboard layout on your smartphone is still QWERTY, a configuration that was originally devised in 1868 to minimise the clash of strikers on manual typewriters. Rationally better keyboard layouts, like Dvorak, were devised long ago, but haven\u2019t been widely adopted. The iPhone and iPod were successful because they delivered huge improvements to earlier products that delivered poor user experience (phones and music players); by contrast, Dvorak wasn\u2019t successful, because on the whole, the UX of the QWERTY keyboard was unproblematic, and it wasn\u2019t a change that users wanted or needed. The qualities of tomorrow\u2019s UX designers Adaptable It\u2019s not possible to see the future, but we can make some educated guesses about it. The past decade of change shows us that design must constantly adapt as a discipline, in order to meet new client, customer, and user needs. The job title of \u201cUX designer\u201d is likely to remain current for a while, but even if UX design roles becomes more specialized and fragmented, today\u2019s UX designer has a skillset that will make them adaptable and versatile. They have to deliver user research, user journey design, wireframes, prototypes, high-fidelity visual design, user testing, and even some coding. Wherever design heads next, UX designers will be in a good position to adapt. Detail-oriented, but capable of seeing the big\u00a0picture Charles Eames once said: \u201cThe details are not the details. They make the design.\u201d As design and interaction patterns become more standardised, companies will become more interested in making their product marginally better than the competition. This will mean a growing focus on the detail of UX design, in every sense: the visual appearance and behavior of the product; but also its speed, the extent to which it can anticipate a user\u2019s next requirement, and so on. Employers will look for detail-oriented UX designers who can deliver improvements at the micro level. Partly, this will happen as a result of market forces\u200a\u2014\u200asince companies that optimise the UX design of their product will likely succeed, while that that don\u2019t will likely go out of business. Importantly, there will always be the potential for disruptive new technologies to cause rapid and far-reaching change. For this reason, UX designers will be called upon not only to make focused, detailed product enhancements, but also to appraise wider design, tech, and market trends, and scan the horizon for possible paradigm shifts in how a product or service needs to reach and serve its users. Designers of user\u00a0trust Finally, look at any film, literature, or TV show that explores AI, and the dominant narrative is likely to be dystopian, involving technology gone rogue. As AI becomes a reality, particularly in high-risk applications such as automated cars, one of the key jobs of tomorrow\u2019s UX designer will be to design products that establish trust from the user towards the machine. Humans have a hardwired need to feel in control of their environment, and designers must find ways to meet this need, while also delivering the potential of AI to enhance human health, safety, and decision-making.
