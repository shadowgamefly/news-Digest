{"name": "219", "parent": "", "content": "This Is The Antidote For Digital Narcissism By: John P. Weiss I saw a guy walk into a street sign recently. It was hysterical. He was holding up his smart phone, intently talking to it. I\u2019m pretty sure he was filming himself. After he crashed into the sign, he cursed and dusted himself off. But then he held his phone back up and continued with his selfie monologue. Ah, the things we do for social media. Remember when that Pokemon phone app came out? Everyone was outside walking around like zombies. Some were oblivious to their surroundings and got mugged. Others nearly got run over by traffic. It all seemed a bit silly, but at least they were playing a game. Social media is different. It has become a kind of self esteem narcotic. People thrive on how many \u201clikes\u201d they get. They stage the best photos and curate the glamorous moments of their lives. It has become the new \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses.\u201d You log onto Facebook and see your neighbor Joe on vacation in Hawaii. \u201cMan, that guy has the life,\u201d you think to yourself. Or you land on your college friend Becky\u2019s Instagram page and see her feeding starving children in Africa. \u201cThat Becky, she\u2019s such a saint,\u201d you conclude. What you don\u2019t know is that Joe got divorced recently and can\u2019t afford that Hawaiian vacation. And Becky? She got all her stuff stolen in Zimbabwe and missed her connecting flight home. What\u2019s sad is that for some people, the vacation didn\u2019t happen and the charitable work doesn\u2019t count unless it\u2019s on social media. It has to be uploaded, seen and liked to matter. What you seldom see are the routine parts of people\u2019s lives. The boring stuff like reading email at work. Poring over spreadsheets and enduring conference calls. Doing the laundry and vacuuming. How boring! People only portray the cool stuff. The coffee shop photos or selfies in the gym, where they\u2019re showing up their sedentary friends. They share this stuff because it reflects well on them. They know it will garner lots of likes. And that makes them feel good. The question we should ask ourselves is this: What\u2019s the point to all of this? Are we really so unfulfilled and shallow that we have to construct a fairy tale life on social media? Look at me! Look at\u00a0me! Remember when you were a kid playing in the backyard or park? One of the things kids love to do is show off for their parents. Hang upside down on the monkey bars. Go to the top of the slide. Then yell out, \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d When our parents smiled and acknowledged us, it made us feel good. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with a lot of social media. We\u2019re documenting the cool parts of our lives and yelling, \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d When people like our post or leave a comment, we feel validated. I totally get it. In fact, I\u2019ve been guilty of the same thing. I put off joining Facebook for a long time. But once I set up my art site and started blogging, I learned that it\u2019s helpful to post content on social media. It helps drive traffic back to your website. So, I got a Facebook page and created a public page, too. Every time I did a new painting or blog post, I put it up on Facebook. I loved getting likes and positive comments. Before long I became more and more immersed in the tactics of online marketing and social media posting. I started to read about the best times to post. I learned about copywriting and online marketing. Website design, email newsletters and the importance of growing your list. Soon, my vanity for more likes on Facebook spread to my appetite for more followers on my email list. I spent hours tweaking my website and honing my art and creativity niche. Just like everybody else, I figured if I could grow a huge list then I could sell a bunch of eBooks and courses and live the laptop lifestyle. Like Tim Ferriss and his 4 hour work week. Along the way, though, I started to notice something. I wasn\u2019t very happy. Yes, my subscriber list grew and I truly value the readers who follow my art and musings. But likes and newsletter subscribers come and go. At best, they might affirm that you\u2019re doing some good work. At worst, they\u2019re just mildly interested folks who visited for a short time. The disease of digital narcissism Social media has become a place for distortions, where our real selves remain backstage. We photograph, photoshop, curate and upload the best we got. Then we hold our breath and pray for some attention. There\u2019s a name for this mindless appetite for attention and validation. It\u2019s called \u201cdigital narcissism.\u201d Writer Zoe Williams wrote a piece in The Guardian titled \u201cMe! Me! Me! Are We Living Through A Narcissism Epidemic?\u201d Here\u2019s an excerpt: \u201cElan Golomb describes narcissistic personality disorder in her seminal book Trapped in the Mirror. She goes on to describe the central symptom of the disorder\u200a\u2014\u200athe narcissist\u2019s failure to achieve intimacy with anyone\u200a\u2014\u200aas the result of them seeing other people like items in a vending machine, using them to service their own needs, never being able to acknowledge that others might have needs of their own, still less guess what they might be.\u201d Beyond the digital narcissism of social media lies the conceit and egotism that fuels our blogging and website dreams. We build our sites and create content for an amorphous audience of adulating fans. Or at least that\u2019s the hope. Think for a moment about all those \u201cgrow your list\u201d vendors out there. There are endless blogging websites and gurus who promise to help grow your audience. Just buy their killer course for $399 and you\u2019ll even get to join their private Facebook group. It\u2019s not that these folks are evil and I\u2019m sure they have helped a lot of businesses and industrious bloggers get to the next level. But before you dive into any of that stuff, you must come back to my earlier question: What\u2019s the point to all of this? For a lot of people, the point is twofold. Ego and money. Dedicate everything to your\u00a0passion There was a book that came out many years ago called \u201cDo What You Love And The Money Will Follow.\u201d The message of the book is well intentioned. Namely, that success comes from doing what we\u2019re passionate about. The problem is how we define success. There are plenty of actors waiting tables in Los Angeles. Waiting for their big break. Auditioning and holding on for that chance to find fame and fortune. They may be passionate about their acting, but there\u2019s no guarantee it will lead to money. Better to view success more deeply than just financial rewards. Not that money doesn\u2019t matter. All of us want to make money and enjoy the security and comforts that money can bring. But having money doesn\u2019t always translate to feeling successful. I\u2019ve met people who are financially wealthy but devoid of passion. They found success making money but not with finding a passionate life. I\u2019ve met others who live passionate lives on modest incomes. The latter seem happier to me. Some say the only people who claim money doesn\u2019t buy happiness are people without money. But that\u2019s not true. There are plenty examples of people who walked away from their wealth to find a more fulfilling life. For example, CEO\u2019s who quit the corporate treadmill and stress to have a quieter, more satisfying life. Here\u2019s a quote I like from Indian composer and musician A. R. Rahman: \u201cSuccess comes to those who dedicate everything to their passion in life. To be successful, it is also very important to be humble and never let fame or money travel to your head.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aA. R.\u00a0Rahman I\u2019ll bet if we asked A. R. Rahman, he\u2019d agree that being successful isn\u2019t about financial wealth but rather the spiritual nourishment that comes from doing the things we love. All of this gets back to the twofold reason people post like crazy on social media and nearly sell their souls to grow a blog: Ego and money. Their egos crave attention and before long they become full blown digital narcissists. Or their drive to live the laptop lifestyle and make money becomes their singular focus. Readers become abstractions to drive into a sales funnel. Herding nincompoops into sales\u00a0funnels The founder of my website host, Fine Art Studio Online (FASO), is a guy named Clint Watson. Clint\u2019s a former gallery owner and lover of fine art. He wrote a blog post about why he doesn\u2019t like pop-ups on websites. You know, those annoying messages that suddenly appear, trying to entice you to sign up for their newsletter, free eBook or whatever. Does anyone like pop-ups? I doubt it. They interfere with enjoying the content on a website. Yet all the research shows that they succeed with conversions (getting people to sign up). Clint Watson\u2019s blog post, Why I Don\u2019t Like Email Newsletter Signup Pop-ups, explains how he constantly had to train his art gallery salespeople in the art of \u201cqualifying\u201d their customers. As Clint noted: \u201cAt an art opening, you must strive to spend time with the people most serious and most likely to purchase. It\u2019s easy for a salesperson to fall into a routine of talking with the people who most want to talk. It\u2019s easy to sign up the people who are eager to join yet another mailing list.\u201d Now I know what the gang over at Sumo-me (they sell stuff like pop-ups to automate site growth) will probably tell me: \u201cHey, John, it\u2019s a free country. Don\u2019t use pop-ups if you don\u2019t want to. Good luck with your three subscribers.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing. I want subscribers who sign up and follow my art site because they love the content. Not because I enticed them with a pop-up. As Clint Watson went on to write: \u201cIf someone loves your art, they will contact you. They will stay abreast of what you\u2019re doing. And if they like receiving updates via email, they\u2019ll sign up for your mailing list. I\u2019m all for making your signup obvious and easy. Just don\u2019t be the salesperson who gets in your best prospect\u2019s faces, right when they\u2019re studying your artwork or reading your latest blog post.\u201d It\u2019s better to have a small but loyal list of fans than a large group of lukewarm Internet surfers who succumbed to your pop-up. Email pop-ups convert a lot of people who like to sign up for email lists. But how long before they unsubscribe and move on to the next pop-up offer? What do pop-ups have to do with digital narcissism? Everything. They are another example of the pervasive pursuit of ego and money. The whole racket is designed to herd on-line nincompoops into sales funnels for mostly uninspiring courses and products. Fortunately, there\u2019s an answer to all this madness. The privilege of a\u00a0lifetime There is an antidote for digital narcissism and this misplaced allegiance to ego and money. There is a better way to share your passion with the world. Instead of shamelessly asking people to like you on Facebook or luring lemmings with pop-ups, there is a way forward. The antidote for digital narcissism is this: Authenticity. Remember when you were a teenager and you wanted to be just like your favorite movie star or rock God? Do you remember what your parents told you? \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d People who stop trying to be something they\u2019re not eventually become their true selves. Which is a gift to the world because no-one is interested in cheap imitations. Authenticity works because people are drawn to it. There\u2019s no pretension. No desperate bells and whistles to get people\u2019s attention. Just a quiet, honest presentation of who you really are. \u201cThe privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.\u201d \u2015 Carl\u00a0Jung I\u2019m not saying social media is evil, or that you shouldn\u2019t try to make some money on-line. But don\u2019t lose your soul in the process. Invest in yourself and hone your craft. The cream always rises to the top. All the pop-ups, Facebook likes, photos with \u201cthought leaders\u201d and \u201csocial proof\u201d won\u2019t make you a better painter or writer. Only dedicated, hard work will do that. I\u2019ve often noticed that some of the painters I most admire don\u2019t spend a lot of time commenting on social media. They focus on their craft. And because they do, their work seriously stands out. When they do post their art on social media, the response is overwhelming. Why? Because it\u2019s the real deal. It\u2019s authentic. The antidote to digital narcissism is authenticity. Rediscover who you are, devote yourself to improving your craft instead of endlessly tweaking your website. Put in the time to create truly original, authentic art. Remember the humanity in others. If more people shunned the empty rhetoric of the Internet and invested in their own artistic and personal growth, I think we\u2019d see the death spiral of digital narcissism. Maybe even a renaissance like return to deeper, more meaningful art and personal expression. How cool would that be! Be yourself. Love your family. Embrace your authenticity. Hone your craft. See the humanity in others. That\u2019s the path to the kind of life that\u2019s worth living. Now what? Click the heart below to let others know you liked this article.
