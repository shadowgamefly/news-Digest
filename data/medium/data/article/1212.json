You\u2019d want to knowwhy and I couldn\u2019t provide theanswers to you. I just know. What I know. And what I know is I do not know ME yet. I thought I did. Yes, I used to be easier to deal with. Happenstance was a thing of culture, inevitable. Now, I am searching for odds and ends and tape doesn\u2019t seem to hold them together.

Until\u2026 There\u2019s always someone, a cause. The deep that carries into the deep. A mountain welcoming all molehills. There\u2019s always someone\u2026 And, that someone may not know they\u2019re your someone. You may not know you\u2019re theirs.

Distant\u2026 Lovers\u2026 One opens a door to pauses and taps, unafraid to dance amongst the stars. The other wishes the door to remain closed. No need in getting hurt all over again. Who has time to heal? Work in the morning. Work at night. I am responsible. I keep up with my daily routine. I take my vitamins. I visit my physician every three to six months. She and her staff poke and prod. They make sure my levels are where they need to be for me to continue to live a vibrant life. I smile. I nod. I tell her I have gained 23 lbs. She looks at my digital chart, nods, smiles, takes in what I am saying. She asks me about the weight gain. I tell her about you. Then, I\u00a0stop\u2026 She asks the same questions she asks every three to six months, \u201cAre you depressed? How is work? Still stressed?\u201d I lie. She will write a prescription, I will make it a ball and as soon as I am not within earshot, pitch it to the nearest wastebin. I do not need permission to feel.I do not need medication because I do. She will ask me at my next visit if I am still eating my leafy greens. If I am sticking with an exercise routine. If I have had any trouble with the medication. I will answer every question. I tell her of the gnawing painthat won\u2019t let up.\u00a0We discuss hot baths.salts, natural regimensthat will not harm my skin.She hands me a pamphletabout coping withloss. At that moment, I realize, I have not lost a thing. It is still in my heart. I cannot set it free. She does not understand. She is not in this body, wearing this skin, walking in these shoes. She smiles, she nods, she escorts me to the lab where the Phlebotomist does not even ask me, \u201cWhich arm would you prefer?\u201d anymore.

Distant is the heart that does not remember how to love.\u00a0Closer to a new beginning, this chapter almost finished,\u00a0I write-in a different main character, someone whoRemembers that bumps in the road are not permanent.
