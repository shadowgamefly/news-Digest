When I was just starting to think about finding a role in venture capital, there were a few people, senior GP\u2019s at top funds, that I reached out to ask for time and advice. The first did not respond. I assumed I was not a priority and after one follow up attempt, let it go. Is he disorganized? Bad at eMail? A little arrogant? Not sure. The second wrote back after a \u201cwarm introduction\u201d letting me know he was excited to meet, but couldn\u2019t do it for a few months. I was psyched. Then, a week before the meeting was supposed to happen, it got pushed back. I would call it rescheduled, but there was no new date offered. I persevered and kept in touch with his assistant for a few months and finally got a date on the calendar, that got moved and moved and moved. The purposeful waste of my time ground in like skin sliding on pavement. I felt disrespected by an arrogant asshole. The third GP replied to my cold email in less than an hour with a simple line that I will never forget: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d So elegant, honest and direct. With that quick note, I knew that he read my request and could not make time for me\u200a\u2014\u200aI was not a priority right then, and he was sorry about that fact. The quick clarity of his response showed me he was organized and purposeful about how he allocated his time and managed his priorities. I felt respected. Disappointed, but respected. I try to remember this when asking for time and when being asked for time. I can\u2019t give everyone my time and respect my priorities. But, I do have time to give everyone my respect.
