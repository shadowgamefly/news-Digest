(Photo: Anthony\u00a0McKeown) Last month I went to my first Not Westminster event. I\u2019ve blogged about the workshop we ran with my day job hat on here, but this is more of a personal reflection on the best (and only) 48 hours I\u2019ve ever spent talking about local democracy. I found out about Not Westminster last year when I was still a councillor in Hackney, picking up on twitter that one of the workshops was focussing on a \u2018failed\u2019 licensing consultation that had recently taken place in the borough. I soon became immersed in the mine of information, slides, snippets and videos on the site\u200a\u2014\u200aand came to appreciate (from afar) that this was a great group of people committed to bringing new ideas and energy to local democracy. I stood down as a councillor a few months later. After seven years, I needed a break (and my evenings back for the first time since my mid-twenties) but I didn\u2019t stop caring about local government. This involves having fairly regular and unstructured thoughts along the lines of: There are so many good ideas, tips and tools for creative engagement between councils, councillors and residents\u200a\u2014\u200ahow do we make these the norm rather than the exception? What can we learn from examples of co-design that have worked in practice, and be bolder and braver in how we shape the future in local areas? I want a member of the public to go to their council website and understand what decisions are being made, and know exactly how they can get involved. Why are Full Council meetings so dull? I could go on. I\u2019m now on the outside, which makes figuring out what contribution to sensibly make a bit harder. But one thing I\u2019m certain about\u200a\u2014\u200aNot Westminster has given me motivation and enthusiasm again at just the right time: \u201cIf we want a stronger local democracy we all need to get involved in making it happen.\u201d I\u2019m probably in the \u2018ex-council folk finding it hard to let go\u2019 category. Many Not Westminster 2017 participants have already blogged about the event, but I couldn\u2019t resist a rather lengthy top ten: (Photo: Anthony\u00a0McKeown) 1) Day 1 and designing practical experiments introduced me to the hack ethic and it\u2019s liberating call to do rather than talk. Unfortunately, I love to think, write random things on post it notes, and then talk and think a bit more. But that didn\u2019t matter! The group I was in focussed on how to make the policy process more engaging for residents\u200a\u2014\u200awe built a shopping centre out of cardboard, dissected the policy cycle, and the questions that residents might have at different stages of difficult decisions. We clarified what the issue is, and ended with a willingness to explore what a one stop policy shop on a council website might look like in practice. That\u2019s one thing on my list above ticked off already\u2026 2) It\u2019s really hard to build a structure out of spaghetti and balance a marshmellow on the top. However, for newcomers to the Not Westminster network, this was a lovely way to break down some initial barriers and start to get to know people. 3) One of my favourite ideas that came out of Day 1 was a video clip summarising council business. John produced a sample in an hour. I\u2019ve always been a bit sceptical about live streaming council meetings, as having been present at far too many, I wonder who would willingly decide to watch one when there\u2019s Netflix to compete with. However, I do appreciate the importance of transparency. The potential of the video summary is in communicating useful bits of information in a snappier and more accessible format, showing the people involved rather than an institution. (Photo: Anthony\u00a0McKeown) 4) The Pecha Kucha format is brilliant. I loved the fact that I spent my Friday night sipping a craft ale and listening to the history of local government one minute, and a father\u2019s conversation with his 14 year old daughter about local democracy the next. I might start doing all my presentations in the future as 20 x 20s slides. 5) I\u2019d never been to Huddersfield before despite a large part of my grandfather\u2019s side of the family having lived there. It has a fascinating heritage, and I discovered a very nice font whilst devising my own version of the radical walking tour. The Democracy Commission has engaged over 1000 local people in designing a healthy democracy for the future, which is all the evidence I need that there is something special happening in Kirklees. (Photo: Anthony\u00a0McKeown) 6) On Day 2, Social Life took one of the workshops on a walk to understand the \u2018feeling of a place\u2019. We explored our reactions at three different points to understand the influence of the built environment. This is something that every councillor and officer working at neighbourhood level should do. You think you know your patch, but take the time, stop, think and listen and I guarantee you\u2019ll notice something different. 7) As others have highlighted, if you do one thing after reading this, watch Emily Warrilow talk aboutJo Cox, 24 mins into the morning session here. This was about friendship, a tragedy and heartbreak\u200a\u2014\u200abut also a political awakening. As one of the organisers tweeted, \u2018If Emily is anything to go by, the future is bright\u2019. (Photo: Anthony\u00a0McKeown) 8) There were presentations on INLOGOV\u2019s 21st Century Councillor research and DMU\u2019s councillor commission. This work (and the emerging LGIU/Fawcett Local Government Commission) has helped restore my faith that the changing role of the councillor is now well documented and understood. But what do we do next to better support councillors in their roles? I get a bit frustrated when people say councillors need to embrace social media and communicate more effectively with residents. There\u2019s so much more to it than that. 9) Did anyone have time to make use of the nap room? The day just flew past in a flurry of workshops, contributing to live notes, grabbing some sandwiches and staring at owls on a map to see where everyone had come from. 10) I want to continue to share (and borrow!) ideas and focus on what next. Thanks to everyone who organised Not Westminster. Talking about local democracy is beautiful. Just look at Anthony\u2019s photos, and you\u2019ll understand.
