{"name": "325", "parent": "", "content": "How This Founder Wants to Apply Her Technology to Help Save the Planet\u2019s Resources There are so many moments from the Upfront Summit that I want to share with you\u200a\u2014\u200ait just takes time to watch through all the videos, do write ups and still do my day job. One of the most exciting thinkers at Summit was Rebecca Kantar, the founder of Imbellus. I was excited to see her perform on stage because I\u2019ve long been telling people how crazy smart, ambitious and talented she is but I was excited for people to hear for themselves. I wrote up the background of her company Imbellus here\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially she\u2019s building world simulations to assess human potential with the short-term goal of helping the most advanced companies have break-throughs on recruiting top talent but her longer term goal is to help use this rubric to help change how we teach children in America. If you want to know more about her company you should read the above link because her presentation at the Upfront Summit was taking her vision several steps beyond the current scope of our next few years plans and talking about her hope of helping to develop systems to save humanity. I\u2019ve long told friends & colleagues that when I meet with Rebecca I feel like a need a human record player where I can slow down the RPMs so I can actually follow what she\u2019s saying as she\u2019s always two steps ahead of what my 386-processor brain can compute. If you watch this amazing video I think you\u2019ll get a sense for what inspires me about Rebecca\u2019s potential as a visionary and thinker and also have some sympathy for me trying to keep up with her. At least it\u2019s recorded so we can hit the stop & rewind button\u00a0:) I think you\u2019ll really enjoy this talk on human potential. I know I did. And I think we\u2019re all rooting for the Rebecca\u2019s of the world to develop platforms to help us evolve our world and deal with the kind of resource-constrained systems we will likely encounter.
