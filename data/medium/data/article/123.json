{"name": "123", "parent": "", "content": "The Blazers Won\u2019t Win in Six, but So\u00a0What? What\u2019s Damian Lillard supposed to say, that his team will\u00a0lose? Damian Lillard and the Trail Blazers battled their way into the NBA playoffs, winning 10 of 14 games down the stretch to finish one game ahead of the Nuggets for the eighth seed. (It\u2019s almost like the Nuggets shouldn\u2019t have traded Jusuf Nurkic to the Blazers in February.) Their reward? A matchup with the freakin\u2019 Golden State Warriors, who somehow just made a 67-win season feel underwhelming. The Warriors won all four games this season against the Blazers and beat a better Portland team in five games in last year\u2019s playoffs. But Lillard sparked a fire by saying he thinks his team can win in six games. There\u2019s an obvious connection to be made with my personal favorite athlete prediction of all time. When Brandon Jennings and the 38\u201344 Bucks faced off against the defending champion Miami Heat in the first round of the 2013 playoffs, Jennings confidently told reporters he thought the Bucks would win in six. The Bucks got swept. There\u2019s a major difference between Jennings\u2019s prediction and Lillard\u2019s. Jennings made his statement virtually unprompted\u200a\u2014\u200anobody asked him how many games he thought his team could win in\u200a\u2014\u200aand continued to repeat his mantra, even when the Heat won the first two games of the series. Meanwhile, Lillard was asked whether he thought the Blazers would win in six or seven games and, while laughing, chose six. We really shouldn\u2019t be making a big deal out of it. It\u2019s like if somebody asked if you prefer the Big Mac or Whopper, you chose the Whopper, and a ton of blogs wrote posts about how your favorite food in the world is the Whopper and you\u2019re unreasonable for trashing Big Macs. Some people accuse you of hating McNuggets. Your initial assessment was wrong\u200a\u2014\u200aBig Macs are way, way, way better\u200a\u2014\u200abut there\u2019s no need for takes. Unfortunately, Lillard\u2019s comment was about the Warriors, who have proved expert at turning the slightest slights into declarations of war. My guess is that Draymond Green has already tattooed \u201cBlazers in six\u201d on the inside of his lower lip. An 8-seed playing a 1-seed faces impending doom. Since the NBA switched to a 16-team playoff format in 1984, 63 of 68 1-seeds have won their first-round matchups: about 93 percent. Yes, that leaves five massive upsets, but a few of those underdogs had extenuating circumstances on their side. (The 1999 Knicks should not have been an 8-seed, and I will fight you if you disagree. Several of the Knicks might join.) And the Warriors are better than your average 1-seed: They won 14 more games than the 1-seeded Celtics in the Eastern Conference. \u201cX in six\u201d is an attempt at speaking an impossible result into potential reality. With athletes, we expect confidence\u200a\u2014\u200ahell yeah, we\u2019re going to win this series\u200a\u2014\u200aor nonconfrontation\u200a\u2014\u200awell, our opponent is a great team, and the series is going to be tough. \u201cX in six\u201d isn\u2019t really either. It\u2019s somebody who wants to sound brave, but, doesn\u2019t want people to think they\u2019re oblivious, so they say something that isn\u2019t that ludicrous. Like, are we really saying Lillard is being too cocky? He\u2019s predicting that his team is going to lose two games. The joy of \u201cX in six\u201d is that it\u2019s an attempt at sounding reasonable when predicting the unreasonable. Most likely, the Blazers will lose, and perhaps we\u2019ll be able to lightly roast Lillard for being a tad overconfident. Or maybe he\u2019ll play the best basketball of his career for six games\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least four of them\u200a\u2014\u200aand do the damn thing, proving himself right, stunning the world as Ballin\u2019 Nostradamus.
