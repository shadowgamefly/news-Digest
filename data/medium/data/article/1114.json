The church is well known throughout the city for its progressive stance, and leaders were delighted by the heavy turnout. \u201cWe packed the sanctuary for that,\u201d Rev. Paul Beedle, the minister of First Unitarian, told ThinkProgress. \u201cWe had to have 200 people.\u201d But when the congregation gathered for Sunday services two days later, the mood shifted. As members worshipped in the sanctuary, a parishioner found a gaping hole yawning out of a stained glass window in a hallway. Dozens of brightly colored shards lay scattered across the floor. Someone had thrown a brick through it. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-paneled piece that represents the recovery from the [Katrina] flood,\u201d Beedle said, noting that police are currently investigating the incident. \u201cIt\u2019s a treasure to us.\u201d Beedle couldn\u2019t be sure the attack was an act of hate. But he suspected it was \u201cprobably\u201d connected to the transgender rights event, as it was the first time the church has been attacked in such a brazen way. Members of First Unitarian have reason to be concerned about foul play: their experience is part of a troubling\u200a\u2014\u200aand largely unreported\u200a\u2014\u200aphenomenon impacting several left-leaning religious communities across the United States. Threats against churches haven\u2019t risen to the scale of the recent wave of bomb threats directed at Jewish Community Centers or the steady stream of attacks on mosques and Islamic centers. But many outwardly progressive congregations say they are also part of the surge of hate that has rocked so many communities since Donald Trump\u2019s election. Many outwardly progressive churches say they are also part of the surge of hate that has rocked so many communities since Trump\u2019s election. Rev. Peter Morales, president of the liberal-leaning Unitarian Universalist Association, said that attacks on Unitarian Universalist (UU) churches have escalated over the past three years\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly against those that trumpet their progressive religious values. It\u2019s not an entirely new issue, he said. Several congregations displaying Black Lives Matter (BLM) banners in front of their buildings or waving rainbow flags in their church lawns have seen them defaced as early as 2015. \u201cSome of this goes back a ways,\u201d Morales said. But Morales said things have only gotten worse during Trump\u2019s rise to power. Since the election, a BLM signs outside UU churches in Boston and in Pittsburgh have been defaced, and swastikas have been scratched into the doors of a congregation in New York City. CREDIT: Paul\u00a0Beedle \u201cUnfortunately I think with the election, this administration has given encouragement and a kind of legitimacy to acts of hate,\u201d Morales said. The uptick extends beyond UU churches. In addition to black churches that have been defaced seemingly for no other reason than having a majority African-American congregation, virtually any faith community that takes a public progressive stance can become a target. A sign outside a Maryland Episcopal advertising a Spanish language service was scrawled over with the slogan \u201cTrump nation whites only,\u201d for instance, and a Florida man threatened to launch an assault on a LGBTQ-friendly United Church of Christ church that would make the Orlando massacre \u201clook small.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately I think with the election, this administration has given encouragement and a kind of legitimacy to acts of\u00a0hate.\u201d Many of the attacks appear to emanate from anti-LGBTQ vitriol. In Tempe, Arizona, a man reportedly stormed into the offices of Disciples of Christ church about a month after the election, complaining about a rainbow flag flying out front. He then allegedly spouted hatred for LGBTQ people, saying he would pay people to protest outside the church. His inspiration? Trump. \u201cHe said that if Hillary would have won he would have driven right on by the church without stopping, but because Trump won he felt he had permission to say and act the way he wanted to expressing the hate that he had for this particular group of people,\u201d Doug Bland, the church\u2019s pastor, told 3TV. If there is one Christian denomination that has likely endured a disproportionate number of anti-LGBTQ attacks of late, it\u2019s the Metropolitan Community Church, whose membership is largely LGBTQ. Rev. Elder. Rachelle Brown, Interim Moderator of MCC, said she knows of at least five churches that have endured attacks since Trump\u2019s election. In St. Petersburg, Florida, an MCC church was defaced with Nazi symbols and Trump\u2019s campaign slogans. Brown said that members of her denomination are hardly surprised by the recent surge\u200a\u2014\u200aif anything, they\u2019re used to it. The MCC\u2019s openly pro-LGBTQ identity has long made its congregations a target for homophobic hatred: the infamous UpStairs Lounge arson attack, where 32 people were killed in a horrific blaze, occurred during an MCC gathering that met in the gay club in downtown New Orleans. Until the 2016 Pulse Nightclub shooting, it was the deadliest assault on the LGBTQ community in U.S. history. \u201cThere is a new boldness.\u201d \u201cI had one pastor tell me, \u2018Since the inauguration, we\u2019ve only had 4 windows broken out\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to 110 after the marriage ruling,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just normal.\u201d Even so, Brown said the new spate of attacks since Trump\u2019s election feels different. Denomination officials created a \u201cReport Hate\u201d portal on the front page of the MCC website shortly after the election, encouraging members to document any attacks they receive or witness. \u201cThere is a new boldness,\u201d she said, noting that hate incidents aren\u2019t occurring in places that she says are unusual, such as Seattle or the Northeast. \u201cThe intensity has shifted.\u201d Despite this, none of the church leaders who spoke to ThinkProgress felt the attacks would impact their faith-fueled compulsion to preach an inclusive, progressive religious message. If anything, Brown said, it\u2019s emboldened them to be louder, hoping to defeat hatred with love. \u201cPeople of faith help to change the tide on marriage equality, and I think people of faith can help change the tide on this,\u201d she said. In New Orleans, Rev. Beedle is similarly defiant. \u201cOur message is: this is not going to change our commitment to stand by the transgender community, or any of our neighbors who are marginalized or who are suffering under systemic oppressions,\u201d he said.
