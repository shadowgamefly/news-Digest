{"name": "227", "parent": "", "content": "What makes work\u00a0bearable Why do people stay in the same job for years, decades and even their entire lives? Based on most articles on the Internet, experts would cite the feeling of having one\u2019s work appreciated, to serve a cause bigger than oneself or the standard \u201cmoney\u201d answer. I\u2019m not an expert myself but from my working experience and the colleagues I met over the years, people stay in the company for extended periods of time because of\u2026 people. Fellow human beings. In fact, I personally find most of the jobs I worked in so far bearable if I enjoyed my colleagues\u2019 company. As much as business experts would say people stick with the same company for years because they believe in the company\u2019s cause and values, isn\u2019t it too utopian to think everyone in any global company believes in the founder\u2019s vision one-hundred percent? Heck, even medium-sized companies with less than 50 employees wouldn\u2019t deny the fact at least a handful are just in it for the extra bit of glitter on their CV. Of course, I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t loyal and devoted employees working in any company\u200a\u2014\u200athere are plenty. I\u2019m referring to those of us who joined a company because it\u2019s our first job, we don\u2019t really know what we want but the company is kind of cool and offers us a job we\u2019re at least mildly interested in. Or those of us who need to feed a family and the paycheque satisfies that priority. But what is it that makes working in a company whose values don\u2019t necessarily align with ours, bearable? Is it really just money or is there something deeper and more satisfying? Let\u2019s not even talk about doing meaningful or fulfilling work because it is just not possible for every single person on this planet to do exactly what they want to do. If everyone were to just set out to do what might seem like their \u201ctrue calling\u201d, economies might start to collapse. I\u2019m not an economist, don\u2019t take my word for it. What I\u2019d prefer to discuss is what exactly can make our job bearable when it gets tough, considering the very fact it is impossible for every working adult to be in their dream job? To answer this question, I first asked myself, what would happen if my current colleagues whom I\u2019ve grown pretty close to, were to suddenly leave the company? Just a little background, I joined the company because I wanted to write and I was offered the chance to, so here I am. There are certain company values I don\u2019t particularly believe in but I love my colleagues. So what if one or a few of them were to leave? My Mondays would be a lot bluer, lunch breaks would be quieter, the working days would seem like ages to go through. What would happen to all the laughter when we poke fun at each other? How about the morning chats before starting work? Lesser people will mean the air condition will be a lot colder too. Please, anything but that\u200a\u2014\u200aI hate the cold. It turns out I\u2019m not the only one who feels the same way. From my chats with friends who are offered better-paying jobs and possibly something more aligned with their interests, they always give me the same answer when asked what is holding them back from moving on to a greener pasture: the people. The colleagues whom we go out to eat and drink with after work. The colleagues who were there for us when things get tough during office hours. The colleagues whose mere presence is sufficient to get us through nights of overtime. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, though. Most company employees spend eight hours or one-third of the day in the office for five days a week on the average. Add in our sleeping hours and commuting time and we\u2019re actually spending more time with our colleagues than anyone else in our life. Well, at least on working days. Yes, even if we don\u2019t talk to each other every single moment at work, the occasional glances and smiles at one another, the coincidental encounters in the common toilet, the short few-minute chats while brewing coffee or tea\u200a\u2014\u200aall these add up. These little bits of personal interaction are what make work bearable even in the hardest of times. Of course, we should never forget the support we get from our loved ones and friends who listen to our complaints and rants about either the job scope, our boss or clients. But the ones who truly understand our problems at work are the very people whom we work with\u200a\u2014\u200aour colleagues. If there\u2019s anyone who should understand any difficulties at work, it should be them. Sure, there are many ways we can get out of an \u201cordinary job\u201d, as many successful entrepreneurs and business people teach us in tonnes of viral articles out there. They talk about how everyone is merely settling for a mediocre lifestyle and how we all should set out to build a vision we have. These are all insightful advice and can inspire and motivate people with a clear vision and goal in mind to get off their asses and grind their way to success. But for most of us \u201caverage Joes\u201d and \u201cplain Janes\u201d who don\u2019t have either the luck or tenacity to pursue our dreams and venture out to start our own business, we try our best to bear with the hardships and monotony of leading a mediocre lifestyle. Remember, not everyone can and want to build a business from scratch. And the people around us, be it colleagues, friends or family members, are the reasons why work and life can be bearable even in the darkest moments.
