{"name": "506", "parent": "", "content": "Three questions to ask yourself, before speaking to your\u00a0users If only it were this\u00a0simple\u2026 It\u2019s not enough to just tick the box of \u2018talking to users\u2019 and think that doing so will mean you\u2019ll magically end up at the right product. We need to think critically about how, when and why we\u2019re doing research. Everyone who makes products knows one thing: To make them awesome we have to talk to our users. It\u2019s how we understand their problems and how we make sure we\u2019re solving them. It\u2019s how we identify opportunities and how we validate them. It\u2019s integral to the way we work at Made by Many. But how do we make sure we\u2019re learning as much as we can from our users? And that we\u2019re applying what we\u2019ve heard in the right way? Here are three questions I like to ask before booking any user interviews: 1. What do you need to\u00a0learn? At the very start of a product\u2019s life this can be an enormous list\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re looking to uncover what we know, what we don\u2019t know and what we\u2019re not quite sure about. It can be things like: What\u2019s the biggest problem facing our potential customers? Who are our potential customers? How much might they pay for this? What even is this? Is this a good idea? What are they currently using to solve this problem? How do they feel whilst dealing with this problem? As we get further into a product\u2019s life, these questions can become more granular: Do users understand how this feature works? Do they like the name? Should it feel more like Snapchat or more like the New York Times? No matter what your questions are, it helps to get it all out there by working with your team to list all of your questions, assumptions and hypotheses\u200a\u2014\u200abefore leaping into your research. 2. What do you need to learn right\u00a0now? There\u2019s one question I always have in mind when planning research: \u201cWhat do we need to learn in order to make progress?\u201d Sometimes, we actually have everything we need to make the next step, in which case identifying that now is not the time to speak to users is a valuable realisation. More often we do have something to learn. These can be our biggest and riskiest questions; the things that are causing contention and long discussions in our team; or where we need more evidence to help decide between two divergent routes for our product. The important thing is that you should be clear about how you want to use whatever you want to learn in the short-term. The outcome of your research should be something that can immediately prompt action. It might take the form of insights, design principles, \u2018how might we\u2019 questions or just give us certainty that we\u2019re making the right decisions. Importantly, nobody wants to finish a round of research, only to still not know enough to make progress. Thinking about your learning objectives in this way can also help to ensure that you don\u2019t bite off too much at once. In most cases, the more focused your learning objectives are, the easier it\u2019s going to be to plan, conduct, make sense of and apply your research. 3. What\u2019s the best way to\u00a0learn? It\u2019s only after figuring out what you need to learn now, that you should start thinking about how you go about learning it. Picking a method could mean choosing between depth interviews, co-creation workshops, home visits or observational studies. Equally, it could mean thinking about meeting with experts, surveys, data analysis or multivariate testing. The right method will depend on the questions you\u2019re trying to answer. We have a whole arsenal of tools we can use in any given scenario\u200a\u2014\u200aand we should always be picking the right one for the job. Whatever you end up doing, or making, it\u2019s worth remembering that you\u2019re designing something to help you learn\u200a\u2014\u200anot what you think the full, final answer will be. This might manifest in pushing an idea to an extreme in order to get a reaction, or if you\u2019re making a prototype only focusing on enough of the experience to answer your questions. Focus on doing the minimum amount of work needed to learn, and remember that in many cases the thing you\u2019re making\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s a prototype, sketch, or simply a set of post-it notes to be sorted\u200a\u2014\u200ais just a prompt to conversation. One last\u00a0thing\u2026 Hopefully, at this point, you have a good idea of what you\u2019re trying to learn, and how you\u2019re going to apply that learning to turn it into action\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s always far less painful to think about how you\u2019ll be capturing your research ahead of time. Personally, in the case of user interviews, I\u2019ll nearly always capture verbatim notes as a starting point (with audio or video as a back up). You never know what unexpected things you might learn from seemingly irrelevant conversations. Just because you have a learning focus, doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t remain curious and open-minded about what you\u2019re hearing. Once you have the full notes\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ll then want to think about a structured way to approach interpreting your data. My preference is keeping things off screens, making it visual and getting everything up on a wall that allows you to sort, group and see patterns more easily. The important thing is, that by having an idea of how you\u2019ll approach your synthesis from the start, and knowing why you\u2019re doing it in the first place, you can make sure you\u2019re getting the most out of the time you\u2019ve invested in learning (and making your product awesome). Made by Many is a new type of consulting company that brings together product design, business strategy and software engineering as a unified discipline. For 10 years we\u2019ve been helping forward-looking companies to re-imagine their customer experiences, create new models for growth and build new capabilities. See our work.
