{"content": "The Rockets May Have Lost, but James Harden\u2019s Crossover Won The probable MVP showed off his signature move against the\u00a0Warriors The Rockets played the Warriors at home on Tuesday, in a clash with zero playoff implications. With a handful of games to go\u200a\u2014\u200aand barring supernatural, mathematically impossible collapses\u200a\u2014\u200athe 1\u20134 seeds in the Western Conference are locked up. San Antonio can light a fire under Golden State by winning out, but the latter closes with six of its last seven games at home, in Oracle Arena, where it\u2019s too loud to see. So Tuesday night\u2019s game was an opportunity for statements, and statements were made. The Warriors continued on looking a lot like their 2014\u201315 selves and, with some suspense, eventually won 113\u2013106. But this ain\u2019t \u2019bout that. Before we go any further, I want to ask for forgiveness. 2015 was a different time, and I was a different person. A few months ago, my colleague Shea Serrano named James Harden\u2019s signature move the Extend-o-Arms Drive, a dreadfully inevitable thing that occurs in three parts. While that last part\u200a\u2014\u200adragging the ball up through a thicket of swaying arms to somehow twist it in off the glass\u200a\u2014\u200ais the most infuriating, that first part\u200a\u2014\u200athe crossover that starts the drive\u200a\u2014\u200ais the most crucial. It\u2019s also the most mesmerizing, because it\u2019s both the fastest and slowest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Each time I watch it, I feel wrong-footed\u200a\u2014\u200aeven when I\u2019m sitting down\u200a\u2014\u200aand steam billows from my ears while my brain attempts to keep pace with my eyes. At least that\u2019s what happened when Harden put Draymond Green on an island in the first quarter. James Michael McAdoo batted away the layup attempt, but we\u2019re not going to complicate this appreciation with something as pointless as results. A hypothetical: If you had to guard James Harden one-on-one, do you think you could stop him from getting to the basket? I\u2019ll even give Harden ankle weights. Show of hands. Liars. A second hypothetical: If this matchup was to be filmed by smartphones from every possible angle and then immediately uploaded to YouTube for all posterity, would you even try? I wouldn\u2019t. Harden finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists for his 20th triple-double of the season, and did it all with a jammed left wrist.
