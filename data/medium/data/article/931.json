Rockefeller The irony of a strong financial life is that you don\u2019t really want it. You want what a strong financial life represents: options. But wealth is a weird thing. Like happiness and success, it can\u2019t be pursued directly. A lot of people try, but they\u2019re never satisfied. Once they make the money they used to think would make them happy, they find something else that\u2019s missing. Often times, it\u2019s just more money. It\u2019s what they know. Here are some things that people don\u2019t know about money. If you learn them, you\u2019ll have a leg up on how to build your wealth the right way. By the way, these aren\u2019t things that I created out of thin air. They\u2019re observations of how the natural laws of finance work. You can adapt any or all of them to your current situation with money and increase your chances of achieving the kind of financial state that widens the possibilities in your life. The question is, are you ready to start financially thriving? 1) Money is worthless by\u00a0itself Money is only valuable because it can get you something else you want. It\u2019s never an end goal. It\u2019s meant to touch many hands. Give it. Invest it. Save it for a rainy day if you don\u2019t have that set aside yet. Support a company or organization that\u2019s meaningful to you. Money was meant to be exchanged. Don\u2019t hoard it. Use it to connect with others more strongly than you could without. \u201cMoney is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and enlivens the other who turns it on his fellow man.\u201d\u2015Khalil Gibran 2) Smart money is\u00a0slow The best money managers in the world think slow before an action. Why? Because making better money decisions requires you to take pauses. You might believe otherwise if you\u2019ve watched movies like Wall Street. But what you\u2019re seeing is speculation, not investing. The best investments take time to play out, don\u2019t hinge on any single event or the success of one product, and are filled with ups and downs in the middle. Warren Buffett\u2019s slow to get in and even slower to get out. \u201cOur favorite holding period is forever.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWarren Buffett Great money management means first, breaking your old patterns with money like buying too much stuff or going out all the time, and then intentionally deciding on new ways to deal with it. It\u2019s hard. Let yourself slow down. 3) Making money is\u00a0boring We\u2019re only shown the dramatic, instant success stories of finance in the media, precisely because they\u2019re so unusual. You don\u2019t have to fall for it. For most individuals, making tons of money over a lifetime is like watching paint dry. Success is created and maintained by a thousand moves, all directed toward a long term goal. You save money bit by bit. You invest it. You receive dividends or income. You re-invest the proceeds, and compound your earnings year after year. It\u2019s no drama. I wish I could share a story with you about some famous person who became wealthy the boring way. But that would be everyone, so no one writes about it. 4) Money means saying\u00a0no Doing nothing is often the right thing to do. There are lots and lots of pretty shiny things begging for your money. Your future is worth more. Saying no to almost every opportunity to part with your money that comes your way is key to your financial success. Most of us waste what we have. The only exception to this rule is that you must say \u201cYes!\u201d with your whole heart to things that truly align with your core values, like supporting your kids\u2019 school if you think they do a great job, or investing in a business you believe in. The real work comes before the money moves here. It\u2019s important to come to terms with your deepest, truest goals in life, and align your financial actions accordingly. \u201cLearn to say \u2018No\u2019 to the good so you can say \u2018Yes\u2019 to the best.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn C. Maxwell 5) Money must be set\u00a0up Your attention is limited. There are only 24 hours a day, and they go fast. To become truly great at anything, you have to dedicate time and energy to it. If you don\u2019t have the time or interest to study money deeply, you\u2019ll need to get clear on your goals and automate your steps as much as possible. \u201cWealth is largely the result of habit.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn Jacob Astor Learn the basics. The worst thing would be to automate a process before you truly understand it. Big accidents tend to happen this way. Read the fine print once, then go. 6) Money requires a supportive environment Even if you\u2019ve learned the basics, gone on to change your habits, and decided which big goals you want your money to support, you\u2019ll fail if you surround yourself with people who don\u2019t support your new financial life. They\u2019ll tear down what you\u2019ve built up, not because they\u2019re terrible people, but because our environment deeply influences how we feel, think, and behave about everything. We\u2019re social creatures by nature. We want to fit in. \u201cExternal triggers come from the environment. Our five senses pick up on them, as well as our minds.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMarshall Goldsmith Many of the triggers that undermine our new goals happen in our subconscious, so you won\u2019t necessarily know why you\u2019re having such a hard time making them stick. Clear the decks if need be. See the friends who blow all their money more sparingly. Keep your focus on changing your financial life, and trust that you\u2019ll eventually attract awesome people who have similar values. The point of money is to magnify you. If you care about something, you get the opportunity to make more impact. If you love someone, you can give them more of what they need. You can share more. You can contribute more. You can invest in your future more. You get more options. Hit the \u2764 button if you liked this article! You\u2019ll help others find it.
