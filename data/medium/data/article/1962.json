{"child": "1962_11962_11962_1", "title": "Less Lazy", "content": "Less Lazy Or more talented? I get a daily email from Seth Godin. Not from him personally. We don\u2019t know each other. It\u2019s an automated email that I receive because I asked for it. I signed up for his daily blogging. Clear? I just didn\u2019t want you to think that I was name dropping (so, I was just talking with my buddy Seth, and he said\u2026) or bragging. Although I am kind of a big thing. Cue the fat jokes. So, I was reading my daily email from my buddy Seth and I saw a link that really resonated with me: More Recent\u00a0Articles Lazy but talented. Hm. Yaaa. I\u2019ll just go ahead and click on that\u2026 So I did. And I\u2019m glad. Because it really got me thinking. I\u2019ve been writing a number of posts recently about my writing, my writing challenges, about procrastination, planning, my issue(s) with log lines and like-minded ugh-why-doesn\u2019t-this-guy-just-stop-whining-and-get-on-with-the-writing-already posts. Most of them I\u2019ve attributed to fear. Something that, for some reason, is easier to admit to than, say, laziness. Because if I\u2019m just being lazy, that seems worse. Not being talented, or talented enough, is pretty scary, but an unholy marriage of Fear AND Laziness is even worse. It\u2019s a hard hole to dig out of. You can work really hard to get a little more talented. And you can also work to get a little less\u00a0lazy. It turns out that getting less lazy, more brave\u200a\u2014\u200amore clear about your fears, your work and your mission\u200a\u2014\u200aare all easier than getting more talented. (Seth Godin, if that wasn\u2019t obvious by\u00a0now) When you (read: Seth) lay it out like this, though, it provides some much-needed perspective. I can work really hard to get more talented. I can. But is that the right direction? Is that the best use of my time? Always trying to improve, always learning, is always good. But it\u2019s not the game changer. So, I can also work really hard on getting less lazy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s easier than getting more talented, to be honest, but I do feel that being clear about what I\u2019m afraid of, what I want to accomplish, and how, will help me get across the finish line. By being brave. Braver. Nothing worth doing is ever easy. Somebody said that. It wasn\u2019t me. Except for right now in this post. But it\u2019s true. Most amazing things, most incredible achievements (Editorial aside: I don\u2019t have the statistics or like-minded anecdotal information on hand to prove this, I just have to believe that this is true) couldn\u2019t have been easy to accomplish, or even undertake. They were hard. Writing isn\u2019t hard for me. Well, it isn\u2019t hard if I know what I want to write about. It isn\u2019t hard if I don\u2019t have to write a log line. Or an outline. Or actually start the book. Writing about the book is easy. The book? Not so much. So while writing in general isn\u2019t hard, writing something good, writing something important, writing those works-in-progress is very hard. Harder still when I\u2019m being lazy. And when I\u2019m being afraid. So I\u2019m going to be brave. Braver today than I was yesterday. Hopefully that translates into less lazy. It will still be hard. But it will be worth it.
