How many times have you written a sentence using a gender-neutral antecedent (the word a pronoun replaces) and stumbled? Which pronoun do you use\u200a\u2014\u200ahe or she? The Traditional Solution Until relatively recently, English grammarians asserted you use he as the gender-neutral pronoun with any antecedent. For example, if you use a non-gender-specific noun like \u201cscientist,\u201d \u201cjudge,\u201d \u201castronaut,\u201d or \u201cengineer,\u201d you use he as the accompanying pronoun in your sentence. Consider the following: Not to mention those nouns that have traditionally been associated more with women: Why it\u2019s\u00a0wrong This meant that millions of little girls were being subtly conditioned to believe that these were boys\u2019 things because of the masculine constructs. Plus, all those actual female judges, scientists, astronauts, engineers, teachers and nurses found it rather annoying being referred to as \u201che\u201d. Why should the male pronoun take precedence over the female? People tried to\u00a0change Then there was the awkward period when a singular antecedent was followed by the phrase he or she, him or her, or the even more awkward s/he. But this just clogged up our sentences and made them even more frustrating and irritating to read. The world is coming\u00a0around In 2015, Fowler\u2019s Dictionary of Modern English Usage finally called people out on gender-neutral pronoun consistency. Here\u2019s the gist of their conclusion: \u201cFrom the earliest times until about the 1960s it was unquestionably acceptable to use the pronoun he (and him, himself, his) with indefinite reference to denote a person of either sex, especially after indefinite pronouns and determiners such as anybody,\u00a0\u2026 every, etc., after gender-neutral nouns such as person\u00a0\u2026 but alternative devices are now usually resorted to. When a gender-neutral pronoun or determiner\u00a0\u2026 is needed, the options usually adopted are the plural forms they, their, themselves, etc., or he or she (his or her, etc.)\u201d So, that means these options are valid: What are other professional writers\u00a0doing? Newspaper reporters, those who are heavily invested in writing compelling, concise, and engaging prose, use they and their as the pronoun for a gender-neutral antecedent. Wikipedia lists several influential newspapers like the London Sunday Times, The Guardian and US News & World Report switching to they and their to express gender neutrality. Certain style guides like The Chicago Manual of Style recommend using they and their. Others suggest a rewrite to avoid these situations altogether. For example: We think this might be the best options when it\u2019s possible. Rewrite the sentence so that the problem goes away. You are writers, aren\u2019t you? Rewrite. Final thoughts The Chicago Manual of Style sums up the quandary best: \u201cGender bias\u00a0\u2026 On the one hand, it is unacceptable to a great many reasonable readers to use the generic masculine pronoun (he in reference to no one in particular). On the other hand, it is unacceptable to a great many readers (often different readers) either to resort to non-traditional gimmicks to avoid the generic masculine (by using he/she or s/he, for example) or to use they as a kind of singular pronoun. Either way, credibility is lost with some readers.\u201d We\u2019re going to take a stand though: And if you just can\u2019t face it, rewrite the sentence so that the problem goes away.
