What is the F-Pattern and how it\u00a0works? The F-Pattern describes the most common user eye-scanning patterns when it comes to blocks of content. F for fast. That\u2019s how users read your content. In a few seconds, their eyes move at amazing speeds across your website\u0092s page. The pattern was popularized by NNGroup eyetracking study which recorded more than 200 users looked at thousands of web pages and found that users\u2019 main reading behavior was fairly consistent across many different sites and tasks. This reading pattern looked somewhat like an F and has the following three components: Our eyes are trained to start at the top-left corner, scan horizontally, then drop down to the next line and do the same until we find something of interest. The NNGroup demonstrates how eye-tracking studies revealed that users (in left-to-right reading cultures) typically scan heavy blocks of content in a pattern that looks like the letter F or E. The areas where users looked the most are colored red; the yellow areas indicate fewer views, followed by the least-viewed blue areas. Gray areas didn\u2019t attract any fixations. Obviously, users\u2019 scan patterns are not always comprised of exactly three parts. When the reader finds something they like, they begin reading normally, forming horizontal lines. Why should I use\u00a0it? F-shaped pattern will help you create a design with good visual hierarchy, a design that people can scan easily. F-shaped layout feels comfortable for the most western readers, because they have been reading top to bottom, left to right for their entire lives. When should I use\u00a0it? The F-pattern is the go-to layout for text-heavy websites like blogs and news sites. If there is a lot of content\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially text\u200a\u2014\u200ausers will respond better with the layout that designed according to the natural scanning format. CNN uses the F-Shapen\u00a0pattern How to use F-Shapen\u00a0pattern F-Layout literally gives the designer more control over what gets seen. Prioritize your\u00a0content Before arranging the elements on your page, prioritize the most and least important ones. Once you know what you want your users to see, you can simply place them in the pattern\u2019s \u2018hot spots\u2019 for the right interactions. Set initial expectations The first two paragraphs are the most important. Place the most important content near to the top of the page as possible in an attempt to communicate the site\u2019s (or page) purpose quickly. The user will usually read horizontally across the header, so here\u2019s a good place for a navigation bar. The most important content on this page can be seen in a few seconds. Image credits:\u00a0tutsplus Design for scanning, not\u00a0reading When applying the pattern think scanners and place content these scanners would most likely be interested in along the F: Utilize the\u00a0sidebar Sidebar exists to get users involved in a deeper level, so use it to drive user engagement: Medium placing a sub-navigation in\u00a0sidebar. Avoid boring\u00a0layouts The main drawback to this F-shapen layout is its predisposition to monotony. It\u2019s easy to bore your users with repetitive and similar content in rows. You certainly don\u2019t benefit from a bored user if they begin to dull everything out, so add one \u201cawkward\u201d element within the scanning area to keep the user engaged. Image credit:\u00a0tutsplus This technique of \u201cbreaking the expectations\u201d of the layout can be useful when you have really long vertical spans of content that feel dull or boring once you scroll past the first couple sections. Conclusion F-shapen pattern simply follows the common trends of the human eye so that you can optimize the structure of your layout. But you don\u2019t need to follow it rigidly\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a guideline, not a template. Thank you!
