{"name": "1287", "parent": "", "content": "Let the Buyer\u00a0Beware Source Every Christmas season, the braver residents of Norwich purchased a special gift for themselves. They visited the witch Celestia\u2019s cottage, and they bought one of her handmade calendars. Celestia wove the covers from unicorn hair, painted each calendar using pigments made from powdered faerie wings, and stitched them together with threads taken from the garments of her magical ancestors. Those were the rumors, anyhow. But however the calendars were made, their pages were what mattered to the buyers. For Celestia\u2019s calendars came already marked with significant upcoming dates in the lives of their purchasers. You might open your calendar on Christmas morning and learn that on July 18 of the upcoming year, you would meet your soulmate. Or you might discover that on September 10, you would bear, or sire, a child. (Of course, depending on one\u2019s life circumstances, such a revelation could prove more awkward than thrilling.) Perhaps you would see nothing special marked for any month. This might be disappointing, but it was not necessarily the worst outcome. There was a type of calendar nobody ever wanted to get: One that was incomplete. For if a calendar broke off after a specific date, that meant only one thing. Celestia insisted that she simply made the calendars, and Fate imprinted them. She wrapped them herself before selling them, so there was no possibility of anyone picking through them in the hopes of finding an especially fortunate one. Let the buyer beware, she said. Some villagers simply refused to buy her calendars. It was best not to know these things in advance and simply accept life as it happened, they reasoned. But Celestia still made plenty of money. Daniel and his brother Graham had been buying Celestia\u2019s calendars ever since they reached adulthood. Over the years, Daniel became increasingly less fond of this ritual. Graham\u2019s calendars invariably promised wonderful things that always came to pass. He married a bright, beautiful woman. His business prospered. He and his wife had two well-behaved and lovely children. Daniel\u2019s calendars showed him dismal things: the day he would lose his job, or the day that the love of his life would leave him for someone else. And those, too, happened just as they were written. He rather understandably lost all interest in purchasing another calendar and announced he wouldn\u2019t be bothering with one this year, but Graham wouldn\u2019t hear of it. \u201cBrother, life will turn around for you eventually. And it\u2019s good to know these things so you can plan for them.\u201d Daniel thought that was awfully easy for Graham to say, but Graham would not be denied. The brothers made the trek to Celestia\u2019s cottage and purchased their new calendars. Graham always invited Daniel to stay with his family for Christmas, as their parents had died several years prior and Daniel would otherwise be alone. It was a tradition to open their calendars on Christmas morning, but after Graham and his family went to bed on Christmas Eve, Daniel stole down to the Christmas tree and carefully unwrapped his calendar, trying not to crinkle the paper and alert anyone. When he opened his calendar, which was painted in hues of shimmering purple and blue, he felt it right away. Something was different. He discovered only too soon what the difference was: The calendar stopped on June 9th, and there were no more pages. Rage and terror fought a battle within Daniel\u2019s soul. How could this be? He was barely thirty. He deserved far more time than this. Willing his hands to stop shaking, he found Graham\u2019s calendar and unwrapped it. Graham\u2019s calendar, painted in vivid silvers and golds, was complete, and it featured more money and more auspicious meetings for him, as if he hadn\u2019t already had enough good fortune. It did note that he would suffer the painful loss of his brother on June 9th. Well, I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m considered a painful loss, said a sour voice inside Daniel\u2019s head. And with that, rage won the battle. This was all deeply unfair. Graham had gotten so much already, and Daniel so little. Daniel had consumed a good bit of Graham\u2019s fine wine at dinner that night, and perhaps that contributed to his next idea. He rewrapped the calendars and switched the name tags. He had no idea if this would work, but in his drunken and spiteful state, it seemed worth a try. Did it bother him that this act might be condemning his brother to death? If it did, he reasoned that his brother often seemed rather smug about all the good fortune he\u2019d had. Now it was Daniel\u2019s turn for a break. Christmas morning was a horribly sad affair after Graham unwrapped his calendar. He flipped through the purple and blue pages, turned as pale as milk when he came to the abbreviated June, and motioned for his wife Christina to join him in the kitchen, away from the children. But her howls of sorrow made the situation quite clear. Daniel thought to conceal his guilt by carrying on with the subtlety of a bad actor when Graham gave him the news. He collapsed to the floor, making the house shake and further upsetting Graham\u2019s children. \u201cThere must be a terrible mistake, brother dear.\u201d He delivered that line with particular conviction. And then, getting a bit carried away, he announced \u201cSwap calendars with me! You\u2019ve got so much more to live for than I do.\u201d He felt like an idiot the second that one came out of his mouth, and he was more than a bit insulted by how long Graham seemed to consider that idea before shaking his head and saying that one\u2019s fate simply couldn\u2019t be changed so easily. That\u2019s what you think, brother. Graham resolved to live the rest of his days with vigor and joy rather than cower in his home waiting for Death. June 9th came far too soon, and in the late afternoon, Graham\u2019s favorite horse threw her master off after a sudden noise startled her. The impact killed Graham instantly. Daniel went to bed that night with no brother, but with his life. He had gotten away with the switch. Or so he believed at first. On the day after Graham\u2019s death, Daniel thought he must be coming down with some peculiar illness. His stomach felt as if a knot of ice had formed in its center. The chill spread through Daniel\u2019s body in defiance of the warm summer weather as the days progressed. It froze out his appetite. When Daniel looked at himself in the mirror to see if he had any visible signs of illness\u200a\u2014\u200apox marks or an oddly-colored tongue, perhaps\u200a\u2014\u200ahe realized he could barely see himself. He looked transparent, a mere shadowed outline. And after a few more days, nobody could see or hear Daniel at all. He still saw a faint reflection in the mirror and heard his own voice, but he could stand naked next to someone and shout swear words at the top of his lungs and get no reaction. He hadn\u2019t died on June 9th, but he might as well have. Having no idea what else to do, he went to Celestia\u2019s cottage, hoping that perhaps she could still see him and treat this bizarre affliction. The odors of sulfur and burnt wood wafted past Daniel as the ancient witch opened her door to him. She looked him up and down with filmy hazel eyes, raised a bushy eyebrow, and got straight to the point: \u201cYou switched with someone. Who was it?\u201d \u201cI did no such thing,\u201d Daniel said. Celestia thwacked him on the arm with the spell book she held. \u201cDon\u2019t dare lie to me, idiot boy. There is only one way a body gets into the state you\u2019re in right now. Who did you give your calendar to?\u201d Daniel had the good sense to look at the wooden floor in shame. \u201cMy brother.\u201d Celestia stared at him for a moment and then threw her head back and howled with bitter laughter. \u201cAnd people call me wicked? My word.\u201d Daniel\u2019s ears burned. \u201cLook, I know it was a terrible thing to do\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c \u201cOh, do you now?\u201d That sent her off into more gales of hateful mirth. \u201cBut it\u2019s done. He\u2019s gone. Can\u2019t you help me?\u201d She let out one last great snort before fixing him with a look that froze his insides anew. \u201cAs I tell people year after year, I make the calendars. I\u2019m not responsible for what they have in store for you. And if you attempt to cheat fate with sneaky tricks, you deserve what happens next. Even if I could fix you, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t go on like this!\u201d \u201cYou have no choice.\u201d Celestia\u2019s voice held no compassion. \u201cPlease,\u201d Daniel said, his voice breaking. \u201cI know I did an awful thing, but I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to my brother\u2019s family if only you undo this.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cThen I\u2019ll stay here and haunt you every day until you figure out a cure.\u201d At that, she seized a gnarled wooden wand from her apron pocket. \u201cThe hell you will,\u201d she said, blasting him straight out of the cottage with a great crackling red bolt of energy. He was unable to approach her home again. For years afterwards, he attempted to frighten off the people buying Celestia\u2019s calendars. Sometimes a visitor would look around for a few seconds, as if they felt or heard something odd, but this was never enough to stop them. Graham\u2019s family survived their devastating loss and lived happy lives. Daniel floats around Norwich to this day, with only the shades of others who attempted to cheat fate for company. With all the time he has had to reflect on the past, he wishes he had kept his own calendar.
