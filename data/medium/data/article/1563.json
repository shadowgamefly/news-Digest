CREDIT: Screenshot, CSPAN Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) stepped onto the Senate floor around 6:45 pm Tuesday night to begin a marathon speech in protest of President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. Fifteen and a half hours later, he left. \u201cBy stealing a Supreme Court seat for the first time in American history, the Senate is undermining the Court and the rule of law, and turning the highest court in the land into a political committee,\u201d Merkley wrote on his Facebook page before taking the floor. Merkley pledged on Twitter a few hours into his speech to keep talking \u201cas long as I\u2019m able.\u201d His staff told an ABC reporter that he ran an Ironman Triathalon in November, and that \u201cif anyone can keep going, he can.\u201d But Merkley couldn\u2019t keep talking forever, even if he had unlimited endurance. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) preemptively filed a motion to end debate, known as a cloture motion, before Merkley started talking. That motion starts a clock for votes on cloture, which is one of the few things that Senate rules allow to interrupt a marathon speech like Merkley\u2019s. That means that while Merkley could use his speech to draw attention and as a symbolic protest, he couldn\u2019t actually delay the vote on Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation (and it also means that, technically, his speech wasn\u2019t a filibuster). The vote on cloture for Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation is expected on Thursday, and a full vote is expected in the Senate before it breaks for two weeks for Easter on Friday. Senate Republicans are expected to use the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200agetting rid of the 60-vote nomination threshold\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to get Gorsuch passed in the face of near-complete Democratic opposition. McConnell announced his intention to do so as Merkley took the floor. Merkley\u2019s speech ranged widely over the night. He riffed on Republicans\u2019 refusal to hold votes on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland, as they argued there was historic precedence for holding off during an election year. \u201cThat is a phony, phony, incorrect, salacious, insert-your-own-adjective-there argument,\u201d Merkley said, listing out the history of four times SCOTUS nominees have been confirmed in election years. Merkley also drew ammunition from breaking events outside the Capitol building. While he was on the floor, news broke that Gorsuch\u2019s 2006 books contains passages that are strikingly similar to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. The White House dismissed the news, but several academics and experts told Politico that the similarities between the passages would almost certainly violate academic plagiarism rules. Just after midnight, Merkley was handed a copy of the Politico report and recited several of the allegedly plagiarized passages. Even later in the night, Merkley went on a riff about the dangers of money in politics and Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that enabled private interests to pour \u201ca flow of largely secret money concentrated in the hands of the megawealthy into campaigns,\u201d as he put it. \u201cYou can see this corrupting power by looking at the disappearance of the interests of my colleagues across the aisle in the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Richard Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. And many colleagues expressed a lot of interest in taking on one of the most diabolical sources of pollution\u200a\u2014\u200acarbon dioxide. But that interest has completely disappeared since the fossil fuel industry has put billions of dollars into the Republican Senate Campaigns. Completely disappeared.\u201d After listing off concrete examples of recent and impending environmental disasters linked to climate change\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the longer wildfire season in Oregon to coral bleaching caused by ocean acidification\u200a\u2014\u200aMerkley circled back to money in politics corrupting the political response. \u201cWe are doing so little because the coal and oil billionaires have proceeded to invest so much money in third-party Senate campaigns to elect one side of the aisle and defeat the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fossil fuel cartel wants to make sure they have a court that continues this corruption, and that\u2019s why they put so much pressure to have senators not consider Merrick Garland when he was nominated last year in 2016.\u201d Merkley yielded the floor at 10:15 am on Wednesday, after 15 and a half hours of speaking.
