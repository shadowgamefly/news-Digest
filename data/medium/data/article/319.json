{"name": "319", "parent": "", "content": "I Have 15 ideas To Change Your Life. Do you Have 5\u00a0Minutes? I\u2019m the last person to say that life is easy. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. But there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in recent years that changed everything. They way you THINK determines the outcome of your life. But thinking is hard. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t do it often enough. Helen Keller said it best: \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to think, if one thinks, one must reach conclusions. Conclusions are not always pleasant.\u201d I\u2019ll show you 15 thoughts about life that will forever transform the way you live. Ready? Let\u2019s go. 1: Think big, act\u00a0small Want to build a big company? Change people\u2019s lives? Make a contribution to the world? Earn a million bucks? Never let anything hold you back when you think of ideas. So what? You might as well aim high. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Just make sure you act small. Put in the work and stay practical. All you need is one big win anyway. But when you aim low, the outcome is always low. 2: Problems are unanswered questions I don\u2019t get why people freak out when they encounter a problem. \u201cThis is the worst thing ever!\u201d Every time you experience stress over a problem, you\u2019re basically sabotaging your life. It\u2019s completely unnecessary to ever freak out. Remember this: A problem is nothing but an unanswered question. So stay calm. And figure out the answer. 3: Build relationships on a firm foundation Here are some wrong reasons to be in a relationship: Money, fear of being alone, abuse, needing attention. If your relationship sucks, and you\u2019ve tried to improve it multiple times, it\u2019s time to move on. Love has no opposite. When you love someone, you can\u2019t hate them at the same time. The foundation of all relationships should be based on: Love, respect, support, trust, patience, good company, laughter, sadness, and more support. 4: Nothing in life is\u00a0free No matter how you spin it, you always pay for something with money, time (the most valuable thing you have), or other resources. Life is business. And smart business people spend their resources wisely. How? Be calculated. Never waste resources (especially time). 5: Never be afraid of making decisions You might think that making no decision at all can do no harm, but you\u2019re wrong. The worst thing about making decisions is when you don\u2019t pull the trigger. Waiting, postponing, doubting, researching too much\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s all not useful. Get your act together, and decide firmly whenever you have to make one. And when you made the wrong decision, apologize, and make another decision. 6: Decide to become a leader\u00a0today Sometimes you\u2019re a leader, sometimes you\u2019re a follower. You can be a leader at work, and a follower at home. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And being a leader also has nothing to do with your title. You know what is wrong? When everyone looks at each other because no one wants to take responsibility. Decide that you will take responsibility. There you go: You\u2019re a leader now. 7: Productivity yields\u00a0results There\u2019s only one thing that helps you to go from nothing to something: Work. I don\u2019t care how smart you work, you still have to put in the work. Just make sure you value effectiveness over everything. Results matter. Get things done and move on to the next thing. 8: See yourself as a salesperson Everyone is a salesperson. When you\u2019re dating, you\u2019re selling yourself. Same is true when you\u2019re applying for a job. When you sell, be transparent, honest, and to the point. Don\u2019t waste your time on people who don\u2019t like you anyway. Sales is not about how many people don\u2019t want you or your product. It\u2019s about finding the people who do. 9: If you want to improve your self-confidence, improve your\u00a0skills If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, don\u2019t try to search for it in motivational posts, talks, or books. You only improve your self-confidence by becoming good at something. How do you get good? By learning, doing, seeing results, and repeating that process for years. Your confidence will grow slowly every day. 10: Value your\u00a0friends We\u2019re social animals. When we\u2019re alone, we die early. You might think you don\u2019t need friends, but you do. So be nice to each other. And respect that your friends also have lives of their own. Especially when you grow older, and have more responsibilities (and less time). Things change. People also change. But the connection stays. 11: Don\u2019t believe everything you\u00a0see We live in a \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d world. Everyone wants to be famous and they do everything to keep up appearances. Don\u2019t believe all the success stories you see everywhere. YouTubers, Instagram models, millionaire entrepreneurs: They seem perfect. But you only see the outside. You don\u2019t have to be a cynic. Just don\u2019t take appearances for facts. 12: Learn to love criticism When someone takes the time to give you criticism, you should be thankful. Why? It\u2019s fuel for you. You can use criticism to improve yourself, your product, or your service. Or, if the criticism makes no sense, it can make you angry, which is also a good thing. That type of anger is useful. \u201cI\u2019ll show them!\u201d Never be a wimp. Take criticism like a champ. 13: If you can\u2019t take care of your body, you can\u2019t take care of\u00a0anything Whether you like it or not, you don\u2019t fully control your health. You can only influence it by eating healthy, exercising, and not using your body as a toilet. Just get off your ass and get moving, you lazy mofo. And I\u2019m not talking about keeping it up for a few days. No, do it every single day of your healthy life. Because if you can\u2019t do that, what can you do? See it as practice for the difficult times of life because the stronger you are, the better. 14: Happiness is a\u00a0choice You control your thoughts. That means you decide what you do with your life. If you\u2019re unsatisfied, angry, or frustrated, that\u2019s all you. I always thought: \u201cI can never be happy. I need to be rich, own a fancy car, and buy a big house.\u201d But I was thinking all wrong. You can be happy with your current life. All it takes is a decision. And when it improves, you\u2019ll still be happy. 15: Create something When you create something (doesn\u2019t matter what it is), you\u2019re actively doing something. You either solve a problem or entertain people. So instead of consuming so much information, products, and entertainment from others, spend a fraction of that time on creating something yourself. You don\u2019t have to create something by yourself, you can also do it with others. No matter what you do: Make yourself useful. So don\u2019t just sit there and read another article; go out and do something. What are you still doing here anyway? Go on already! Thanks for reading!
