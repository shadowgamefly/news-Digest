{"content": "4 Things Wrong With\u00a0Slack Fundamental problems with real-time chatter Slack and I have always had a love-hate relationship. Slack provides a seamless way to keep in touch, providing real-time functions to interact with those in your team. As a heavy user, I\u2019ve had both positive and negative experiences. Even as a remote worker, Slack can be very damaging to your productivity with day-to-day work. I wanted to document a few issues that I\u2019ve been having with Slack to help highlight some solutions but issues that I believe need to be fixed to help progress with real-time communication methods. 1. Destructive Real-time Messaging Real-time messaging on Slack is like being on a busy street. Noisy, and continually busy. Continually checking in or switching on notifications can be damaging to your productive flow when doing an intensive piece of work. Summed up beautifully in this tweet below from Cabel Sasser. One way to get around this is eliminating messages coming in. Hit the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d button and you have the option to schedule around your busy \u201cwork\u201d time and the free time you have, so no notifications come through. There is a curve ball here though. Team members, if urgent, can bypass this option. By flagging the message as urgent, a push notification will send an alert regardless of the DND mode. Judge this feature as you may, but the issue with Slack does revolve around access to other\u2019s through real-time time. 2. Out of\u00a0Storage! Storage is a huge issue with Slack. Although all services have to make some cash, of course, the storage is just 10,000 messages for the free tier. If you have a team of 5 or above, this will go in no time. History won\u2019t be stored and any message from the past will be archived, or deleted. The other day, I wanted to see some of the first messages we sent on Slack for a startup I work with, and everything was gone. The most annoying thing about this experience is the messages. Try uploading when you are out of storage, you\u2019ll get pinged back about the storage limit being hit. This is painful, as the notification will distract you, for sure and leave a nice red notification button on your Slack app. 3. Tonnes of new\u00a0Inboxes As you already know from using Slack, it quickly becomes your 2nd inbox. The benefit to inboxes is the ability to see everything in one space. A read by David Allen documents this well. In GTD, Getting Things Done, he states to have as few inboxes as possible and to \u201cchannel\u201d your efforts/items into one or as few apps/services as possible. Slack\u2019s additional feed adds another layer of inbox! CTRL+K is the tool you need to flick channels on Slack, but even the master skills can\u2019t keep up with the pace of new messages coming in. Getting lost is easy inside of Slack, 5-minutes of checking messages turns into 20-minutes of speaking about irrelevant subjects. Despite the introduction of the new \u201cunread\u201d feed\u200a\u2014\u200aunderstanding the context of each unread message requires jumping into the channel which might mean you get lost once again. Try getting \u201cunread\u201d messages sent to your inbox to avoid any in-evening distraction, documented below. 4. Outside of\u00a0work! Responding to Slack messages after work hours can dominate those in-movie moments at home. It\u2019s nothing different from email. The disadvantage will Slack is that despite having the \u201cAWAY\u201d activated, the messages still pour through with no regard to your environment. For those who enjoy out of hours free time, this interference damages attention and adds to your inbox load. Again, something to consider as a big picture when communicating with people on Slack. Slack is one of the main services I use across my day and by no means do I intend to replace it, just yet. I understand the value of direct messages, and use them myself. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below on your Slack experience so far. If you think the hustle and bustle of Slack is too much too handle, why not give Newton a try? Powerful features like Read Receipts, Send Later, Snooze & more coupled with a clean, stress-free interface will surely give you some Inbox peace.
