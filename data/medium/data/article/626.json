{"name": "626", "parent": "", "content": "25 Habits That Will Make You a\u00a0Writer Hard learned lessons distilled from 25 years of\u00a0writing 1. Write every\u00a0day. A daily writing habit is thing number one because it is THAT important. Move your story forward by even a few words every single day and you\u2019ll be surprised by what happens. Or maybe not, since what will happen is this: you\u2019ll write a book. 2. Read like a\u00a0writer. Stephen King says that if you don\u2019t have time to read, you don\u2019t have the time or tools to write. You know he\u2019s right. Make it a habit to carry a book with you. Keep one in your bathroom. Learn to read in sips instead of gulps\u200a\u2014\u200aso that not having hours to indulge won\u2019t keep you from reading at all. And read like a writer. Pay attention to what works and what doesn\u2019t. Read craft books. Read fiction (for sure, read fiction) that does what you want your stories to do. What works? What doesn\u2019t? (Most important) WHY? 3. Watch TV like\u00a0writer. I\u2019ve written before about my absolute belief that if you want to be a writer, you need to be watching television. I still believe it. Some of the best writing and story telling is happening on television. Just like with reading, watch like a writer. Pay attention to why you like a show, why you\u2019re willing to invest hours of your life in it. And why you\u2019re not, if you turn it off at the first commercial break and never come back. If You Want to be A Writer, You Should be Watching TV. Here\u2019s Why.My daughter Ruby and I have this ritual. Twice a week, as we drive home from soccer practice, we listen to Delilah on\u2026medium.com 4. Watch movies like a\u00a0writer. Ray Bradbury advised people who want to be writers to watch a lot of movies. He advises old movies. I watch a movie in a theater at least once a week ($5 Tuesdays! I\u2019m seeing Ghost in the Shell tonight. Last week was The Power Rangers.) A movie is a way to get an entire story in two hours. And writers should be story junkies. Pay attention to the structure of a movie, how its paced, which parts work for you and which don\u2019t. 5. Set up your\u00a0space. You need a place where your brain instantly knows it\u2019s writing time. For me, it\u2019s a corner of my den, right off the kitchen. I wish I had a whole room, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve lived in apartments so small and full of people that my writing place was a lap desk that I used while sitting in my bed. That\u2019s okay, too. So is your kitchen table or Starbucks or the library or a cooperative work space or a straight up office. Where ever it is, train your brain to shift into writer mode when you are there. 6. Find your\u00a0tribe. Seek out other writers. They\u2019re your people. Find them online (come be a Ninja Writer), at writer\u2019s conferences, take classes, join an in-person writing group. Being around other writers will help you to internalize the idea that you\u2019re one, too. 7. Write for one\u00a0reader. The inverse of finding your tribe is this: don\u2019t try to write for them. Writing for a whole group of people is crazy-making. Writing and reading are too subjective for that. So pick a person\u200a\u2014\u200ajust one\u200a\u2014\u200aand write for them. If they like what you\u2019ve written, then that\u2019s good enough. You\u2019ve done your job. You can get other opinions then, use other beta readers, but contradictory advice can be filtered out. 8. Set boundaries with your friends and\u00a0family. Your writing is important. It\u2019s your job, even if you\u2019re months or years from any tangible proof that other people will understand. Set your writing schedule and then protect it like you\u2019d protect any other work schedule. It\u2019s okay to say NO to interruptions. 9. Write like it\u2019s your\u00a0job. Let\u2019s dive deeper into this one. If writing is your job, then you\u2019ll do a few things: You\u2019ll invest time in it. You\u2019ll put effort into learning to do it well. You\u2019ll finish what you start. You\u2019ll expect other people to respect your work. Do all of that. 10. Write with the door\u00a0closed. I see this happen all the time. Writer\u2019s often know what the beginning and the end of their stories are, but the middle (which is actually half of the whole book), gets murky. So they start asking opinions. They reach out to their tribes and say something like: I\u2019m not sure where to go with this story, what do you think? Your tribe is important enough that it gets it\u2019s own item on this list, but your story is YOURS until you\u2019re ready for readers. And then it becomes theirs. Don\u2019t let it be theirs until you\u2019re done with it. You\u2019ll thank me later. You know. When you actually finish writing a book. 11. Learn to self-edit. Self-editing is as important as writing. You have to learn to do it. If you have this thought in your mind, banish it right now: I don\u2019t need to have good spelling/grammar/comma usage\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that\u2019s what editors are for. Just. No. If you\u2019re going the traditional route, you\u2019ll never get close to an editor without a very clean manuscript. If you\u2019re going indie, then YOU are going to have to pay someone to be your editor. You\u2019ll save money and time and embarrassment if you turn in a clean copy to your editor. That you\u2019re paying. Self-Editing for Fiction Writers by Renni Browne and Dave King is an excellent place to start. It was like a master class is editing for me. 12. Save your pennies for a real edit and a professional cover, if you\u2019re going\u00a0indie. This is non-negotiable. If you wouldn\u2019t be okay with Penguin releasing your novel with your best friend\u2019s edit and your own homemade cover, then YOU can\u2019t be okay with it either. If you\u2019re planning to self-publish that means you\u2019re a PUBLISHER. A professional publisher. And that means that you have to find and hire an editor and a cover designer for your book, and if you don\u2019t know how to do it yourself, probably a book designer as well. Plan on spending about $1500 and start saving your pennies. The hope is that your first book will pay for your second. 13. Ship. A\u00a0lot. It\u2019s very rare for someone to write one book and have it be something that looks like a career. Don\u2019t talk to me about Harper Lee or J.K. Rowling. They aren\u2019t normal people. They\u2019re unicorns. Maybe you\u2019re a unicorn, too, but the chances are about 99.9999 percent that you\u2019re a regular old donkey like the rest of us. And that means that you have to keep writing and keep shipping your book out to the world. 14. Give your career ten\u00a0books. That brings us to how much you need to ship. Don\u2019t ship one book and when it doesn\u2019t hit the bestseller list, give up. Instead, write ten or twenty really good books. And keep writing. You\u2019ll see the momentum pick up. This is one of my favorite writing advice posts. It\u2019s from Hugh Howey. He says: Five years from now, these pros will have 10\u201320 works available. They only need to sell 250\u2013500 books a month to earn a supplemental income. Ten books a day across twenty titles. That\u2019s the longterm goal. 15. Read these\u00a0books. On Writing by Stephen KingThe Writer\u2019s Journey by Christopher VoglerSelf-Editing for Fiction Writers by Renni Browne and Dave KingZen in the Art of Writing by Ray BradburyThe Kick-Ass Writer by Chuck WendigBird by Bird by Anne LamottStory Genius by Lisa Cron 16. Set teeny, tiny\u00a0goals. I write about this a lot. Teeny tiny goals are life changers. You can get anywhere if you take one little step at a time. So set a goal that is so small it\u2019s harder to skip it than it is to just do it. My go to is ten minutes. Write ten minutes a day. Read ten minutes a day. You\u2019ll see. Here\u2019s a whole framework I use: How to be a good writer with a good lifeThe WRITER Frameworkmedium.com 17. Give yourself gold\u00a0stars. This is one of the most simple and simply effective things ever. It works for everyone, from Kindergarten up. Get yourself a calendar. Set your teeny, tiny goal. Meet your goal. Give yourself a gold star on your calendar. (Or, if you\u2019re way too cool for stars, just get a Sharpie and give yourself a nice big X.) A visual representation of a string of successes will push you toward maintaining the streak. You\u2019ll see. Here\u2019s what I use. I call it FRED. How to Use a Notebook to Reach Your Writing GoalsFRED will help you finish your novelwritingcooperative.com 18. Call yourself a\u00a0writer. Just trust me. Say this out loud today: I am a writer. The next time someone asks you what you do, say: I am a writer. I don\u2019t care what your day job is. Start identifying as a writer. It\u2019ll be hard at first, if you\u2019ve never done it before, but you\u2019ll get used to it. If you\u2019re writing every day, you\u2019re a writer. You\u2019re allowed to own that. 19. FINISH This one is all-caps important. There isn\u2019t a whole lot you can do toward becoming a writer if you don\u2019t finish a manuscript. Your writer brain will throw up shiny new ideas when the going gets rough on your current work-in-progress. Write them down, but stay focused on your story. Remember when it was your shiny new idea and keep writing. Get all the way to the end. 20. Make your day job serve your\u00a0art. This is a shift in thinking that will change everything for you. Start thinking about your day job as something you do in service of writing. Your 9-to-5 pays the bills for your writing. It gives you the pennies to save for an editor and cover designer. 21. Build an email\u00a0list. I wish, so much, that when my first books were picked up by a big publisher, they\u2019d taken the time to tell me that I needed to build an audience and then teach me how to do it. The fact is that I\u2019m not sure they know how. No one tells fiction writers how important an email list is. So I\u2019m going to tell you: it\u2019s very important. Start now. Even if you\u2019ve never written a book. Start writing on Medium or on your own blog. Publish something once a week and put a form from upscri.be at the bottom. 22. Make a five year\u00a0plan. Actually, break it down. Write goals for where you want your writing career to be in: 3 months6 months1 year3 years5 years These are stepping stones. It\u2019ll be much easier to think about getting to \u201cwrite three short stories and have 50 people on my email list in three months\u201d than it is to think about some huge end goal. I\u2019ve been a professional writer for 20 years. I have two books traditionally published and I\u2019m at the bare beginnings of exploring being an indie (or maybe hybrid) author. Here\u2019s what my five year plan looks like: 3 months: Get to 25,000 on my email list and launch WASTED (YA adventure.)\u00a06 months: Get to 50,000 on my email list and launch 32-B (YA science fiction adventure.)1 year: Get to 100,000 on my email list and launch THUNDERSTRUCK (romance.) Make a decision about whether or not to indie publish WONDER ROO (middle grade magical realism.)3 years: Have 10 total titles indie published.\u00a05 years: Earn enough money from fiction to support my family. ($5000 month.) 23. Keep an editorial calendar. An editorial calendar is a simple tool that will help you stay on track as you move through your five year plan. I was a newspaper reporter when I was younger and an editorial calendar was absolutely essential to my job. I just never lost the taste for having one. I keep an analog editorial calendar, because I\u2019m just an analog girl. You can keep one online, too. Just make deadlines for yourself. Keep track of your writing goals. I actually use my FRED to manage my novel writing. I keep track of my word count and also keep a daily log of my work. FRED is the most effective accountability partner I\u2019ve ever had. I use a monthly planner for non-fiction writing, which is mainly blog posts and Medium posts. It looks like this: I write the home for the post in a circle and cross it when I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t personally need to write in the titles of my posts or plan which post I\u2019m going to write ahead of time, so I don\u2019t. I do keep track on the weekly pages of things like which posts I cross-posted to my blog or to Medium, so I\u2019m less likely to accidentally duplicate. I also keep a running list of story ideas in my editorial calendar. 24. Be Interesting. This is a mistake I see a lot of newbie fiction writers make, especially if they\u2019ve just signed with an agent or sold a manuscript: they dive into social media with a hard focus on their fiction writing. If you\u2019re not a unicorn, no one cares about your writing process. That goes for me, too. Instead of Tweeting #amwriting and blogging about your cover reveal, write about you. Let your readers know who you are outside of writing. Write about the most interesting parts of yourself. Are you a pilot? Do you love deep sea diving? Have you traveled all over Asia on foot? Whatever it is that you\u2019ve done or that you\u2019re interested in or an expert in, write about that. And if you don\u2019t have something that makes you interesting? LEARN something interesting and bring other people along for the ride. 25. Practice. I started with telling you to write everyday. I\u2019m going to end in the same place. None of the rest of the suggestions here can replace a daily writing habit. Write everyday and finish your manuscripts. All the rest is gravy.
