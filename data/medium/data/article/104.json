Over the past few years, advertising-based social networks have continued to grow in influence, several well-known companies have pivoted or shifted into zombie mode, and an unending stream of startups continue to build unsustainable businesses. In response to the lack of timely market research for our partners at 100 Resilient Cities, we wrote an analysis of public engagement software, and published it openly for the public good. Additionally, our co-founder and CEO, Dan Parham, is supporting 100 Resilient Cities as a Subject Matter Expert on public engagement technology, and we do offer strategic consulting to many of our partners. We believe civic engagement at the local level is more important than ever. We look forward to empowering residents to create the places that reflect what matters most to them\u200a\u2014\u200aboth as individuals, and as communities.
