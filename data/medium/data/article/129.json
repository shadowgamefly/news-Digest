{"name": "129", "parent": "", "content": "Welcome to The\u00a0Cocoon This is (not really) the future\u200a\u2014\u200awhere NBA players can rest, relax, and recreate, without ever leaving the watchful eye of their team. Step inside this brave new world and learn how the Warriors are changing the way players work\u00a0\u2026 and\u00a0play. The idea that would become The Cocoon began, like most things with the Warriors, with one of Jerry West\u2019s stories. \u201cWe had just come off a two-week stretch playing seven of eight games on the road, and the players were exhausted,\u201d team owner and CEO Joe Lacob tells me while squeezing peanut-butter-and-jelly mix out of an IV bag directly into his mouth. The sweet aroma of an elementary school cafeteria filled the office behind the loading dock at Oracle Arena. \u201cOne of the games was in New York City on Sunday afternoon, and to us it\u2019s like nine in the morning. We got into the city on Friday night from Toronto, and of course our guys went out on the town.\u201d The Warriors beat the Knicks by seven points that afternoon, but the game was more difficult than it should have been. \u201cThat\u2019s what got us thinking about rest and travel and a better way to do both,\u201d Lacob says. In his view, a basketball team exists on three discrete levels of reality. A team is a collection of players, in the same way that a machine is an assemblage of parts. That\u2019s the structural level. A team is also the result of a plan or set of plans. This is the design level. Finally, a team is a collection of human beings with goals and desires that exist outside the stated objectives of the franchise. This is the motivational level. We often transition from one mode to another without considering the conceptual dissonance. For Lacob and the Warriors, the holy grail is anything that benefits the team from the structural, design, and motivational perspectives. \u201cOftentimes, a team and its players don\u2019t necessarily want the same thing, even if they\u2019re working toward the same goal. If Klay wants to get lit before a game, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not interested in scoring 40 and playing defense. But what if players could satisfy their biological motivations in ways that don\u2019t hamper the team or our investment in them? What if you could be at the bar all night but also play hard the next day?\u201d A few days after the road trip, Lacob and the Warriors brain trust got together at the team\u2019s practice facility. An article about the \u201cTinder-ization\u201d had recently been published and was being discussed. \u201cJerry doesn\u2019t understand apps, so my son was explaining it to him,\u201d Lacob says. \u201cHe was blown away.\u201d West proceeded to tell the story of how the Lakers once lost Wilt Chamberlain for five days in Cincinnati. \u201cApparently,\u201d Lacob says, peanut butter smeared across his chin, \u201cWilt was just short of 18,000.\u201d 18,000 what? \u201cYou know.\u201d Ah. \u201cSo he was, like, three away from 18, and I guess Wilt was very particular about stuff like this, and he never came back to the hotel. Jack Kent Cooke finally had to have the team leave without him.\u201d In fact, Wilt expended so much energy on his amorous pursuits, West told the room, that if Instagram were available in 1968, when the Lakers acquired the legendary big man, the team would have won five titles instead of only one. \u201cSex is strenuous on its own without having to look for it,\u201d Lacob says. \u201cIt took me two months to recover from having a three-way with the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy! Stilt was worn out before most games even started. And that\u2019s when the light bulb went off.\u201d Many were confused when the Warriors ownership group recently acquired VR Tango, a small Norwegian company specializing in disposable, virtual-reality-controllable sex toys for extremely tall individuals. Less publicized, but just as strange, was the team\u2019s purchase of a medical-feeding-tube company and the hiring of a Japanese architectural firm closely associated with the construction of pod hotels and office spaces. But it was all part of a plan, the next step in Lacob\u2019s stated goal to keep the Warriors light-years ahead of the competition by turning inefficiencies into strengths. \u201cI think of it as the Three R\u2019s,\u201d Lacob tells me. \u201cRest, recreation, and whatever the third one is. I forget. The Spurs pioneered rest, and proved it could lengthen careers. Dating apps and social media made recreation easier to access. And every team in the league feeds its players peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. What if you could combine all those elements?\u201d The result, after years of research, is the Hygge Tube. Or, as the players and staff call it, The Cocoon, an all-in-one rest, recreation, and sensory-deprivation shipping container that allows players, in a state of light unconsciousness, to ingest peanut-butter-and-jelly mix, simulate a night on the town, and even \u201chave sex,\u201d all while being transported to the team\u2019s next game. The process works like this: After road games, players shower as normal and are given recovery smoothies that contain a fast-acting narcotic, synthesized from a species of poisonous blowfish. The drug works by blocking muscle receptors, thus paralyzing the subject while allowing him to stay more or less conscious. Players then enter their Cocoon. Each pod contains a feeding apparatus, virtual-reality goggles, and disposable stimulation sleeve. The pods are temperature controlled and loaded with individually tailored virtual scenarios that simulate partying on the road. There are simulations of nightclubs, dinner and drinks with friends, an Atlanta strip club tour, an evening at LIV with members of the Kardashian family, and so on. \u201cWe\u2019re working on acquiring the rights to more celebrities,\u201d Lacob says. \u201cOur guys love that kind of stuff. The dead ones are easier than the living ones, so I\u2019m trying to get our players interested in classic movies.\u201d JaVale McGee\u2019s VR program includes a four-hour loop of the Charles Barkley\u2013Shaquille O\u2019Neal fight. Steph Curry\u2019s allegedly includes ordering pizza at home by himself and playing Rory McIlroy PGA Tour on PlayStation. \u201cWe invest so much in our players,\u201d Lacob tells me. \u201cMillions and millions. Dating apps are objectively better than hanging out in a club all night. But even that wasn\u2019t a perfect system.\u201d At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil, Draymond Green\u2019s gold-medal march was marred when he accidentally Snapchatted his penis. \u201cHe meant to send it by DM. So you see the problems that can occur,\u201d Lacob says. With The Cocoon, there\u2019s no danger of being outed by TMZ or getting a spot blown up on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever you want to do in there. Like Westworld, only you\u2019re getting your full eight-hour sleep!\u201d The pods are then loaded onto trucks or airplanes and shipped to wherever the Warriors play next. Each player\u2019s pod is transported individually, at differing speeds. For instance, Curry and all the starters except for Zaza Pachulia are sent next-day air, while the bench is transported via ground. This way, a weather issue or engine trouble doesn\u2019t affect the entire team. \u201cWe based that off packet-switching,\u201d Lacob tells me, which is the system that allows the internet to work even when parts of it aren\u2019t accessible. \u201cIt used to be a problem where the plane would strand the entire team. Now if the truck carrying James Michael McAdoo breaks down in Colorado\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s not ideal, but we can play the game. No problem.\u201d Has that ever happened? \u201cIan Clark got stuck in Tampa for a few days because of Hurricane Babar. By the time we got him back, his waste processors were almost full and The Cocoon\u2019s battery was on 12 percent.\u201d The Cocoons are kept at ground-level air pressure, and they monitor vital signs, which are sent via cell network to the Warriors\u2019 health, nutrition, and virtual-recreation department. \u201cThere\u2019s actually an app we made so we can track guys and everything,\u201d Lacob says. He fishes his phone out of his pocket and turns it toward me, grinning. \u201cSee? Draymond Green. Still alive! And\u00a0\u2026 out for delivery right now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing system,\u201d Jerry West tells me over the phone. \u201cI wish we had it when I was playing.\u201d West says that many former players he\u2019s spoken to, even those who have been critical of modern players who take games off for rest, feel the same way. \u201cIn my day, we flew commercial or took long bus trips. You could smoke in the main cabin then, and we drank on the flight. Charter flights were a huge step up. Teams understand not to let players drink on the plane. The Cocoon takes all the stress of travel out of the equation.\u201d Lacob balls up the empty PB&J IV bag, throws it in the trash, and starts unbuttoning his shirt. A technician runs a diagnostic on one of the pods. A fresh stimulation sleeve is placed gingerly in The Cocoon. Lacob steps out of his shoes. I try to keep my cool at the sight of Lacob\u2019s full-torso tribal tattoos. \u201cWant to give it a try?\u201d ", "title": "Welcome to The\u00a0Cocoon", "sentences": [{"0542": "Welcome to The\u00a0Cocoon"}, {"e702": "This is (not really) the future\u200a\u2014\u200awhere NBA players can rest, relax, and recreate, without ever leaving the watchful eye of their team.
