But you can\u00a0survive. Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies pay Karen Wickre for her advice\u200a\u2014\u200abut at the Help Desk, it\u2019s free to\u00a0you. There\u2019s a reason The Office was so popular on (at least) two continents: Many of us can relate to dysfunctional bosses, loopy coworkers, and political scheming that can dwarf the rhythms of business. Recently, stories about employee drama are everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the White House to Fox News to Uber. But what happens when you find yourself in a such a conundrum? Let\u2019s dig in. About six months ago I got my dream job\u200a\u2014\u200aa marketing position at a buzz-y tech company that, while still technically a \u201cstartup,\u201d is already thriving. I was excited about the creative challenges. Just one problem: I\u2019m miserable, as the culture here is really untenable. My boss routinely undermines me in public, bullies me in meetings, and acts buddy-buddy with my (mostly bro-ish) coworkers. Beyond that, this seems to be the way the company operates. I\u2019ve regularly heard other employees complain about bullying\u200a\u2014\u200aand I\u2019ve felt pressure to undermine my direct reports, just to fit in. I\u2019m wondering what I can do to help shift the culture\u200a\u2014\u200aand how will I know if I need to change, or to call it quits and move on? I once worked at a company where the air was just dead\u200a\u2014\u200athere was absolutely no interest in the collective culture, not even any lip service to it. I had one ally, but we quickly figured out no one else cared about the things we did. We held our noses to get through the days until we could find something else. Trust me, this is not the way to go. It eats at your soul. Follow Backchannel: Facebook |\u00a0Twitter A company culture can be a reflection of the company\u2019s competitive position: Is it an underdog or market leader? Is it reinventing itself or disruptive? But an even more important component of culture comes from the leaders, and the values they express and demonstrate. Beware the company that shows off its aspirational values endlessly, but rarely shows them in dealing with employees or customers. So I have to pause to ask if you studied up on any of this before you took the job (and did you meet your future boss?! Was he on mood stabilizers that day?). Your first impressions of a place and the people count for a lot, and you should trust your gut\u200a\u2014\u200aif something seems off, pay attention. A friend recently turned down a very good offer because everyone she met, all of whom gave her a good sense of the business and her role, had no emotional affect. No one had anything to say about the leadership or their coworkers. Even though the job came with a nice boost in salary and title, she said no\u200a\u2014\u200aand has no regrets.

Welcome to Diversity Debt: The Crisis That Could Sink UberIt\u2019s easy to postpone thinking about diversity while building your company\u2014until that company implodes.backchannel.com But you can\u2019t always \u201cread the room\u201d before you\u2019re hired\u200a\u2014\u200aand now you\u2019re inside. You mention that you manage people, which means you have colleagues at the same level. If any seem like kindred spirits, seek them out one by one to get acquainted. If you get a good read on their humanity, do a sotto voce check of your observations. Those with some tenure might shed light on why this behavior seems rampant, and what or who are behind it. It\u2019s possible that several of you can come up with tactics to discourage the bullying\u200a\u2014\u200aif nothing else, by encouraging and rewarding more positive behavior and recognition for genuine good work, and making sure your teams see the difference. You don\u2019t mention it, but the \u201cpressure\u201d you feel about bullying people yourself is worth studying. Where does the pressure seem to come from\u200a\u2014\u200aand are there implied (or stated) repercussions if you don\u2019t go along? As for your own boss, ultimately you\u2019re going to feel better if you can have a candid conversation broaching some of the behavior you\u2019ve seen from him\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if you don\u2019t get the outcome you want, you\u2019ll have taken the high road.

Then move on to say his approach is not the way to motivate you, implying that for him to look good, he should stop treating you like this. (I\u2019ve used this very line, and it stopped the guy from being a jerk.) Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee this head-on approach will work, however polite and well-intentioned it may be. As for any collegial coworkers, even if a number of you devote yourselves to better behavior and more positive incentives, you may simply be outnumbered, run over by the weight of \u201cwe\u2019ve always done it this way\u201d or \u201cthis is who we are.\u201d If all else fails, there\u2019s no shame in making your escape plan. You came in good faith and discovered that things were not what they seemed, and so you have to go. Ideally, you can find another job while you have this one, but not landing a new gig is not the reason to stay and suffer. Sometimes the timing just doesn\u2019t line up.
