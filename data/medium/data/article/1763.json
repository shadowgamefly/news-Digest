{"name": "1763", "parent": "", "content": "On Medium Writers Who Abuse the \u201cBlocking\u201d Function to Insulate Themselves from Criticism\u2026 by Alexander Zubatov Recently, I wrote a response to a Medium story by the writer Anthony J. Williams, @anthoknees, who tweets under the moniker \u201cThe Real Racist\u201d and has 1.5 thousand followers on Medium. The story\u00a0of\u00a0his\u00a0I\u2019d\u00a0commented\u00a0on, entitled \u201clet\u2019s stop coddling white feelings,\u201d suggests that the best way to advance the cause of racial justice is to stop caring whether or not blacks alienate whites. I wrote a response to this story in which I took issue with Mr. Williams\u2019 point, linked to another recent story of mine that had discussed this very issue, and outlined the general idea that you can\u2019t fight racism by directing anger and hatred at the racist. My response was completely polite, did not contain any insults, epithets, profanities or anything of that sort, and tried to be constructive in suggesting another way forward. A bunch of people clearly agreed with me, and I quickly got a bunch of recommends over the course of two days (34 as of this writing). This would have resulted in elevating my response to the top or near the top of the responses to Mr. Williams\u2019 article. Sometime today, however, Mr. Williams used Medium\u2019s blocking function to block me, and my response promptly stopped getting \u201cviews\u201d and \u201clikes.\u201d This is because of the way Medium and Medium Staff have designed the \u201cblocking\u201d function, which results in making a blocked response to an article no longer visible to anyone looking for responses beneath that article: https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214994577-Blocking-other-users To say this another way, not only has Medium armed thin-skinned writers with a tool to insulate themselves from criticism, but it has also deprived every other Medium reader of the opportunity to view that criticism. This is not the first time I have seen the blocking function used in this manner, and I\u2019m sure it will not be the last. The way Medium has set it up, the \u201cblock user\u201d function might as well say \u201csilence criticism from writer with whom you disagree.\u201d If @MediumStaff wants this to be a vibrant community where a variety of viewpoints and voices gets heard, it needs to prevent the blocking function from being abused in this manner. If you want to block someone to prevent yourself from seeing anything they write\u00a0because\u00a0you\u00a0just\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0deal\u00a0with\u00a0it, that\u2019s fine, but you shouldn\u2019t be permitted to block them from seeing what you write or to block them from commenting on it. This is especially the case when someone like Mr. Williams is using the blocking function to eviscerate an already-posted comment that has gotten lots of positive reactions. If someone is truly spewing hatred, profanity or other abuse, that\u2019s different, of course, but blocking someone who\u2019s merely writing a measured response to your writing should not be allowed. Medium can\u2019t, or, at least, shouldn\u2019t, turn a user-blocker into a user-silencer.
