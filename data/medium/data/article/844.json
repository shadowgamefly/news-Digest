So, as you all know, I lost my job. I was called out of a staff meeting, taken to my classroom and told to go to the district office, tomorrow. Do not come to school before or after the meeting. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200. As I sat there staring, my grade level team came in to see what was up. I had left all of my belongings in the library and they were bringing them to me. When I saw them, I instantly burst into tears. I didn\u2019t know what was up, but I knew that it could not be good. My fear is that I was being fired immediately. They were all very supportive. They promised to be there for me and help me in any way that they could. In fact, one even prayed over me. After I found out that I had not been picked to continue at the school district, I asked two of them to write me letters of recommendation. \u201cOf course,\u201d I was told. Four weeks after officially asking them, I got a text from the one that prayed over me. \u201cI can\u2019t write your letter, I\u2019ve overextended myself. Hope you asked other people.\u201d I don\u2019t think you can even come close to naming all of the snarky God comments that I wanted to text back. I even typed out a couple. But I deleted. I mean, how do I know that she didn\u2019t pray about it and God told her not to help me? I can\u2019t be that great. I\u2019ve asked Santa for a snowboard for six years now and I am still waiting. I never make the nice list\u00a0:( As I was up on my high horse thinking about how I was a person of my word and how much I value integrity, I remembered something. I have written about someone in my articles that asked me in January to not ever write about him again. In the heat of the moment, like a child being caught doing something bad, I said, \u201cI promise!!!\u201d And I\u2019m sure at the time, that I meant it. But after he said, \u201cThese are the last words that you will ever hear me say,\u201d I kind of decided that it didn\u2019t matter. He was gone, so I could write about anything I wanted. Besides, I only said it to get me out of trouble. Yeah\u2026.and then he popped up again in February. And I had that drunken night when I wrote a story that was not technically about him, but it was like one side of a conversation, me talking to him. When you are really drunk, everything seems like a good idea. Including sending articles to people that you promised never to write about. It took about three days until he lowered the boom. The timing was perfect on his part. I had texted him that I had some questions. He texted back, \u201cI have one for you. Why did you write about me when you promised me that you wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Then everything went dark and the spotlight of truth was upon me and I was sweating, people! I tried to get off on a technicality. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really about you, it was about me talking to you. \u201cSorry if you misunderstood my intent.\u201d His response, \u201cSorry you misunderstood my intent for you not to write about me.\u201d Then he called my stories, creepy and said, \u201cDo what you want.\u201d He\u2019s gone for good this time. And who can blame him? So, what did I learn? You can\u2019t break a promise and then get mad when someone breaks a promise to you. Karma. We always want it to work when it is against someone else. I don\u2019t think anyone ever says, \u201cKarma, bring it on!\u201d when talking about themselves. Unless you happen to be on Santa\u2019s nice list. And if you are, can you PLEASE ask for a snowboard for me? I mean well.
