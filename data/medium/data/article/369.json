{"name": "369", "parent": "", "content": "The Waterwheel Water trickling water gurgling surging splashing sploshy burbling Wooden wheel tirelessly turning spun by cascading torrents churning O I\u2019m such a naughty girl! On sunny days I love to take A whippy whacking rod One to make my bottom ache Naughty me, I\u2019m quite undressed Soft lush grass, bare feet caressed A sunlit stroll, by gleaming brook Down to my secret spanking nook Passers-by would not believe What devious imagination first conceived Of harnessing pure water\u2019s flow To whack naughty bottoms so I bend across the wooden bench And slot the cane into the post I feel it press upon my cheeks Then the bit I love the most On the wheel there is a peg It lifts the cane and makes it creak Up and up it bends until it slips Whacking back to make me squeak A short pause to catch my breath Cane upon my stinging cheeks The peg will soon be round again Do any ever hear my shrieks? My merciless water-powered imagination machine Whisks my mind away to waking dreams I imagine wrist and ankle stocks They place a rod across my bum Leaving me struggling against my locks My shouts receding as they walk away Leaving me at the mercy of the wheel Perhaps they\u2019ll not return today Or I\u2019m a naughty miller\u2019s daughter Sent to the wheel, discovered wanking I\u2019m disciplined by gushing water Returning home to show my spanking Afterwards I love to lie On the dewy riverbank under sky Damp grass soothing poor pink bum Slow filthy rubbing \u2019til I come Mesmerised by the turning wheel I rub to the rhythm of the lifting cane Massaging deep within my crack Pleasure overwhelming pain O how it bends, and then whips back Where my bottom used to be My ears fill with an imagined thwack Until I\u2019m swept away excitedly At night I listen to the rain A trillion raindrops fill my dreams Uniting\u2026 merging\u2026 surging\u2026 Into torrential bottom smacking streams . . .
