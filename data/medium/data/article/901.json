Let me tell you about a colleague I used to have; let\u2019s call them \u201cHistory\u2019s Greatest Monster.\u201d Now, History\u2019s Greatest Monster and I worked in different departments, but occasionally I would get a request from HGM to do something\u200a\u2014\u200ausually with no notice, usually something that had to be completed very quickly. When I pushed back, that\u2019s when they began: the short, snarky emails that always ended with an ellipsis\u200a\u2014\u200athree little dots, goading me, daring me. It was HGM\u2019s power move, and reader, it worked. As an act of digital passive aggression, the ellipsis is far greater than the sum of its parts. The ellipsis used to be coy and playful, imbued with a touch of mystery and intrigue. A cliffhanger to be used after a crucial clue has been uncovered in a detective show, or the final word in a flirtatious conversation\u200a\u2014\u200alike a winky-face emoji, but less creepy. In his book Making a Point: The Pernickety Story of English Punctuation, British linguist David Crystal describes one context of the ellipsis as \u201cexpressing continuation when we wish to convey the notion of \u2018something that is unnecessary to specify further.\u2019 \u201d Like the way you trail off when you\u2019re expecting the person you\u2019re talking to will absolutely already know that the best version of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah is\u2026 any version except the Leonard Cohen version. The ellipsis used to be a communion between speaker and listener, a small but important cue that said: \u201cHey, I\u2019m on your side, buddy.\u201d Now, it\u2019s the opposite. Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker once described Twitter as the world\u2019s greatest video game, where the goal is to amass likes, followers, retweets\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially, to get a high score. To do that, you perform\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re funny, or you\u2019re smart, or maybe you work out a cheat whereby you can rise up the rankings faster than average because you post a lot of good pictures of dogs. You also fight, like any video game: You figure out who the enemy is, and you try to beat them, for points. This is where the ellipsis comes in. It has become a finishing move, a power play; the communion it represents is no longer between speaker and listener, but rather between the speaker and those already on their side. Patrick D. Elliott, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at University College London and visiting scholar at Berlin\u2019s Center for General Linguistics, sees it as deliberately performative: \u201c[The ellipsis] used to convey something like the following: \u2018I could go on to explain why this is weird, but it\u2019s so obvious to the rest of my audience that I don\u2019t need to bother. Rather, I\u2019m using ellipsis to demonstrate my awareness of this.\u2019 \u201d In a public forum like Twitter, you\u2019re not only demonstrating your awareness; you\u2019re demonstrating the awareness of the other people invested in the argument you\u2019re having\u200a\u2014\u200aa surefire way to get gratification in the form of likes and retweets. Because everyone loves a Twitter beef. But this doesn\u2019t explain my inter-office e-mail beef with HGM. Rules that apply on social media can\u2019t be applied to all digital communications, particular those that predate the platform by a good couple of decades. I\u2019m willing to admit there might be a generational divide here, and indeed it\u2019s interesting to see in this Reddit thread how older people are passing off their use of the ellipsis as a sign-off as an attempt at digital etiquette, a carry-over from the habit of ending any written correspondence with a salutation or signature. I, being a freelancer and procrastinator, live my life on Twitter, so I carry over my negative, hostile associations with the ellipsis to another form. Alternatively HGM knew exactly what they were doing, and their use of the ellipsis was even more pointed than I assumed at the time. One thing that does unite email, Twitter, and all digital communications is the durability of the conversations we have there\u2014the idea that anything we say online is committed to canon, and the nuance that we can give to a sentence face-to-face is lost in the fuzz. Spencer Hazel, senior lecturer in applied linguistics and communications at the University of Newcastle in England, suggests that the ellipsis is being used as a means of self-preservation, a way to wriggle out of an argument of opinion you may not want to commit yourself to 100 percent: \u201cIt may well be that we develop new strategies for dealing with the durability of what we \u2018say\u2019 in the conversations that we have on social media to protect ourselves from online retaliation.\u201d Because the ellipsis is by nature ambiguous, using it can make it easier to say things like \u201cyou\u2019ve taken that out of context\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant at all\u201d when you know you\u2019ve said something abominable. One consequence of the rise of digital communications has been the recalibration of certain aspects of grammar and syntax that previously were gathering dust at the back of the lexical cupboard. The ellipsis, like its more ubiquitous cousins, the @ and the #, has become newly present in the digital space. Think of how an ellipsis precedes a command\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, clicking \u201cFile\u201d on this document (as I write it in Google Docs) brings me 10 options that end with an ellipsis. In many messaging apps, an animated ellipsis appears when you\u2019re waiting for someone to type out a reply. As we become more familiar communicating online, particular where limits are put on the amount we can say, we begin to imbue smaller words or gestures with new characteristics, so that we can convey more. @ is now a word in and of itself, immortalized in this JME track from 2015; hashtags aren\u2019t necessarily used to make something searchable; and the eggplant emoji was, I\u2019m fairly certain, initially intended to mean \u201ceggplant.\u201d None of us could have predicted that the ellipsis would have its good name sullied, but here we are. However, don\u2019t get complacent. We cannot begin to normalize the use of the ellipsis in this hostile way. We must call out every use of the passive-aggressive ellipsis we see. We need to be able to enjoy ribald whodunnits, casual sexting and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s autobiography (there really are a lot of ellipses in this book, Bruce) without being reminded of its negative connotations.
