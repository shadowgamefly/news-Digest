OptionB.Org is her training program for the rest of\u00a0us. Shortly after Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband suddenly to a heart condition, she was talking to a friend about an upcoming father-child activity. Together, they came up with a plan to fill in for her child\u2019s dad, Dave Goldberg. Thinking about it felt awful, and she wept. \u201cI want Dave,\u201d she told her friend. \u201cI want option A.\u201d The friend, as she later wrote on Facebook, put his arms around her and said, \u201cOption A is not available. So let\u2019s just kick the shit out of option B.\u201d Follow Backchannel: Facebook |\u00a0Twitter On April 24, just before the second anniversary of Goldberg\u2019s untimely death, Sandberg will publish a book by that name. Cowritten with Wharton professor and Sandberg\u2019s good friend Adam Grant, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy isn\u2019t simply a memoir of her specific loss. It\u2019s a guide to a more resilient future for anyone who has dealt with any form of adversity. And, just as Sandberg started a foundation to help people come together around the themes of her first book, she plans to introduce a nonprofit initiative around this one: OptionB.Org launches today. Sandberg believes resilience\u200a\u2014\u200athe capacity to recover quickly from difficulty\u200a\u2014\u200ais a muscle that can be strengthened over time. And certainly, if there were a weight-lifting competition for resilience, she\u2019d likely place near the top, because she\u2019s spent the past two years building that muscle. Consider OptionB.Org her guide for everyone else\u200a\u2014\u200amethods for lessening the isolation, silence, and despair that accompany everything from death and loss to sexual assault. The website will be a media hub and connection point for people to access resources and community support. Which people, exactly? Well, anyone who is struggling with hard things. To start, the group will focus on seven topics, which will include grief and loss, hate and violence, and raising resilient kids. \u201cThe topic areas are based on input from our advisory board,\u201d explains Rachel Thomas, president of the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation, which will run OptionB.org along with Lean In. Thomas ticks off a list of more than a dozen individuals, including the Equal Justice Initiative\u2019s Bryan Stevenson and the Global Fund for Women\u2019s Musimbi Kanyoro. \u201cWe will learn a lot and grow and evolve,\u201d says Thomas. The site features stories of survivors, including people like NFL star Vernon Turner, who overcame drug abuse and trauma, and Kathy Andersen, a sexual abuse survivor who now helps other young women who\u2019ve survived abuse and exploitation. And you\u2019ll be encouraged to add your own story: Readers can choose\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook-style\u200a\u2014\u200afrom an array of reactions such as \u201cStay strong\u201d and \u201cI feel the same way\u201d to react to the posts, videos, and images. Option B will also run Facebook groups around shared challenges. And, it will connect visitors to other (non-Facebook) groups run over email, or in online forums. The group has partnered with several organizations such as Meetup and The Dinner Party, an organization that runs peer-hosted dinners for those coping with loss, to help folks meet up in person as well. And it will offer material from a broad range of experts. The organization, like the book, is a fitting tribute to a man who was beloved by his family, friends, and the many people whose lives he impacted in Silicon Valley and beyond. Like many tech writers, I have my own Dave Goldberg story. I interacted with him often in the last few years of his life, but it was a small favor on a Friday afternoon that stays with me. It was the spring of 2014 when I still wrote for Fortune, and I had been tasked with writing a cover story about Yahoo\u2019s prospects under Marissa Mayer on a very tight turnaround. I didn\u2019t understand how to evaluate the aging brand, so I called Goldberg for help. He invited me to come by SurveyMonkey, where he was then CEO. A six-year Yahoo veteran with strong financial chops, Goldberg possessed two critical characteristics: He could (A) explain financial concepts I didn\u2019t understand while (B) not making me feel stupid for my questions. He sat with me for over an hour, patiently drawing out concepts in my notebook for me when I was slow to grasp them. There was nothing directly in it for him; I just needed help. This desire to help people, even if there wasn\u2019t a lot in it for him, was central to Goldberg\u2019s legacy. So it\u2019s fitting that Sandberg would honor him by attempting to help others\u200a\u2014\u200ato share what she has so far learned about how to not only choose but also kick the shit out of Option B.
