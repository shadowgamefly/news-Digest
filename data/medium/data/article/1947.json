Got\u00a0it. I\u2019m leaning once and done. This book writing thing is way overrated. I am having trouble sleeping and having trouble staying awake. My family has had enough and I don\u2019t blame them. I identify myself as a writer and a book felt like the next logical progression. That progression isn\u2019t progressing as planned. Beyond that, this has been a blast. The easy part was crafting the first draft of the book. Ideas coalesced with ease, words flowed and my concentration level was on point. I must be one of the gifted few who can write without the requisite suffering. Once the first draft was done, I cockily started sharing my \u201csuccess\u201d on social media. There were a lot of \u201ccoming soon\u201d purposely vague messages to generate interest. \u201cThis book should be out any day now fans, brace yourself for the fireworks that will be the release\u201d. I\u2019m now on version 1.29 and my confidence level is at 23% and trending down. I\u2019ve gone dark on social media and the marketing department has been informed that they need to shut down their operations for the foreseeable future. The editing process has been eye opening. I am self publishing this book and doing all that I can to keep the spending to a bare minimum. My editor is my wife and she has been honest with me in all the best ways. I trust her implicitly and while I\u2019ve put up a fight on some of her suggested changes, deep down I know that she is right 99.8% of the time. As I approach, fingers crossed, the final edit, here is what I\u2019ve learned over the past few weeks, post first-draft completion: My insecurity level (as writer) is at an all time\u00a0high. The first sentence my wife (editor) read back to me, as she attempted to understand its purpose, was a true eye opener. The sentence managed to be embarrassingly pretentious. Not to mention horrifically constructed and factually inaccurate all at the same time. Is it possible I didn\u2019t actually write it? Shit, I\u2019m not very good at this. I\u2019ve found the more I attempt to write in a specific style, the more cringe-worthy it becomes. My book is about gardening and plants and I like to think I bring a great combo of high brow and low brow writing to the table. When it occurs naturally, it can be magical. When I force it, it feels well, forced and inauthentic. That first sentence we reviewed was a wake-up call. As I have edited sentences and swapped out words along the way, I\u2019ve made the mistake of not reading the entire passage in order to evaluate the flow. That leads to some choppy story. I\u2019ve been way too over anxious to get the book done and that has ended up slowing things down even more. Lesson learned: that first edit needs to be done slowly and methodically or subsequent edits become more and more difficult. My insecurity level (book idea) is at an all time\u00a0high. I loved the premise of this book. I\u2019ve lived it for almost two decades. That was the constant from the beginning. The difficult part was how to construct a book around that central idea. Now that the construct of the book is done, I\u2019m doubting the original premise. Have I supported the premise properly? Has the story turned in a way that has now forced me into a different premise? What I battle now is believing that my central idea has to be the greatest idea of all time and one that no one has ever dared to tackle before. I\u2019m worried that if this concept isn\u2019t 100% flawless, I shouldn\u2019t attempt it at all. Mess this up and a 2nd book isn\u2019t an option. Never mind the fact that I\u2019m publishing it myself and only have to answer to me. I so have to lighten up. I find myself enjoying reading more than\u00a0ever. I\u2019m appreciating a beautifully put together sentence more than ever before. I am so tired of my own writing style that everyone else\u2019s seems to be the best I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019m jealous of the flawlessly flowing passage. I\u2019m jealous of the simple heartfelt sentence. I\u2019m jealous of any writing that evokes strong emotion. I\u2019m so close to my own word style and have poured over the same sentences for week\u2019s now that I honestly have no idea if they are great or awful. I assume every writer goes through this and can only hope I come out better for it on the other side. Eliminating chapters has been difficult. When my first draft was complete, it was 188 pages. This is on 8.5 x 11 paper and in color because there are over 300 photographs included in the book. I have no choice, it is about plants and the photos are what ultimately tell the story. Add it all up and the minimum I could charge for the book was $32.00 and that included $0 royalty through Amazon. How funny is that? Back to the drawing board. After some number crunching and market evaluation, I determined that I had to get the page total down to 90 or so pages. That meant eliminating half of the f\u2019n book. All that work, time and effort would be gone in a flash. Everything I write is brilliant, the world needs to see it all. After a good cry, I got the latest version of the book down to 94 pages. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, it is much tighter, much more supportive of the central thesis and manageable financially. And if I achieve any level of success with this one, Volume 2 is right around the corner and I\u2019m already off to a great head start. Book writing is very different from blog\u00a0writing. My blog is 7+ years old. I\u2019ve written over 1,100 posts. They\u2019ve all centered around what this book is ultimately about: the beauty of our gardens beyond flowers. The posts are all very of the moment. I like to include what is going on in my life and relating that to my garden. Looking back on old posts can be difficult, they do not always stand the test of time. A book is another animal all together. It needs to stand on its own. It needs to be evergreen. While I am including a lot of personal anecdotes, I have to be very careful to not allow it to become too \u201cof the day\u201d or too inside or even too me.
