Three years after his marriage, he and his wife started to question their relationship, and Pennebaker, confused and unsettled, sank into a depression. He ate less, drank more, and started smoking.

His depression lifted and he felt liberated. He began to reconnect with his deep love for his wife. But the writing had an even farther-reaching impact.

Over and over again Pennebaker did studies in which he divided people into two groups and asked some to write about emotionally significant experiences, and the others to write about common things: their shoes, or maybe the cars passing on the street. Both groups wrote for the same span\u200a\u2014\u200aabout 20- minutes a day, three days in a row."}, {"d039": "In Pennebaker\u2019s experiments, some participants wrote about sexual abuse by once-trusted family members; some about catastrophic failures; others about the devastating losses of their deepest relationships through breakups, illness, and death. One woman described unfathomable guilt stemming from an incident that had happened when she was 10. She\u2019d left a toy on the floor on which her grandmother had slipped and fallen, ultimately leading to the grandmother\u2019s death. Another man wrote about a warm summery night when he was nine years old. His father had taken him outside and calmly announced that having children had been the biggest mistake of his life, and that he was leaving."}, {"4105": "In each study, Pennebaker found that the people who wrote about emotionally charged episodes experienced marked improvement in their physical and mental well-being. They were happier, less depressed and less anxious. In the months after the writing sessions, they had lower blood pressure, improved immune function, and fewer visits to the doctor. They also reported better relationships, improved memory, and more success at work."}, {"bb53": "When I first discovered Pennebaker\u2019s research, I was struck by the way it echoed my own teenage experience journaling about my father\u2019s cancer. While my father was dying, and then when he was gone, my life was painfully different, and the writing helped me voice my regret about all the time I hadn\u2019t spent with him and the all the things I hadn\u2019t said. I also wrote about the moments I didn\u2019t regret, and how I\u2019d given what I could. Through that writing, I learned to sit with all of my emotions, both the pleasant and unpleasant ones.
