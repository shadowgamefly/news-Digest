Using Emeril\u2019s recipe (a thing I thought I\u2019d never say), the process seems familiar and comforting. Just five loaves in, I realize this bread-making business could become an easy habit. Do most of the work in the morning, with my coffee\u200a\u2014\u200ano more than a half hour of focus\u200a\u2014\u200aand let the beasties do the rest throughout the day. It\u2019s become a thing I do now, or a thing I can do, instead of a distant aspirational thing. I make bread. The process is almost ritual\u200a\u2014\u200ameasure, mix, knead, rise, punch, rise again, bake. The dough feels vaguely warm and alive in my hands and the rising is reliable. The result is, likewise, reliable\u200a\u2014\u200alike a memory. Substantial, satisfying, a comfort. It\u2019s, surprisingly, not that hard. It requires attention. It is rewarding. You will fail. You will thrill. The burr will not be eradicated. It can, however, be placated. Distraction is good. I realize that my bread project neglected the thornier corners of baking\u2014the sourdoughs and the whole grains, the boules and the batards. I\u2019m not ready for a \u2018starter\u2019, though that sort of sounds like where you begin. I am aware that I skew sweet, but it is February. These were my starter breads and, though I still want to own a brioche, I\u2019m pretty proud of myself. That, combined with all the warm bread in my belly, has lightened the darkest month and calmed the crisis in the chest. I recommend it. Go make some bread. I\u2019m going to paint the kitchen.
