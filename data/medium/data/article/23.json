Now, thanks to Amazon and Netflix, the disruption is coming for the indies. Filmmakers talk about the shift, and what it means for the future of\u00a0movies. Macon Blair was terrified. The year was 2013 and he was the unknown star of a movie no one had heard of, made on the cheap, and directed by a guy who hadn\u2019t made anything in six years. Blair was sitting in a vast auditorium in France with hundreds of strangers, seated beside his friend and collaborator, the writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who had risked everything to get their grisly drama, Blue Ruin, into the world. Finally, people were about to see what Saulnier and Blair had accomplished together. They had reason to be scared. Several months prior, Saulnier stood in front of a camera and made a pitch. He needed to raise $35,000 via Kickstarter to finance his movie independently. Saulnier described the movie as \u201ca revenge film equally suited for art house cinephiles and die-hard genre fans.\u201d Somehow, he compelled 438 donors to kick in $37,828. But even that wasn\u2019t enough\u200a\u2014\u200aafter reaching the Kickstarter goal, Saulnier dumped thousands of his own savings, mortgaged his house, liquidated his wife\u2019s retirement fund, and dove headlong into credit card debt before Blue Ruin was funded and ultimately completed. Eight months after the Kickstarter campaign, the movie made its premiere at the jeer-happy Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors\u2019 Fortnight, and that\u2019s where Blair became really nervous. With no distribution, debt looming, and anonymity haunting them, the fate of the movie\u200a\u2014\u200aand something resembling the future\u200a\u2014\u200ahung in the balance. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it must have felt like for Jeremy,\u201d Blair says. \u201cEven for me, just being secondarily involved, there\u2019s this huge pressure.\u201d Blair knew that it wasn\u2019t just that audiences needed to like Blue Ruin. Someone needed to pay for it. \u201cYou gotta sell the thing, and if it doesn\u2019t sell,\u201d Blair says, \u201cthey might have to move or they\u2019re gonna be broke. Everything was on the line.\u201d Later that day, the movie sold to the Weinstein Company\u2019s boutique outfit, Radius, for a reported $500,000\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to recoup the Saulniers and provide a budget to distribute the movie. The world would see Blue Ruin, and Jeremy Saulnier would not be homeless. In a statement issued shortly after the deal was made, Radius copresidents Tom Quinn and Jason Janego said: \u201cBlue Ruin is a masterpiece and a future cult classic. It is one of the most exceptional discoveries of the last few years thanks to Jeremy\u2019s deft hand.\u201d Less than one year later, the movie premiered in America. And while it earned less than $1 million during a brief theatrical run, Quinn and Janego were right: Blue Ruin has become a kind of cult classic, a vicious and precise thriller that singes the eyebrows. It lives on, but not through midnight screenings or hipster video store clerks. Blue Ruin entered the wider consciousness when the movie was made available to stream on Netflix\u200a\u2014\u200athen quaintly known as Netflix Instant\u200a\u2014\u200ain August 2014. Netflix famously does not reveal streaming viewership data, but the mostly anonymous Saulnier\u2019s little-seen little movie predicted a vast wave of possibility, foretelling a major shift in the industry. Blue Ruin is a modern indie movie success story; its arc recalls the \u201990s heyday of the Weinsteins, Quentin Tarantino, and the acquisition hype cycle. But it leveraged the new vagaries of movie production, including an evolving festival culture, streaming platforms, and crowdfunding. In many ways, Blue Ruin is much like Reservoir Dogs, a movie that arrived like a comet 25 years ago at the Sundance Film Festival. But it\u2019s different, too\u200a\u2014\u200aReservoir Dogs was a video store phenomenon made by a director whose cinephilia was forged in a video store. Blue Ruin is a streaming baby, christened by Netflix. \u201cWhen I was working on Blue Ruin, that was the first time we were exposed to this whole world of streaming,\u201d Blair says. \u201cAnd at first, it\u2019s not that we were suspicious; we were just like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how this works. Are people even gonna see it if it\u2019s just on demand?\u2019 And as it turned out, it seems as though people saw that movie much, much more on streaming platforms than they did in the theater. It makes a lot of sense, especially for smaller movies that maybe don\u2019t have a big star in them or maybe they don\u2019t have a ton of money for promotion and they can be discovered by word of mouth.\u201d With its success has come the spoils of a bona fide indie movie hit: Saulnier has become a name-brand filmmaker after last year\u2019s (even grislier) Green Room, and the sad-eyed Blair has become a working actor in Hollywood\u200a\u2014\u200ahe appeared in the Matthew McConaughey drama Gold earlier this year and will be in the forthcoming Steven Soderbergh comedy Logan Lucky. Blair\u2019s a filmmaker in his own right now, too. His directorial debut, the similarly violent crime drama I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, premiered at Sundance in January, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. But Blair wasn\u2019t much scared at the premiere of this movie. Its future was clear. \u201cWhen we took this one to Sundance this year, its distribution was already all stitched up. It had been from the beginning,\u201d Blair says. \u201cIt was kind of relaxing because there was nothing to worry about. Obviously you hope people are going to enjoy it and the audience is going to like it and it\u2019s gonna get reviewed nicely, but at the very least, we didn\u2019t have to worry about who was gonna buy it, because it was already a done deal.\u201d Blair didn\u2019t have to contend with the typical festival experience: He didn\u2019t have to idly wait to hear about bids on his movie. He didn\u2019t have to field calls from his agent or pitch the marketing vision to executives. He didn\u2019t have to haggle over recutting or reshooting the movie\u2019s violent conclusion. And he didn\u2019t have to wait very long for the rest of the world to discover his movie, and that\u2019s because I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore was paid for and is distributed exclusively by Netflix. In a highly unusual strategy, four weeks after he took home the Grand Jury Prize in Park City, his movie was made available to the streaming service\u2019s approximately 94 million subscribers worldwide. \u201cWith Blue Ruin\u00a0\u2026 we took pretty much a full year of traveling to different festivals to promote it before it came out,\u201d Blair says of the movie, which appeared in theaters more than 11 months after that fateful night at Cannes. \u201cAnd in this case, it was like almost less than a month. A much faster turnaround.\u201d Quentin Tarantino and John Cooper at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival (Getty\u00a0Images) Independent cinema is moving out of the art house and into every house. The collapse of this viewing window and the bidding-war armistice has been mitigated by prefab dealmaking. Technocratic distribution companies like Netflix and Amazon have upended the state of independently produced movies. Film festivals that screen these movies were once the bastion for work created beyond the perception of Hollywood\u2019s studio structures\u200a\u2014\u200afilms that were either unable or unwilling to penetrate the cast iron gates that lead to the moviemaking seats of power. The festivals were a home for insurgents, temples that hoisted Tarantino, Michael Moore, Sofia Coppola, Kevin Smith, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, Todd Solondz, Todd Haynes, Ava DuVernay, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, and dozens more into the frame. Today, a movie that has been bought, paid for, and strategized against a global calendar by a massive public company is dissonant with the spirit of independent movies. What is happening is not an erosion of indie cinema, per se, nor a dissolution of risk-taking work\u200a\u2014\u200aSaulnier\u2019s and Blair\u2019s films are unforgiving and uncompromising genre movies, as likely to bleed and wail as anything from 1992. But their parentage raises some fascinating questions about origins, funding, and accessibility in an evolving movie culture. Netflix and Amazon are eating yet another part of the entertainment community. But what happens when everything has been swallowed up? \u201cWe\u2019re not the same,\u201d Ted Sarandos told Deadline last year. \u201c[Amazon] put themselves in the place of Sony Pictures Classics. That\u2019s not really a disruption as much as it is a replacement. What I\u2019m trying to do is take the benefits and the beautiful byproduct of the internet, which is all about consumer choice, and apply it to movies where no one else has. The theatrical movie window is the only window that really still exists. Every other form of entertainment is pretty much available to consumers where and when they want it. Perpetuating the movie window\u200a\u2014\u200aadding new money to perpetuate the old system\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t think is really that interesting.\u201d Sarandos is the chief content officer at Netflix, and his gentle trolling of Amazon is notable. (Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on the record for this story.) Both companies have grand ambitions in the movie business, which consumers will see in releases in coming months. But before that, we can see how they plan to overwhelm the industry in the same way that they have in TV. Netflix goes direct to its service, with virtually no theatrical window. Amazon operates in a more traditional fashion, holding the window open before sending its original films to its streaming platform offered via Amazon Prime. Amazon applies lessons learned from working within the Hollywood studio experience; Netflix defies them at will. Their strategies are different, but the endgame feels largely the same\u200a\u2014\u200aattack the most vulnerable market in movies: the little guys. In recent years, many of the indie-boutique shingles that the major studios once supported\u200a\u2014\u200aParamount Vantage, Warner Independent Pictures\u200a\u2014\u200ahave closed up shop. They\u2019ve become victims of an increasingly corporatized, IP-centric major studio strategy. Those that remain, including Fox Searchlight, Miramax, and Focus Features, have been weakened. These satellite operations working inside corporations supported independent filmmakers and smaller projects, in an effort to serve arthouse audiences, court award season prestige, and provide the corporations a bit of soul. The continued dissolution of these outlets has created an open lane. In their place, a new breed of independent-minded curators\u200a\u2014\u200abased largely in Silicon Valley and Seattle\u200a\u2014\u200ahas risen. The tension between them starts in theaters and ends at home. \u201cIf Screening Room happened,\u201d Sarandos said last year, \u201cthat would be real disruption.\u201d The Screening Room is the much-ballyhooed initiative by Sean Parker, onetime Facebook president and entrepreneur. It is meant to redefine the moviegoing experience by changing how consumers see first-run movies: for the price of a $150 set-top box and a $50 screening fee per 48-hour window, new movies would appear in your home on opening day. Want to see Kong: Skull Island from the comfort of your futon? Parker wants you to as well. But most studios have been slow to accept the notion. Ever since news of the potential service\u200a\u2014\u200aand its fraught negotiations with the major studios\u200a\u2014\u200abroke last year, Hollywood has whinged and fretted about the future of its business. I wrote about this panic last year. At last month\u2019s CinemaCon, an annual convention of theater owners and major studios, it appeared that the chilliness around the Screening Room has finally begun to thaw. (All this amid a boom in arthouse love in New York.) But in the year since it was announced, and right underneath its nose, Sarandos and his friendly competitors at Amazon have been subverting the very process by which movies are seen, giving people who are uninterested in the theatergoing experience a way to get their content quickly and easily. They have built a Screening Room experience inside their own business model. \u201cThere\u2019s no physical supply chain,\u201d Sarandos told Deadline. \u201cSo the idea that you could do something on a global platform was impossible then and more than possible right now\u200a\u2014\u200aand the norm. Netflix now, we\u2019re in every country in the world except for Syria, North Korea and China. When we launch our movies and TV shows, we launch them everywhere at the same second. When we buy a movie at Sundance, it\u2019s available to the whole world.\u201d The whole world. Sarandos fashions himself as an old-school Hollywood Showman\u2013meets\u2013Silicon Valley Great Man\u200a\u2014\u200aSteve Jobs with a creased copy of The Kid Stays in the Picture. These are incisive and persuasive words from someone who has spent a lot of time imagining how best to completely upend a system he perceives as broken. Or, at least, ready for the taking. It\u2019s Ayn Randian thinking, and perhaps justified. Netflix grew by more than 5 million subscribers last quarter, and its stock price is up 44 percent in the past year, according to The Wall Street Journal. It\u2019s done so by adding more than $5 billion worth of original content, from children\u2019s programming to stand-up comedy. Its strategy is market-based, not revenue-driven\u200a\u2014\u200ait needs to grow and grow and grow against the perception of success. How Netflix Took Over Stand-up ComedyWith new specials coming from Dave Chappelle, Amy Schumer, and Chris Rock, Netflix has officially taken over the stand\u2026theringer.com But Sarandos\u2019s global conqueror routine is also a boon for filmmakers. Netflix\u2019s insatiable appetite for library-building and content delivery has meant an unceasing, well, stream of new television shows, documentaries, and, increasingly, original feature films delivered to the world. With Blair\u2019s I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, Netflix unofficially began a new initiative: releasing one new original movie on its streaming service every Friday. Last Friday, it debuted Win It All, the charming new Joe Swanberg movie starring, coproduced, and cowritten by Jake Johnson. The 35-year-old Swanberg has become a kind of paterfamilias of indie cinema in the 10-plus years he\u2019s been making movies. But recently, the visibility of everything he\u2019s made has been elevated on a streaming service. \u201cDrinking Buddies honestly found its biggest audience on Netflix,\u201d Swanberg tells me after the premiere of Win It All at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. \u201cIt\u2019s become pretty clear to me over the last few years that the work that I\u2019m making is finding its audience there. And so I have [to face] the question as a filmmaker and Jake [Johnson] and I as business partners: Do we go where the audience is or do we make the audience come to us? I just think it\u2019s not our nature, we\u2019re not the kind of guys that are going to put our foot down and be like, \u2018No, you have to experience it this way.\u2019 If there\u2019s a big audience over there that wants to watch it, and we already made the movie we want, that makes the most sense to both of us.\u201d Win It All, like Swanberg\u2019s previous Netflix-distributed films Digging for Fire and Drinking Buddies, was made for less than $5 million and grossed far less than that; these are movies you can, and maybe should, stream. They are stylistically sturdy but unglamorous and crafted with a workaday mien that suits their makers. They glide, but they don\u2019t necessarily soar. Netflix is the perfect home for them. And it\u2019s the only place Swanberg and Johnson took a rough cut of Win It All, the only partner they were interested in. Swanberg has even expanded to TV with the anthology series Easy (also exclusively available and paid for by Netflix), which resembles the style of his movies. A second season is already in production. Its success insinuates an emerging aesthetic: Netflix-core. Soon, there may be no movies and TV, only Netflix and Amazon and other streaming bankrolled product. In the meantime, for an artist like Swanberg with a modest background and limited reach to this point, the collaboration is a win, no matter the length or form. \u201cAfter making Easy, where the show goes up on the same day to 170 countries all around the world, Netflix called me and they were like, \u2018It did really well in America. It also did really well in France and Germany,\u2019\u201d Swanberg says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve been trying for a decade to break into [those countries]. I knew they would like my stuff. It\u2019s just that they never had a chance to see it because a French distributor and a German distributor is like, \u2018I\u2019m not about to lose $300,000 trying to turn French people on to mumblecore movies. I got better things to do with my time.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that it wasn\u2019t about the work necessarily,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt was about the accessibility of the work. And the truth is, I don\u2019t have any grudge against that French distributor or German distributor. I wouldn\u2019t even put my movies out in those countries. It\u2019s a losing proposition. But with the Netflix access, those people finally had a chance to see my work and they were like, \u2018We like it!\u2019 Now we get to go back to them and say, \u2018Check this one out.\u2019\u201d Swanberg is an artistic pragmatist who has found a distribution partner that suits his pragmatism. Swanberg and Johnson, who made his name as one of the stars of Fox\u2019s New Girl, throw their own money in together for these projects\u200a\u2014\u200aand they both speak forthrightly about upending the financial models of moviemaking, finding ways to get the most money to the people most responsible for their creative execution. It\u2019s an intriguing anti-Hollywood populism, crafted by a mumblecore pioneer and a sitcom star\u200a\u2014\u200athe duo have formed a sort of modern-day Robert Altman\u2013Elliott Gould\u2013style pairing. Johnson\u200a\u2014\u200awho was featured in Jurassic World and has a part in the upcoming Mummy reboot starring Tom Cruise\u200a\u2014\u200ais particularly intimate with the corporate machinery that can envelope a creative project. \u201cWe get to cut out all middlemen and just make work and say, \u2018Do you guys like it? Guess what it\u2019s going to cost you: Nothing, you already have a subscription. So try it! And guess what, click on it, you already pay for Netflix,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou either know Joe through Easy and his stuff or you go, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Schmidt from New Girl, should I watch that? That\u2019s not Schmidt! Oh, it\u2019s the other one.\u2019 Just hit it. And you start it and if in those first few minutes, you\u2019re out, I get it. But if you\u2019re in, and you like it, then that\u2019s actually the fan we want who then goes, \u2018What else have they done?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, let\u2019s just make movies for that person and say, \u2018Yeah, you want to watch this one again?\u2019 You just put your baby to sleep, you got two hours before it starts crying, here\u2019s an hour and a half. And that\u2019s a model I\u2019m very personally excited about.\u201d At the SXSW screening that premiered Win It All, the crowd was uproarious\u200a\u2014\u200aJohnson and Swanberg told me that they always planned to first show the movie at Austin\u2019s Paramount Theatre, which treats movies more like rock concerts than Sunday Mass. So there is something odd about wanting audiences to experience the movie, which follows a hapless Chicago gambler who just so happens to come into the possession of a big bag of cash, at home on Netflix. For Netflix\u2019s part, the equation is still evolving. \u201cThere\u2019s a romantic notion about the film being on a big screen,\u201d said Sarandos last year. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about a premiere at [main Sundance venue] Eccles that you can\u2019t replicate\u200a\u2014\u200athat I can\u2019t replicate\u200a\u2014\u200abut the fact is, that happens for a couple hundred people once a year. We\u2019re doing it every day for the world. People who are discovering a movie that might change their life; that\u2019s who they\u2019re talking to. We have to get rid of the romantic part. I don\u2019t really think that they\u2019re mutually exclusive. I think over time that these films will get booked into theaters at the same time they\u2019re on Netflix.\u201d In the meantime, the freedom and scope of the opportunity provided by the company right now is often too much for young filmmakers to turn away from. Netflix\u2019s \u2018The Discovery\u2019 Has the Best Opening Scene of the YearThe director of the new high-concept sci-fi drama talks about the afterlife and how to draw in an audiencetheringer.com \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse. It\u2019s there in your home, it\u2019s on your phone, you can watch it anywhere,\u201d says Charlie McDowell, the director of The Discovery, another Netflix Original that premiered last month. \u201cBut I think that hopefully what this does, is people start talking about it on social media in a way that\u2019s intriguing and then it\u2019s like, \u2018Well, OK, I\u2019m just gonna go watch it on Netflix.\u2019\u201d McDowell\u2019s first movie, the twist-filled 2014 romantic drama The One I Love, also found an audience on Netflix, after a Sundance premiere. He didn\u2019t plan for The Discovery to live exclusively on Netflix. But there is some serendipity in the company\u2019s growth plans and his chance to show the biggest possible audience a meditative science fiction drama that may not scream \u201cbox office windfall.\u201d \u201cI set out for this movie to be seen in the theater, and then that changed in a way that I\u2019m totally OK with\u200a\u2014\u200aand the partnership with Netflix has been so successful and so strong and I really respect them and love what they\u2019re doing, especially this year with original films,\u201d McDowell says. \u201cThis is the year of original films breaking out for Netflix.\u201d Terry Crews, Ted Sarandos, and Adam Sandler at the premiere of \u2018Sandy Wexler\u2019 (Getty\u00a0Images) The service has effectively communicated its plan to filmmakers of all stripes. Later this year, it will release what would have otherwise been major studio pictures starring Brad Pitt (May\u2019s War Machine), Will Smith (December\u2019s Bright, from the director of Suicide Squad), and of course its never-ending string of Adam Sandler features, including this month\u2019s Sandy Wexler. But it\u2019s indie directors who stand to gain the most from the service\u2019s reach. \u201cThe only thing I care about is that people see this film. And a lot of people are gonna see this film just based on where it\u2019s available,\u201d McDowell says. \u201cMy friends made [the Netflix original series] The OA, which is something [where] if you go to a coffee shop, people are talking about it. And so you know that it hit. And so the next thing is: Can that translate to original films? Which I think for Netflix, that\u2019s the next territory.\u201d The protection that these films and filmmakers have from the terror of box office receipts perpetuates a mystery about their own success. Much like the television showrunners, network executives, and agents who have expressed concern over Netflix\u2019s refusal to share internal viewing metrics, filmmakers now have to trust that the corporate steward that has funded their vision and delivered it via a locked service is helping expand their careers, and not limiting them. This is unprecedented. How do we define a hit director in this environment? Will we know a Spielberg when we see one? McDowell acknowledges his metric for success is more ill-defined than ever. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna know the numbers of how many people have seen [The Discovery], obviously, but I feel like it\u2019ll just be, Are people talking about it on social media?\u201d McDowell says. \u201cAre people coming up to me saying, \u2018I saw your film and discovered it on Netflix\u2019? That\u2019s how I\u2019ll measure it, I guess.\u201d And what of the festival culture that heretofore announced major independent film talents? That lane is still open. But there are caveats. \u201cSundance actually does a very good job preparing you,\u201d says JD Dillard, whose debut feature, Sleight, played the festival in 2016 and will hit theaters on April 28. \u201cAnd so much of [what they told me] turned out to be true, which is crazy. We premiered on a Saturday and then starting Sunday, there are phone calls\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2018Oh, we\u2019re gonna do this,\u2019 and, \u2018We want to sit down with you, but we want to change these pieces,\u2019 and, \u2018We want to take it into direct to VOD, but here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna do it.\u2019 Other people were like, \u2018We\u2019ll just put it on the screen now.\u2019 There were some people who didn\u2019t want to touch it; there were some people who were like, \u2018What if we reshoot this piece?\u2019 All that is part of the conversation.\u201d \u201cWe were open to whatever anyone was saying,\u201d Dillard says. \u201cBut\u200a\u2014\u200aand maybe it\u2019s naive\u200a\u2014\u200awe wanted to see this movie in theaters. I understand that the distribution model is rapidly changing every single day and Netflix and Amazon are just as good as opening on 2,000 screens. But for this movie [theatrical distribution was the right choice], and honestly that was motivated by what the energy of Sleight was at the festival.\u201d Sleight follows a young street magician who gets caught up in a drug dealer\u2019s web and is forced to use some of his skills to escape\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a genre movie, craftily made on the cheap. Dillard previously worked at J.J. Abrams\u2019s Bad Robot as a receptionist and later as an assistant on the set of Star Wars: The Force Awakens with Abrams. His ambitions are big, wide-release stories, and he\u2019s reportedly been tapped to direct a remake of The Fly. But unlike Blair, Dillard has had to wait for more than 15 months for the public to see his movie. After brokering a deal with Blumhouse and WWE Films, Dillard entered a period when he was forced to resume his life and earn a living while tuning up his movie for its wide release. Few had seen Sleight and so momentum was difficult to come by. Artistic purgatory doesn\u2019t pay. \u201cHere\u2019s the not-so-glamorous side of independent film: All of my student loans defaulted, all my credit cards went into collections, I went back to Bad Robot to help my friends who are chefs there, to help them in the kitchen,\u201d says Dillard. \u201cSo I was doing whatever I could, but I still had to keep so much time open for Sleight, and that process sucks\u200a\u2014\u200alike, it really sucks. And that\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the nature of a low-budget [movie], where you can\u2019t just pay somebody 85 grand [to fix all your problems].\u201d There was no such interregnum for Macon Blair. \u201cIt seems to me like a cool way of doing things,\u201d Blair says of his movie\u2019s quick arrival on Netflix. \u201cIf the temperature is already up on a particular title to not let it cool off and then have to re-remind people about it nine months or 12 months later, just sort of strike while the iron is hot.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for us because now when I talk about these films, even at a dinner party, I don\u2019t have to go, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s right, you weren\u2019t at the festival,\u2019\u201d says John Cooper, longtime director of the Sundance Film Festival. \u201cThey become part of the dialogue of our independent community faster.\u201d Festival work is difficult, and requires thousands of hours of labor\u200a\u2014\u200awatching unfinished films, identifying themes, securing contracts, creating a schedule, building atmosphere, arranging countless screenings and panels. Sundance is a machine and the most respected festival of its kind, but that reputation has taken years to acquire and hold. It\u2019s human work. It feels like a strain that would be removed by an AI observing the movie business. Do the closed windows perpetrated by massive, studio-esque corporations obviate the need for film festivals in the first place? Cooper says no. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a need for us to be curatorial and for us to have\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t want to say the word \u2018pure\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200abut almost have that more noncommercial approach to selecting films and celebrating,\u201d he says. \u201cA noncommercial celebration is important. Even for Netflix.\u201d Twenty-five years ago, no one wanted to touch Reservoir Dogs. Not even Harvey Weinstein, the man who would become Quentin Tarantino\u2019s creative guardian angel. In his book Down and Dirty Pictures, the film industry historian Peter Biskind tracks the parallel arcs of Miramax, Sundance, and a crop of brash young filmmakers that included Tarantino. The Reservoir Dogs director, then a pugnacious 28-year-old video-store clerk and aspirant auteur, had recently felt the sting of rejection at Sundance, where his violent and narratively audacious debut won zero awards. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been such a bad thing if I hadn\u2019t been told by everybody I was gonna win\u200a\u2014\u200asomething. But it hurt my feelings,\u201d Tarantino told Biskind. \u201cI was sad, I was mad. When it was over I did a slightly less drastic version of storming out. \u2018Fuck all you!\u2019\u201d Reservoir Dogs, a pulpy and unlikely festival entrant, made an impression, but there wasn\u2019t much interest in distributing the movie. Biskind recounts the post-Sundance round of screenings to potential distributors: Twenty minutes into it, Harvey was getting a little itchy. [Mark] Tusk told him, \u201cSit still. Trust me.\u201d The movie ended. Harvey was dubious, afraid it would be a hard sell at the box office even if it got good reviews, which seemed questionable, given the carnage. Back in New York, the brothers screened it again, then went around the room, canvassing the staff. Ben Zinkin, an outside counsel, said, \u201cThat was probably the single worst movie I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \u201cRussell?\u201d Russell Schwartz, head of marketing, replied, \u201cNot my cup of tea. For me, it\u2019s a pass.\u201d Reservoir Dogs would not have gotten past theatrical distributors this year. But it also might not have been able to transcend its origins if it had been scooped up by a major streaming service. There\u2019s no way to know. Sundance showed 119 feature films this year. Forty-one have been sold thus far\u200a\u2014\u200aNetflix bought 10, Amazon Studios five. Those are by far the highest acquisition totals. They have completely replaced Miramax and Sony Picture Classics as the power brokers of the festival. \u201cThe people who are acquiring movies and putting together these deals are a lot of the people I knew back in the day from other companies,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a whole new set of people that are at Amazon, that are at Netflix. It\u2019s the same faces of a lot of people that helped create Miramax and other companies back in the day. So I find that interesting, too\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re still basically doing the same kind of job. It\u2019s just for a different platform.\u201d Some say there is reason to be cautious about the long-term viability of this wave. \u201cThere\u2019s a window right now where they\u2019re all trying to fill up, but at some point, Amazon will have enough titles and all they\u2019ll care about are the big ones that are coming up,\u201d the producer Chris Moore, whose Manchester by the Sea was funded and distributed by Amazon Studios, told me last fall. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a subscriber of Prime, which is what they care about, do you care if they have 50,000 titles or 6 million? As long as you get what you want out of the 50,000, what are you going to do with that other 5 million titles, right? They\u2019re just going to sit there.\u201d Netflix and Amazon\u2019s surge presents complications for independent producers and filmmakers, too. Is this an endless waterfall of acquisition and distribution? Or will the water run dry? \u201cThe biggest problem is what you\u2019re selling when you make movies\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s a studio or a guy like me raising independent money\u200a\u2014\u200ais you\u2019re selling the potential of a hit,\u201d says Moore. \u201cYou\u2019re selling that the business and my experience in the business gives you a higher-percentage chance that you\u2019re going to get your money back. And I don\u2019t think you can sell any of that anymore.\u201d Ted Hope and Casey Affleck at Amazon Studios\u2019 Oscars celebration (Getty\u00a0Images) It\u2019s a fascinating concept, a puzzle box dropped right in the middle of an industry that thrives on metric success, whether box office draw or award hauls. Manchester was an Oscar success story in winning awards for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay and reeled in $62 million at the box office worldwide, an impressive figure given its dark story line and provenance. Likewise, Amazon helped shepherd the small and heady James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro to profitability and an Oscar nomination. In just two-plus years, the biggest technology and consumer marketplace company has scaled Hollywood credibility. It\u2019s done so, in part, by playing by traditional rules. Just last week at a keynote discussion at MIPTV in Cannes, Amazon Studios head of media development Roy Price praised the value of theatrical distribution in its movie strategy: \u201cWhatever you may predict to happen six or seven years from now, theaters play an important role in the movie ecosystem now, so why not participate in that?\u00a0\u2026 Once the movie comes on the service having been in theaters, I think there is a perception that it\u2019s a legit movie: It was reviewed, and it was in a theater\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s like, a movie. It helps with customer perception, it helps with filmmakers, so we\u2019re very supportive of the theatrical window.\u201d That sentiment is still powerful for a filmmaker like James Gray, who has released five films with independent distributors. His new movie, the gorgeous period adventure The Lost City of Z, will be distributed by Amazon Studios. He wants his movies in theaters. \u201cTen years ago, I\u2019d give interviews and we\u2019d talk about the future of cinema and I felt very much like a Cassandra,\u201d Gray says. \u201cMovies reflected a temporary moment. People assume that art forms last forever. But let\u2019s face it: If you were a composer of opera, you would be in deep trouble. Opera was a popular medium in 1860 or 1870 and when Verdi died, 400,000 lined the streets of Rome for his funeral. And today you can go to the opera, but you dress up and it\u2019s $300 for a great seat, which is crazy. And who can pay that? It\u2019s become a rarefied thing. And I started to see that movies, the tradition where you go and sit in the theater and pay your money and eat your popcorn, enjoy that as a communal experience, that that was under grave threat. This was 10 years ago. I don\u2019t think that anything I\u2019ve said then was disproven by anything happening now. I think where we\u2019re headed, which is a world that is [dictated by] Amazon and Netflix, is essentially you watch these things at home on your 60- or 70-inch television. I\u2019m against that.\u201d Netflix has announced at least 20 more original films that will be released on its service this year, ranging in size from Sundance to Sandler. Amazon Studios is newer to the field, releasing one film in 2015 and 15 last year, including major achievements, like Park Chan-wook\u2019s The Handmaiden and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson, that would otherwise have been forced to find distribution with one of the boutique distribution houses. Amazon has 14 films planned for this year, including production and distribution for Todd Haynes\u2019s followup to Carol, Wonderstruck, as well as Richard Linklater\u2019s Last Flag Flying, a sequel to The Last Detail starring Bryan Cranston; it produced, and will co-distribute, Doug Liman\u2019s John Cena\u2013starring The Wall with Roadside Attractions; it also picked up distribution for the Sundance darling The Big Sick. Amazon\u2019s strategy, overseen by Price, Head of World Wide Film Jason Ropell, and Head of Motion Picture Production Ted Hope, is an amalgam that is driven by taste and inbound experience. Hope, whose Good Machine Films production company was a driving force in \u201990s indie cinema, has brought 30 years of knowledge to Amazon. He\u2019s an idealist in a confusing environment. \u201cI really do believe that we, the creative community, are on the precipice of what I think will be the greatest period in filmmaking ever,\u201d Hope said last summer at the Seattle Film Festival. \u201cI know you all want to know about the secret Amazon algorithms for how we pick our films and spend money.\u00a0\u2026 I constantly say, \u2018Why do movies suck? Why are these scripts just not better?\u2019 This is my first pass at talking about how we can engineer better movies.\u201d Hope buys what he likes, and what he thinks can work, but he\u2019s begun blending social media observation and digital data tracking with gut-level decision-making. He\u2019s an Amazon man now. \u201cI have a personal aesthetic of appreciating noble failures,\u201d he said last summer. \u201cAs a student, I learn when it doesn\u2019t work; it helps me as an artist. But I know the audience doesn\u2019t like those, so as an executive, I can\u2019t really go out and try to spend my money on noble failures.\u201d Sometimes that results in a Todd Haynes movie. Sometimes it\u2019s a John Cena war flick. And sometimes it\u2019s a remake of a giallo horror classic, like Luca Guadagnino\u2019s upcoming reimagining of Dario Argento\u2019s Suspiria. Movies are still a mystery, a shot in the dark. But some fear that the unknown is evaporating from the equation. \u201cI have a bunch of young filmmakers who come to me and they say, \u2018Hey, I made a movie for $800,000 and people like it and it\u2019s getting a small, theatrical release, which is actually costing me money, and then I made this deal with Netflix for $300,000,\u2019\u201d says Chris Moore. \u201cSo the next time they go do it, they figure, that movie was pretty good, everybody seemed to like it, all we got was $300,000 from Netflix, so I got to make the next one for $300,000.\u201d Just as the viewership data is locked for these movies, so are the budgets. The raft of small films that have been bought and paid for by Netflix enforce a new kind of relationship that more closely resembles the old studio-contractor model that employed actors in the 1930s and \u201940s: Netflix owns everything. There are no DVD sales, no international receipts, no TV syndication deals. The only difference is the absence of the creative shackles that Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner employed. Swanberg returns to Netflix because he likes what he hears from the company and the financial security it provides. McDowell likes the reach. Blair likes the ease of use. The appeal of Netflix, and its war chest, is incalculable right now. Ted Sarandos is evasive about the financial impact of spending at will and flooding the market with content. His is a scale-building pursuit, the vision of a seemingly never-ending library, each title opening with its very own cherry red, animated Netflix logo at the start. \u201cWe don\u2019t spend any time talking about Wall Street when we do content acquisition deals,\u201d Sarandos said last year. \u201cIt serves our model probably in the same way it does to make a season of House of Cards. It\u2019s about making content that people love, value and associate their Netflix membership with. So when they say, \u2018I\u2019m a subscriber to Netflix because I love Orange Is the New Black,\u2019 or, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to see The Crown,\u2019 they know they can\u2019t do it anywhere else. \u201cMovies, it\u2019s tough to have the same economics because it\u2019s two hours of watching instead of 13 hours. But [the forthcoming Will Smith film] Bright is a movie that they would have seen in the theater, yet because they\u2019re Netflix members they get to watch it whenever they want, wherever they want, at the same moment. There\u2019s no window, no waiting. The producers will make money, and they chose this over the other models. They didn\u2019t do it because they had a point to prove or they had any interest in Netflix\u2019s value market gap. They did it because this was a more profitable way to make and release movies. Our first ambition is that it becomes like a major studio slate.\u201d For Netflix, that means more, bigger, and wider. But it also means being everything. To be a major movie studio is to serve every so-called quadrant, to market-test and research human interest. And to take chances inside of that research. \u201cSo when I say I think about it as a slate, I think about it both in volume and scope from a couple of tentpoles, some nice films in the middle, and some great independent,\u201d Sarandos said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really excited about is our original films that we\u2019re producing.\u201d What Sarandos does provide\u200a\u2014\u200awhat differentiates him from, say, Harvey Weinstein\u200a\u2014\u200ais full-blown creative control to his filmmakers. Every single filmmaker I\u2019ve spoken with this year has testified to the astonishing freedom the companies provide. \u201cIf you disagree with a note from Netflix or Amazon, you can have a creative discussion about it,\u201d Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino recently told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s not viewed as, \u2018You didn\u2019t take my notes? You\u2019re an enemy and I\u2019m going to cancel your show.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done this one time and I don\u2019t know if my experience is different from other people\u2019s experience, but from what I saw, the sort of creative freedom that was given to me is a really, really attractive feature to this model,\u201d says Macon Blair. \u201cAnd also the fact that they can get down with stuff that, for whatever reason\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s the cast or the content or the subject matter\u200a\u2014\u200amight not be viable for other places.\u201d Netflix closing the door for dozens of theatergoing opportunities is a strange conundrum. Would I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore work better in a theater with 200 people? Maybe. But what\u2019s lost in it not appearing on that venue? Blair says the opportunity outweighs the loss. \u201cI\u2019m not slamming the more theatrical-based distributors either,\u201d Blair says.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s just a different set of conditions that have to be met, which is totally valid, but I think it opens up more space that filmmakers who might not otherwise be able to get something done, like in this case me, to be able to do something. \u201cJeremy [Saulnier] has a movie [Hold the Dark] that he\u2019s working on right now which is much, much bigger than mine and much bigger than anything that he\u2019s done before. [It\u2019s] also going to be on Netflix, and I can\u2019t say this with any kind of certainty, but I would guess, because the script is very dark and kind of weird and challenging, that Netflix might have been able to confidently take a chance with it in a way that other places wouldn\u2019t. The movie is right in Jeremy\u2019s wheelhouse, so I think fans of his will really enjoy it, but it may not have happened if not for Netflix rolling the dice on it.\u201d Not everyone is so bullish on the future foretold by this brave new independent cinema. Despite the overwhelming opportunity Amazon and Netflix provide, a duopoly is not a democracy. The biases of the people who curate the experiences on these services could dictate the shape of small-scale moviemaking for decades to come. The Teds Hope and Sarandos have proved artist-first executives so far, but that is not a guaranteed future. And furthermore, how long will the Big Two pursue smaller films at this rate? If Bright is an internal mega-hit for Netflix, in the same way the service claims that Sandler\u2019s films are, does that mean a Disney-level pursuit is in the offing? Though it has failed in its efforts thus far, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Netflix muscles its way into the last great movie market: China. Which means more spectacle, more action-based storytelling, and certainly fewer indie-centric acquisitions. China Will Not Save HollywoodProjections about the box office future of China\u200a\u2014\u200aand Hollywood reactions like \u2018The Great Wall\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200amay be shortsightedtheringer.com For James Gray, there is a sadness in his experience. His career has been marked by notoriously frustrating encounters with distributors, difficulties marketing his films, and public quarreling with Harvey Weinstein over their content. But even as he finally reaps the benefits of working with a company like Amazon, and as he awaits the release of The Lost City of Z, his most ambitious and uncompromising film, he\u2019s melancholy. \u201cI mourn\u00a0\u2026 I got into movies in 1987 when I started in college in USC film school. And when I graduated in 1991, the scene was still very much the same as it had been in 1935,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt was actually better than it was in 1935, because you would make your film and then it would come out on videotape. And a few years later on DVD. So it had a life that wasn\u2019t only in theaters. So in that sense, it\u2019s better. We can discover these films for years to come. And it can find new audiences. \u201cBut the major negative,\u201d he says, \u201cis that intimacy\u200a\u2014\u200athat womblike intimacy\u200a\u2014\u200athat we have with the screen, no longer speaks to us.\u201d ", "parent": "", "title": "The End of Independent Film As We Know\u00a0It", "child": "23_1\t23_2\t23_3\t23_4\t23_5\t23_6\t23_7\t23_8\t23_9\t23_10\t23_11\t23_12\t23_13\t23_14\t23_15\t23_16\t23_17\t23_18\t23_19", "name": "23"}
