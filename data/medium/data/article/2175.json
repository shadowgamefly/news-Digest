That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find a niche in whatever it is you aim to build or build something better than the world has ever seen. The Illusion of Limited Resources I\u2019m always working as though there\u2019s a finish line and if I don\u2019t get there first someone else will; they\u2019ll win the prize, they\u2019ll take the business I would have won, make the money I would have made, get the rewards I would have received and then there will be nothing left for me or anyone else. This attitude creates an anticipatory anxiety that is neither good for business or personal health. It also happens to be a false premise. The truth is there is always enough to go around for everyone. The belief that there are limited resources and/or opportunities for each of us to be successful is the very belief that will keep success at bay. Here are the 4 reasons why, along with ways you can counteract getting in your own way. The Self-Serving Bias This bias is the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to our own behavior and negative outcomes to external factors. It is a great way to exonerate yourself and blame the world for why you didn\u2019t get what you want. For example, your business scores a huge sale and you think, \u201cI did this!\u201d Conversely, your business doesn\u2019t score the huge sale and you think, \u201cThey/that did this to me!\u201d It is a self-preservation technique to protect your ego. This is biased thinking, meaning it is flawed, and it mentally places the responsibility for your life into the hands of others rather than yourself, even though\u200a\u2014\u200aultimately\u200a\u2014\u200ait is always you who is to credit for your successes and your failures. Protecting your ego is nice but it also prevents you from seeing the facts, dealing with them and having the information you need to make better decisions. When you start blaming, you start losing. Blame creates a feeling of helplessness, that despite your best efforts the world was out to thwart you, so what\u2019s the point. If you feel like everything is futile and there\u2019s no point in pursuing your goals because clearly the world wants to see you fall then you will not have the motivation and willpower to do anything but live a status quo life. You\u2019ll make a living, go through the motions, and in the end hand over the keys to your self-worth to the external world. To persevere you need to keep your willpower intact. And to keep your willpower intact you need to stay motivated. Your Beliefs Affect Your Energy\u00a0Level We begin each day with a full reserve of willpower and as we go through the day and make choices, do our work, complete tasks and so on, our willpower is depleted. It behooves us to keep our willpower reserve as in tact as possible so that we can stay focused and accomplish our goals. A 2011 study performed by Kathleen D. Vohs, Roy F. Baumeister, and Brandon J. Schmeichel did a study on the effect of our beliefs and motivations on ego depletion. According to the study, \u201cWhen the [ego] depletion is slight, there is ample and profound room for subjective beliefs and motivations to moderate the effects\u201d but also that \u201cno person can continue running or swimming forever no matter how much he or she may be motivated.\u201d Meaning, if we are only mildly depleted and we maintain strong self-efficacy we can keep that fatigue from overpowering us. Conversely, if we lack self-efficacy, the fatigue can gain momentum and further deplete our willpower. But at a certain point of exhaustion it doesn\u2019t matter how much we believe in ourselves. So, if you\u2019re extremely exhausted it will not matter if you believe someone else\u2019s success has erased your potential, but if you\u2019re not extremely exhausted\u200a\u2014\u200athe state in which we all typically begin our days\u200a\u2014\u200athen believing someone else\u2019s success has erased your potential can have a deleterious effect on your willpower, energy level, and ability to stay focused and accomplish your goals. It thus stands to reason that you might as well give yourself the best chance you can by A) getting the rest you need and B) starting your day motivated, believing there is a space for you in this world to be successful and achieve your goals. I want to drive home the point that motivation and self-efficacy can keep your ego depletion at bay. Image courtesy of\u00a0Unsplash Nothing Begets\u00a0Nothing There are unlimited resources for the things we don\u2019t want to come true. A backwards example of how momentum creates the goals you aspire to achieve is the fact that believing it can\u2019t happen creates the reality where it doesn\u2019t happen. We build whole lives where things we want don\u2019t happen because we don\u2019t try to make them happen because we believe they won\u2019t happen whether we do or don\u2019t try. That in itself is proof of success: we\u2019ve become very good at proving nothing will happen with zero effort. The reverse is also true: things happen when you work to make them happen. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Be smart about it, work diligently, get a coach or advisor, learn from others that have done it already, and get crackin\u2019. Keep Your Eyes to\u00a0Yourself You want to stay focused while you\u2019re building your career or business or working towards a goal. What does wishing you had what others do have to do with your goals? You have a limited amount of energy given to you each day and you want to use that wisely. You will be shooting yourself in the foot if you expend your energy on what you don\u2019t have, or focusing on what others have. Instead, use your energy to focus on what you want and what you\u2019re grateful you have already. This strengthens the foundation you\u2019ve already created and builds upon it for what you want to come to you in the future. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that every idea is a winner. Failure is part of life, but the path to failure is part of the path towards success. You\u2019ll learn what to do and not do for the next venture. The key is to start, stay focused, with your eye on the prize, and put in the effort. I\u2019d love to hear about your own experiences, thoughts, and beliefs for clear thinking. Please share!
