{"name": "1544", "parent": "", "content": "Trump promised an official voter fraud investigation, then delegated it to a guy on\u00a0Twitter There is no credible evidence of significant patterns of voter fraud in the\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump spent a lot of his first week in office re-litigating his election victory. In one of his first meetings with Congress, he claimed\u200a\u2014\u200awithout evidence\u200a\u2014\u200athat 3 to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, which he lost by nearly 3 million to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Quickly, some observers pointed out that if Trump genuinely believed that to be true, he would be derelict in his duty if he didn\u2019t order a massive voter fraud investigation. So Trump promised one. He repeated the promise to ABC\u2019s David Muir in an interview on Wednesday: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna launch an investigation to find out. And then the next time\u200a\u2014\u200aand I will say this, of those votes cast, none of \u2019em come to me. None of \u2019em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of \u2019em come to me,\u201d said President Trump. The official announcement came on Thursday via Sean Spicer: President Trump would be signing an executive order on voter fraud that day. \u201cIt will be a follow up on the announcement yesterday of his commitment to better understand voter fraud, faulty registration, et cetera,\u201d Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One. Within a day of the promised official investigation, however, Trump backed off. Instead of promising an official government action, he pointed to a Gregg Phillips\u200a\u2014\u200athe source of the two unverified tweets in November that seem to have set Trump off on his \u201c3\u20135 million\u201d vote spree. Months later, Phillips has yet to show anyone evidence for his claim, or explain how he arrived at his 3 million number. Now, Phillips is at the center of an investigation into what would be\u200a\u2014\u200aif his claims were true\u200a\u2014\u200athe largest incidence of voter fraud in U.S. history, evidence that would shake the foundations of the country\u2019s democracy. And President Trump is putting this investigation in the hands of a volunteer voter-fraud activist, and shining a spotlight on whatever he finds. The trajectory of the unverified \u20183 million vote\u2019\u00a0claim On November 13th, Phillips tweeted this: Phillips notably claimed that he \u201cverified\u201d the illegal votes four days before any states certified their election results (Vermont was the first). Nonetheless, his tweet went viral in certain right-wing spheres. InfoWars, a well-known conspiracy site that has also claimed that the Sandy Hook Massacre was a hoax and 9/11 was an inside job, wrote up Phillips\u2019 Tweet as a claim and argued that all those votes went to Hillary Clinton. Then popular right-wing aggregator Drudge Report picked up InfoWars\u2019 article (which, incidentally cites \u201cGreg Phillips of the VoteFraud.org organization.\u201d That URL now goes to Election Night Gatekeepers, who say they\u2019d \u201cnever heard of\u201d Phillips before Drudge started sending them traffic by the thousands). Then, Trump started repeating the claim. Trump\u2019s lie about illegal votes will have dangerous consequencesSixteen states are already working on legislation to suppress voters this year.thinkprogress.org To recap: In the span of a week, \u201c3 million illegal votes\u201d went from an unverified tweet, to an Infowars article, to Drudge report, to the President-elect\u2019s new favorite talking point. Now it\u2019s January, and Trump is still fixated on the fact that he lost the popular vote, and using Phillips\u2019 \u201c3 million votes\u201d to back up his personal theory that he didn\u2019t. As CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter pointed out, Trump\u2019s tweet about waiting for Phillips\u2019 report came about 45 minutes after Phillips was on CNN, where the host grilled him. There is no credible evidence of voter fraud on a massive or even significant scale in the United States, so any official government investigation would be extremely unlikely to find any. Phillips is the only one claims to have evidence of any sort to back Trump up. No one has seen any of the data Phillips claims to have been using, nor the algorithm he and his team are using. Phillips stressed to The Daily Beast that he and his team are all volunteers. He made his claim based on a database collected by the conservative vote-monitoring group True the Vote (which was the subject of a congressional investigation for voter suppression in 2012). The head of that group told The Daily Beast that his original tweet was \u201cbased on his independent analysis.\u201d Phillips may well be conducting an investigation into voter fraud. But it is not the credible, official government investigation Trump implied was coming. Yet Trump is suggesting he will take Phillips\u2019 investigation as truth and possibly use it to form policy\u200a\u2014\u200aor, at the very least, drive headlines. The Trump bait and\u00a0switch The trajectory of this story fits into what has become a well worn pattern when it comes to Trump media coverage. When Spicer first announced the voter fraud investigation, the headlines rolled out: \u201cTrump to sign executive action on voter fraud,\u201d read CBS. \u201cTrump considers executive order on voter fraud,\u201d read CNN. Then, Thursday night, the executive order was unceremoniously pulled. \u201cThe president got back a little late and he got jammed up on some meetings that needed to occur, and so we\u2019re going to roll all that into Friday and Saturday,\u201d Spicer said. It\u2019s possible that Trump will return to his executive order on voter fraud, and launch an expensive and potentially damaging investigation. But Spicer\u2019s comments were also vague\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201call that\u201d could refer to any executive orders, and its unclear that they will actually include the promised investigation. The details of the Carrier deal have finally been released. Trump exaggerated big league.Trump ignored the United Steelworkers, handed a big tax break to management, then claimed an exaggerated victory.thinkprogress.org In either case, Trump promised to sign an executive order on voter fraud on Thursday\u200a\u2014\u200athen didn\u2019t deliver. This was largely overlooked by the media: Most outlets folded the new development into their earlier articles, but retained the headlines promising the investigation. This cycle often shows up in Trump\u2019s media strategy: First, he makes a claim\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as his inflation of the amount of jobs Carrier would be retaining in Indiana. The press reports the claim, spawning headlines that reiterate his unverified statement. Then, hours or days later, the actual details come out, often showing that his claim was wrong or exaggerated. But it\u2019s too late\u200a\u2014\u200ahis false statement is already out there. The news cycle has moved on, and even when reporters do come back to fact check the details, Trump\u2019s supporters are still likely to believe his earlier statement. On his first day in office, Trump broke 34 promisesThe new president made 36 promises about his first day, but kept only two of them.thinkprogress.org It\u2019s a remarkably effective strategy for Trump; it enables him to build hype with bluster and create the impression that he\u2019s engaged in a flurry of activity, fulfilling all of his promises. In reality, Trump isn\u2019t (thus far) living up to the huge policy plans he promised\u200a\u2014\u200aduring his campaign, for example, he promised to accomplish 36 specific things on his first day. He fulfilled two of those promises. Trump\u2019s voter fraud investigation is another example. It may be that we will still see an executive order on a voter fraud investigation; perhaps it really was just delayed. But in any case, Trump already has the headlines he wanted, and somewhere down the line, Phillips may deliver the data. How accurate or official that data will be is another story entirely.
