Now, a new rumor emerges about the Knicks attempting to complete a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers. And, crucially, the teams are scrambling to find a third team to keep the trade talks afloat. Via Ramona Shelburne and Marc Stein: The New York Knicks and LA Clippers are searching for third-team facilitators to keep alive the prospect of completing a Carmelo Anthony trade, according to league sources.\u00a0\u2026The most substantive talks between the teams took place last week, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions, but have continued into this week as the Clippers have maintained a consistent interest in Anthony, who has two years and roughly $53 million remaining on his contract. (via ESPN.com) Okay so maybe that leak about the Knicks being content without a super stud like Blake Griffin or Chris Paul and take guys like Austin Rivers and Jamal Crawford (#OAKAAK) are not valid. I mean, come on, that would be foolish to not get a bona fide star or a first round pick for Carmelo and\u2026oh man that is exactly something the Knickerbockers would do isn\u2019t it? So we\u2019ll keep an eye on the situation for you. It\u2019s really a strange time, I honestly thought \u2018Melo would remain a Knick until the end of his contract. Now it seems as though he could be moved before the trade deadline on February 23rd. We\u2019ll keep you updated if anymore trade rumors present themselves or anything more drastic. \u2014 Reid Goldsmith, managing editor Follow The Knicks Wall on Facebook and Twitter and listen to the TKW Podcast on SoundCloud.
