{"name": "167", "parent": "", "content": "An Ivy League of Their\u00a0Own Only Cubs fans know the antidote to a century\u2019s worth of despair: 108 years worth of\u00a0hope. My story is not unique. It\u2019s not special or one-off. It\u2019s one of a million\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s one you can only begin to understand if you\u2019re a member of the most agonizing fraternity in sports. I was born on October 5, 1992, in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb 30 miles west of Chicago. When the doctors finally got me out, I was crying. Not because I was a newborn baby and that\u2019s what newborn babies do, but because the Cubs finished 78\u201384 and missed the playoffs that started the next day. Like every true Cubs fan, I didn\u2019t choose to bleed Cubbies blue: I was born into it. After getting married, my parents\u2019 first place was an apartment on legendary Waveland Avenue. They and their friends spent countless summer days on their apartment\u2019s roof, lounging in lawn chairs, drinking cold beers and watching their beloved Cubs. My mom\u2019s cousin, Scot Thompson, was drafted by the Cubs with the seventh overall pick in the 1974 MLB Draft. He eventually made it to The Show, where he played six years for the Cubs, batted\u00a0.255 as a first baseman and outfielder and finished third in the 1979 NL Rookie of the Year voting. So when I was born, the love and passion for the Cubs was passed down to me like a hereditary disease\u200a\u2014\u200aa disease that hasn\u2019t been cured in 108 years. Since the Cubs dominated the Tigers four games to one in the 1908 World Series, we\u2019ve made it back just once and have single-handedly debunked the \u201cblind squirrel theory.\u201d We\u2019ve seen billy goats, black cats and Bartman, but have been deprived the tears-inducing image that would be the Cubs hoisting the World Series trophy. We dream, yes, but we dwell even more. That\u2019s one of the roughest side effects of being a Cubs fan: We forget nothing. People often ask me how I can be such a diehard Cub fan after so many years of losing. How can we continue to uphold such unmatched affection for a team that has caused us so much pain? Because it\u2019s not just our pain: It\u2019s generations of pain. The losses, the heartbreak, the turmoil and meltdowns\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re not just a part of us. They\u2019ve been handed down for generations like a contaminated family heirloom. Posing on my parents\u2019 old rooftop, with the view now obscured, slightly, by 21st-century corporate signage. The landlord is the same woman from whom my parents rented the place, and she still lets us up onto the roof whenever we\u00a0visit. This year\u2026 this year, we\u2019ve got all the tools to find that cure that\u2019s been missing for over a century. A fearsome lineup led by two MVP candidates. A pitching staff with two aces and the lowest collective ERA in the MLB. The league\u2019s best defense and the game\u2019s best manager. So with such a loaded team, why the continued, deep, and even amplified worry? Because of the decades of memories that resurface every October like a monster in a bad horror movie. No matter how hard we try, we can\u2019t shake the nerves and anxiety. Sure, we were up 2\u20130 going into Game 3 of the NLDS\u200a\u2014\u200aa lead that would have most fans feeling secure. But then the Giants shell Aroldis Chapman, we lose Game 3, and immediately the series seems to be over. Go down 2\u20131 to the Dodgers in the NLCS and we\u2019re convinced we\u2019ll never get another hit and lose the series in five. Two days and two wins later, we\u2019re back to the best team in baseball and certain we\u2019ll win it all. The next morning, I\u2019m already thinking about the last time we went back to Chicago up 3\u20132 with two chances to finally get back to the Fall Classic\u00a0\u2026 and the fear comes flooding back. But this isn\u2019t 2003. We jump all over Kershaw from the hop, Lester throws another gem, and we party like it\u2019s 1945. I wake up the next morning and instantly remind myself of two things. One: THE CHICAGO CUBS ARE IN THE F\u200a\u2014\u200aING WORLD\u00a0SERIES! Two: We still have four games to win against a team that\u2019s lost once this postseason and is led by a manager who is 8\u20130 in the World\u00a0Series. Am I certain that this our year? You better damn believe it. Am I horrified that we\u2019ll fall short yet again, even with every single piece to get it done? Absolutely. But that\u2019s what being a devout Cubbie is all about\u200a\u2014\u200asoaking up a beautiful Chicago summer\u2019s day with an ice cold Old Style in Wrigley\u2019s sun-drenched bleachers. Passing a fellow Cubs fan on the street and becoming immediate friends through a simple \u201cGo Cubbies\u201d exchange. Believing with every fiber of our being that this actually IS the year. No matter how many times they break our hearts, make us cry or shatter our dreams, our love and support never waver. Instead, it grows as each year passes. Because it\u2019s not just about baseball, or sports fandom. It\u2019s about sharing some of our most cherished experiences with family, friends, fellow fans, and people we love the most. Next year is here. Fly The W. The Ronans: Cubbies fans \u2019til the day we\u00a0die.
