{"name": "565", "parent": "", "content": "Alternate Living It\u2019s about Cheetos and a Happy Meal, a banquet of the Gods. It\u2019s fluffy like a puppy and fresh falling snow as seen through a convenience store window. It\u2019s not about the suicide but the legacy. It\u2019s a ton of prescription drugs and their efficacy. It\u2019s the need to pump dirty sands through sacred lands. It\u2019s screw the people we have a business to run. It\u2019s overseas, we\u2019re outta here. It\u2019s less than you can live on but we get a raise every year. It\u2019s about what you have been led to believe and how easily you are deceived. It\u2019s the glint of hope encouraged by a lie that ignores your suffering cry. It\u2019s the spirit that is parched should life be an agonizing death march? Where is the underdog to save the day? Did he head for the coast? Is that what I heard someone say? In each of us it does reside we need to find it and not hide. It\u2019s a storm that raged forever, let\u2019s weather it together.
