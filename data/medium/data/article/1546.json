CREDIT: AP\u00a0Photo In a brief order handed down Monday evening, a federal district court held that Texas\u2019 voter ID law was \u201cpassed, at least in part, with a discriminatory intent in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u201d Voter ID laws are a common method of voter suppression that disproportionately target voters of color. According to data cited by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will hear any appeal of Monday\u2019s order, in Texas \u201cBlacks were 1.78 times more likely than Whites, and Latinos 2.42 times more likely, to lack\u201d voter ID. The Fifth Circuit previously held that Texas\u2019 law had a greater impact on minority voters than on whites, a fact that in and of itself makes the law illegal under the Voting Rights Act. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s Monday order is significant for two reasons. First, as voting rights expert Rick Hasen notes, if the district court\u2019s order is upheld on appeal, \u201cit would be grounds for throwing out the entire law (and not just softening it though an affidavit requirement, etc.).\u201d Additionally, while a 5\u20134 Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2012\u200a\u2014\u200athe provision requiring certain states to submit any new election procedures to federal authorities for review before those procedures can take effect\u200a\u2014\u200aa separate provision of the Voting Rights Act permits states that engage in intentional voting discrimination to be brought back under federal supervision. New study confirms that voter ID laws are very racistBut the Supreme Court probably won\u2019t care.thinkprogress.org Monday\u2019s order in Veasey v. Abbott notes several factors that suggest the law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos, including the law\u2019s disparate impact on these voters and the fact that state lawmakers rushed the state\u2019s voter ID law \u201cthrough the legislative process without the usual committee analysis, debate, and substantive consideration of amendments.\u201d The court also noted that, \u201cTexas had become a majority-minority state\u201d with \u201cpolarized voting patterns allowing the suppression of the overwhelmingly Democratic votes of African\u2013Americans and Latinos to provide an Anglo partisan advantage.\u201d The state\u2019s Republican legislature, in other words, could use race as a proxy for partisan affiliation. By passing a law that would disproportionately target African Americans and Latinos, lawmakers could protect Republican rule. Additionally, while Texas claimed that its law exists to prevent voter fraud, not to disenfranchise voters of color, \u201cthe evidence shows a tenuous relationship between those rationales and the actual terms of the bill.\u201d Of the 20 million votes cast in the ten years before this law\u2019s passage, only two people were convicted by the kind of voter fraud that is supposedly targeted by voter ID. So Monday\u2019s order is good news for voting rights supporters, but it is also good news that is likely to be short lived. Although the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019 law violates the Voting Rights Act, it is also a very conservative court. The lawyers challenging this law have a tough road ahead of themselves before the appeals court. And even if their case survives contact with the Fifth Circuit, the case is still likely to be reviewed by a newly Gorsuched Supreme Court. Prior to the 2016 election, while the Supreme Court was still down a justice, all four of the Court\u2019s Republicans voted to reinstate North Carolina\u2019s omnibus voter suppression law\u200a\u2014\u200adespite a federal appeals court\u2019s determination that the law was intentionally designed to increase its impact on black voters and minimize its impact on white voters. With Donald Trump\u2019s nominee now occupying the Court\u2019s vacant seat, it is likely that there are now five votes to permit racially motivated voter suppression to move forward.
