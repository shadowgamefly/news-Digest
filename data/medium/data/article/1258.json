Not only do we not value our own work, we refuse to value work from anyone if it doesn\u2019t come packaged in a bracing blue and socially praised bow.

We are allowed the whim of our inclinations when it comes to supporting \u2018work\u2019 because support is indicative of character, not necessity. We are allowed the whim of popularity when it comes to supporting \u2018work\u2019 because trends are fun, but definitely, most absolutely assuredly, not moral. We are allowed the whim of merit when it comes to where our hard-earned dollars go, because privilege only factors for things not earned and we have all, in every possible way, earned our dollars.

It\u2019s just too risky, even as it saves us. It\u2019s just too unlikely, too un-measurable, too damn vulnerable, to be anything we\u2019d invest in permanently.
