{"parent": "", "name": "2091", "content": "Meaning in the Mundane {23}:\u00a0Belief. First off, let me say that I value this community. Medium has been a place where I\u2019ve found support when I\u2019ve doubted, encouragement when I\u2019ve faltered, and inspiration when there was none elsewhere. It is a special place, and I\u2019ve met some exceptional people here\u200a\u2014\u200aboth in spirit and in talent. This being said, I have to say something. It might make me unpopular, and might well open me up to criticism. So be it. I care too much about this community to not address what\u2019s been happening. I\u2019ve now been privy to two circumstances where the authenticity of a writer was questioned. In both circumstances, what began as a \u201cfeeling\u201d that something was \u201coff\u201d about a narrative turned into private messages and a fairly overt ganging up on the individuals in question. It has, in both cases, led to blocking, division, and some very hurt feelings. Now, look. You have no idea who I am, if my name is real, if what I write about is fantasy or reality. I have, for the most part, the same information about you. This is the nature of social media\u200a\u2014\u200awe take what we\u2019re given and make of it what we will. There will be things we believe and things we don\u2019t believe, things that resonate and things that don\u2019t. We may question each other\u2019s truths, and may even discuss them privately among our closer Medium friends. (Or our poor, poor, non-writer partners and friends.) But launching what amounts to full-scale campaigns against other writers here is destructive to what makes Medium such a special place. Indicating your disbelief is your prerogative, I suppose, but isn\u2019t it much kinder to simply unfollow or not respond, or to not get involved with it at all? What does it say if we, as a writing-based community, act in such a way as to actively dissuade someone from writing, simply because their writing doesn\u2019t fit with our collective notion about what writing of a certain type should \u201cfeel like\u201d? And even, what does it say if we make this space unsafe for that kind of writing to exist? There are millions of experiences I haven\u2019t had, and I would be lying if I told you I could predict how I would react or recount any one of those millions of experiences. I might even know what I would be expected to sound like, but would my real response reflect that? And if I forced it to, would that make me more or less authentic? No one likes being lied to, and a sense of authenticity is absolutely what makes Medium work. We believe each other, and the threat of being \u201ctaken\u201d disrupts us all\u200a\u2014\u200ait calls into question our own authenticity, makes us question what and who we believe and why. But I\u2019ve been here for a few months, and both times this has happened it\u2019s circled around issues of sexual assault. Given the nature of these writings, I\u2019d rather risk being duped than contribute to a culture that already makes people prove their experiences to an incomprehensible degree. As it stands, my inbox has been inundated with responses to a piece of writing I did wherein literally hundreds of people talked about not being believed, about having to prove, about the different values placed on their lives versus others. And further, as has been pointed out by others, if someone felt compelled to lie about such experiences, perhaps they need support and help, if of a different sort? I understand not being able to actively support something that feels unauthentic, but I do feel that there is an important difference between \u201cnot supporting\u201d and \u201cactively inhibiting\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhether this is done intentionally or not.
