{"content": "Ringer Pictures Presents \u2018Moreyball\u2019 A shot-for-shot remake of \u2018Moneyball,\u2019 chronicling the Rockets\u2019 turnaround The Houston Rockets have been one of the stories of the season. General manager Daryl Morey\u2019s 3-and-Free style of play has become a winning reality. The Rockets have won 55 games, leading the NBA in 3-pointers and free throw attempts. James Harden is the focal point of the second-best offense in the league. But it wasn\u2019t always this problem-free in Houston. This time last year, the Rockets were finishing an agonizing\u00a0.500 season, their two stars were feuding, and they were looking for a new head coach, having fired their coach just 11 games into the campaign. It is a remarkable turnaround, and Moreyball is the story of that turnaround. It\u2019s a (more or less) shot-for-shot remake of Moneyball. We couldn\u2019t get Brad Pitt, but otherwise it\u2019s basically the same thing.
