Most notably, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, one of the most conservative federal appeals courts in the country, held that Texas\u2019 voter ID law violates the Voting Rights Act. Their opinion noted data indicating that \u201cBlacks were 1.78 times more likely than Whites, and Latinos 2.42 times more likely, to lack\u201d voter ID.\u201d Yet, despite the racist impact of voter ID and a federal law prohibiting such impacts, it is far from clear that the Supreme Court will enforce the Voting Rights Act when it hears a challenge to voter ID. Last year, a federal appeals court struck down North Carolina\u2019s omnibus voter suppression law, after finding that the law was intentionally designed to target black voters and to minimize its impact on whites. Yet all four conservative justices voted to reinstate this law before the 2016 election. If Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, is confirmed, he will likely be the fifth vote in favor of racial voter suppression.
