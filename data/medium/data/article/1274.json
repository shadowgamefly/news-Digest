{"name": "1274", "parent": "", "content": "Do You Have To Hit Rock Bottom to Rise Again Like a\u00a0Phoenix Recently I discovered how \u2018hitting rock bottom\u2019 has become a new procrastination technique. People want to make changes in their life, but can\u2019t be bothered to start because they\u2019re too comfortable in their current lifestyle. So someone actually mentioned, \u201cMaybe I need to hit rock bottom to change something about my life\u2026\u201d Look at Arianna Huffington. It took her collapsing from exhaustion to wake up and realize her life had to change. JK Rowling is another example of a writer whose life imploded before she focused on the most important work of her life. 1000 Awesome Things was a blog Neil Pasricha began after losing a friend to suicide and having his wife sit him down and tell him their relationship is not working. Now millennials are thinking, \u201cThis hitting rock bottom thing is cool. I\u2019m waiting for my moment.\u201d Image courtesy of\u00a0Unsplash Maybe it\u2019s motivated by JK Rowling\u2019s Harvard speech about how rock bottom became the solid foundation on which she rebuilt her life, stripping away all the inessentials, etc\u2026 But let\u2019s deconstruct it; what is it about hitting rock bottom that\u2019s making people want to go there before steering their lives in a different direction? That thinking is quite errant for a couple of obvious reasons; Just because you\u2019re not taking control over your life doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not in control of your life. Nobody\u2019s going to live your life for you, and you only get one shot, whether you take it or not. The stakes are higher when that carpet is pulled from under you, so you won\u2019t have the resources (financial/emotional/cognitive) to truly experiment, and you\u2019ll still be stuck. If you think you don\u2019t have time just log how many hours you spend complaining and watching TV. Your idea might be, if it\u2019s not broken why fix it? To be honest with you, it doesn\u2019t matter what you tell your parents/family\u2026deep down inside each and every one of you knows when you\u2019re not fine. You can feel it in your heart every morning when you\u2019re facing the idea of getting up and going to work. It doesn\u2019t matter what your CV says or how your life appears. When you\u2019re not fine\u200a\u2014\u200aand it\u2019s broken\u200a\u2014\u200ayou do know. You really don\u2019t need to hit rock bottom to start diverting your life to one filled with a certain level of fulfillment. All it takes is to switch off the TV, arm yourself with google, and start doing something. Don\u2019t be a phoenix and wait to hit rock bottom before rising again. Be an eagle and start soaring today! What\u2019s the simplest first step you can take today to make a difference in your life? Hit me up on twitter @ahechoes.
