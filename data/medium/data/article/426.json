YC\u2019s Sam Altman and Michael\u00a0Seibel Hi readers, this is Sandra. There are two views of Y Combinator\u2019s twice-annual demo days, the most recent of which took place this week. You can look out, at the audience of investors, who rolled up in their sharpest South Bay uniforms: Tesla parked in the lot, blue-and-white checked shirt tucked in, salt-and-pepper hair on the head. (Though hey, who\u2019s that exception over there\u2026 oh that\u2019s Chamillionaire.) From that perspective, the future of startups looks just about the same as ever. It\u2019s easy to assume that as long as the money people are cut from the same cloth, the ideas people will tend to look (and think) a lot like them. But if you shift your gaze towards the stage, at the founders pitching their startups, that outlook changes. This week, the entrepreneurs looked nothing like the past. The welcome surprise of YC\u2019s Winter 2017 batch was that its startups were deeply, unabashedly, beautifully international. There was BuyPower, or \u201cPaypal for Africa.\u201d WaystoCap pitched itself as \u201cthe Alibaba of Africa.\u201d Kudi.AI is building chatbots for payments in, wait for it, Africa. Slide the globe eastward one tick, and the Indian startup crop is equally abundant. DocTalk proposed a WhatsApp for Indian doctors and patients. Credy pedaled a peer-to-peer lending platform. Then there was Supr, pitching daily milk delivery in India. (Coming on the heels of two \u201cX is the Trojan horse for Y\u201d startups, Supr\u2019s CEO noted that \u201cmilk is our Trojan cow.\u201d) By my unofficial count, more than 40 percent of the startups in this class had international roots, including a coterie of companies from Latin America and Europe. With the premier incubator in the world banking its reputation on a global batch of companies, we\u2019re seeing a clear break from tradition. And it might signify something more dramatic still, that the top tech institutions are becoming more inclusive. Silicon Valley is still home to the kingmakers, but the tycoons-to-be are starting to look a whole lot more cosmopolitan. Such changes don\u2019t happen overnight. For YC, it\u2019s been a slow build, beginning with the few emerging market startups accepted into earlier batches. Those companies proselytized to their friends back home, spreading the word to other ambitious entrepreneurs and strengthening YC\u2019s brand abroad. And last fall, two YC partners, Qasar Younis and Michael Seibel, embarked on a global tour to drum up applications, including a several-day stop in Nigeria. The result was a strong uptick in interest from Nigerian startups, among others, and a total class of 261 founders that drew from 22 countries. I wasn\u2019t the only one to notice the shift\u200a\u2014\u200aYC partners took to the stage on two occasions to reassure investors that the bulk of these international startups were now based in the US. Over coffee breaks, the conversation frequently turned to geography. But there was another notable change that I didn\u2019t see remarked upon. More than a third of the CEOs presenting on stage were women. Gone are the days when women only seemed to gain traction with women-themed companies, like dating or shopping. This week\u2019s female hotshots were more likely to be pitching hardware, AI, and financial startups. Just like that, female founders have started to become boring. So I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Y Combinator for demonstrating superb leadership. The only way to make technology reflect society is to start early, with companies still in the sapling stage. YC is uniquely poised to nudge Silicon Valley in the right direction, and with this latest class of graduates, it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s more than pulling its weight. \u2014 Sandra At Backchannel, We\u2019re All About Outsiders: YC isn\u2019t the only one going big on developing countries. Last fall Steven Levy wrote about Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s adventures in Nigeria. This week I dug into how Google is pegging its global ambitions to emerging market startups. It\u2019s a very smart plan framed around the idea of seeding the next dozen Silicon Valleys. My article highlights a Vietnamese founder whose AI app is helping English learners improve their accents. There\u2019s another side to that: helping voice platforms like Siri and Alexa get smarter about non-standard accents. In this piece, Sonia Paul dives into the frontiers of speech recognition research to figure out why, exactly, Alexa can\u2019t understand her mom. Reporting from the Philippines, Meredith Talusan recounts a surprising tale of how local women used a fleet of social media tools to flip the dating script with Western men. Read \u201cHow the Internet Gave Mail-Order Brides the Power\u201d to learn how Filipinas ended up in charge. Gender politics are never simple, though. Look no further than Stella and Dot, a startup valued by Sequoia at $370 million that lures accomplished women into selling jewelry to their friends. You can call it a female-centric side of the gig economy\u2026 or a social media spin on the door-to-door vacuum salesman. Alexis Sobel Fitts asks: Which one is it?
