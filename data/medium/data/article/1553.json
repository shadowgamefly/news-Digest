WASHINGTON, D.C.\u200a\u2014\u200aPresident Trump will never come up with real evidence to support his claim that three to five million ballots were cast illegally in the 2016 election. The allegation is false, and no number of investigations or committees will be able to substantiate Trump\u2019s claim. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the lie won\u2019t have consequences. Already, at least 21 states across the country are capitalizing on political rhetoric about fraud to push for laws that make it harder for eligible citizens to vote. At the annual gathering of secretaries of state in Washington, D.C. this week, Republican elections chiefs blocked an attempt to official denounce Trump\u2019s lie. Instead, they cited the president\u2019s claims, telling ThinkProgress they support measures like voter ID laws, cuts to same-day registration, and efforts to make it harder to register to vote. Alabama\u2019s Republican Secretary of State repeated the White House\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that thousands of out-of-state citizens cast ballots in New Hampshire, potentially handing the state to Hillary Clinton. New Hampshire\u2019s Secretary of State defended his state\u2019s voter accessibility while his legislature pushes for a measure that would potentially block thousands of college students from casting ballots. And Nevada\u2019s Secretary of State said she supports voter ID laws because she has never had a problem showing an ID to vote. Trump\u2019s lie about illegal votes will have dangerous consequencesSixteen states are already working on legislation to suppress voters this year.thinkprogress.org Study after study has shown that voter fraud is non-existent, yet the Republican party has used the false narrative of rampant fraud to push for laws that have shown to disenfranchise minority, low-income, and younger voters. Voter suppression laws do not prevent voter fraud, but they do prevent a disproportionately large share of Democratic-leaning voters from casting ballots, helping Republicans to win elections. Democratic secretaries of state, though fewer in number, were also at the gathering, where they told ThinkProgress that their work countering the \u201cvoter fraud\u201d narrative has become more challenging with President Trump in the White House. Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill (D) said she worries for the future of voting laws with Republicans controlling all three branches of government. And New Mexico\u2019s Maggie Toulouse Oliver (D) said that all state election chiefs should know that Trump\u2019s claims of massive fraud are false, given the small number of fraud cases each state has documented. \u201cThis group knows better and is potentially poised to be very vocal about that,\u201d she told ThinkProgress. \u201cI would be dismayed to hear that those false claims are being used to make things harder for voters.\u201d Looking for proof of fraud, GOP grasps at\u00a0straws Voting experts have repeated since the election that there is no proof of fraud on the level that Trump has claimed. At the National Association of Secretaries of State convention, David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, reminded the attendees that if massive fraud had occurred, they would be the first to know. \u201cThere is a system of checks and balances in place,\u201d he said during a panel on trust in elections. \u201cWe all know in this room that if there were massive voter registration fraud, we would have seen large numbers of flagged records that didn\u2019t match DMV records or social security records, that we would have seen unusual levels of activity we hadn\u2019t seen before, that we would have seen large numbers of requests for out of state mail ballots that we hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d None of that occurred, but that hasn\u2019t stopped elections chiefs from crying fraud. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said that he has identified 304 potential cases of voter fraud in his state since he took office in 2015, and a far smaller number ended with convictions. Though that number pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s claim of millions, Merrill said he can never be sure that other states don\u2019t have more rampant fraud. \u201cI\u2019ve had some information that\u2019s been introduced to me that\u2019s been very disconcerting,\u201d he told ThinkProgress. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very concerned that there are instances in other states that may have a higher level of credibility than had been widely known before now.\u201d Alabama Republican Secretary of State John Merrill. CREDIT: AP Photo/Brynn Anderson The instance Merrill was referring to was a claim that roughly 6,000 people registered to vote on Election Day in New Hampshire using out-of-state ID cards. Though it\u2019s currently legal to same-day register and to use a different state\u2019s ID, Merrill claimed that it could be evidence of massive vote fraud. \u201cSome people would look at that as fraudulent activity because in their state law, it only indicates that you have to have intent to live there,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, their intent could be that I show up and then I go back to my home [state].\u201d The White House has also pointed to vote fraud in New Hampshire, without any evidence. Senior policy adviser Stephen Miller was unable to substantiate his claim that out-of-state voters were bused into New Hampshire to commit fraud; neither could Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), a Trump ally, who told CNN the same lie. \u201cStatements that come from the White House are usually based on data or evidence or facts, and that\u2019s clearly not the environment we\u2019re living in right now,\u201d California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) told ThinkProgress. For his part, New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D) has said he will not buy the claims without proof, but told ThinkProgress he welcomes investigators in his state to determine whether the small number of fraudulent votes he has seen could mean there are many more that go unreported. \u201cPeople say that if you get picked up for a DWI, you\u2019ve probably done it at least ten times, maybe more,\u201d he told ThinkProgress. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to quantify it\u2026 We have many races that are decided by less than five votes.\u201d 2017 could be a banner year for voter ID\u00a0laws Already this year, at least 12 states are pushing for restrictive voter ID laws. In Arkansas and North Dakota, bills have already passed in their state houses, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. While most proposals have come out of the legislatures, Iowa\u2019s Secretary of State himself proposed a plan to implement voter ID. Alabama already has a strict voter ID law, and Secretary of State Merrill said he recommends all of his colleagues push for similar requirements in their states. \u201cI think everybody needs to have it because everybody needs to be interested in preserving the credibility and integrity of the election system,\u201d he said. When presented with recent studies that document how voter ID blocks certain populations from voting, Merrill responded: \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to say that. It\u2019s easy for people to say it\u2019s a restrictive mechanism or it limits participation.\u201d Not all state legislatures considering voter ID laws have the support of their elections chiefs. Legislators in Maine this week considered a voter ID bill, but Secretary of State Matt Dunlap (D) told ThinkProgress he has always opposed it. \u201cIt adds no additional security, it adds an unknown cost and we don\u2019t know how it would be paid for, and it would put a barrier between voters and the polling places,\u201d he said. \u201cI see this as a cynical approach to keep low-income people, people under financial stress, minorities, the elderly from participating in their democratic form of self governance.\u201d Other efforts to curb voter participation In addition to voter ID laws, elections officials are pushing for other, sometimes more subtle ways, to block people from the polls. Both Iowa and New Hampshire\u200a\u2014\u200astates with crucial early presidential primaries\u200a\u2014\u200aare considering eliminating same day registration. Texas is considering shortening the early voting period. And New Hampshire is also floating a residency requirement that would make it much more difficult for out-of-state students, military personnel, and other temporary residents to cast a ballot. That bill, predicated on false claims that thousands of out-of-state voters came into New Hampshire to sway the election, would change the law from requiring voters to simply be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in the state to vote to requiring them to be in New Hampshire for 210 days a year. At the same time, the state is considering requiring voters to be residents who plan to live in New Hampshire \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d Gardner, New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state, seemed unaware of the proposals when ThinkProgress asked him for comment. Democrats take the opposite\u00a0approach Meanwhile, among most Democratic elections chiefs in Washington for the convention, the consensus was that states should implement automatic registration, expand early voting, and make registration easier to encourage more people to participate in election. According to the Brennan Center, already these year, \u201c99 bills that would modernize voter registration have been introduced in 29 states, with automatic voter registration being the most prevalent.\u201d Bills to introduce automatic registration have been introduced in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Alabama\u2019s Merrill\u200a\u2014\u200awho has said automatic registration would \u201ccheapen\u201d civil rights leaders\u2019 work\u2014 questioned why any state would not \u201callow a person to decide what they want to do.\u201d But a number of Democratic elections officials said there\u2019s no reason not to make registration automatic. \u201cWe know that in New Mexico the allegations that are being made by the administration don\u2019t bear out,\u201d Toulouse Oliver said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep moving forward to try to expand the franchise.\u201d Denise Merrill of Connecticut agreed, saying she has collected data to prove the integrity of the voting process. Out of the millions of votes cast, a commission has only found 16 cases of potential fraud, most of which were mistakes or clerical errors. \u201cWe have fought off any effort to claim that there\u2019s voter fraud,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately I think it\u2019s far too easy today to get people to think there\u2019s a conspiracy, and so just bringing this up is a problem. It erodes trust in democracy, and that\u2019s the worst of it.\u201d ", "title": "Citing Trump\u2019s voter fraud lie, states are working to make it harder to\u00a0vote", "sentences": [{"0ebc": "Citing Trump\u2019s voter fraud lie, states are working to make it harder to\u00a0vote"}, {"771d": "Secretaries of state say legislation like voter ID laws are necessary."}, {"84be": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u200a\u2014\u200aPresident Trump will never come up with real evidence to support his claim that three to five million ballots were cast illegally in the 2016 election.
