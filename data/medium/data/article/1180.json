Yes, I have a 3 step method you can do in 3 minutes that will change your life (or at the very least the next 10 minutes). I have to forewarn you, it\u2019s not a productivity hack. It\u2019s not a goal-setting method. It has absolutely nothing to do with Bulletproof coffee. It\u2019s the art of resetting. Here\u2019s how it goes: Step 1: Pause for 1\u00a0minute Pause. Drop what ever you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t think. Don\u2019t act. Pause. The purpose is to settle down and break away from the hustle, anxiety, or overwhelming feelings you currently face. And just pause, for 1 minute. Step 2: Reflect on something good for 1\u00a0minute Reflect. Reflect on something good that\u2019s happened to you today. Reflect on friends or family. Reflect on how far you\u2019ve come in life. Reflect on the beauty in front of you. Force your brain to turn it\u2019s cognitive powers onto the good things in your life (because we\u2019re hardwired for the exact opposite). The purpose here is to shift your mindset to seek good. This plays an important roll in the next step. Reflect on the good, for 1 minute. Step 3: Focus entirely on your ONE thing for 1\u00a0minute Focus. Life is a process, a series of actions. Once this minute is up, there will be something you\u2019ll need to do. Not two things. Not four. One. Whether it\u2019s spending quality time with a spouse, or writing an email, or painting, there has to be one thing facing you at the end of this timer. Therefore, focus all your attention on how you will do that one thing, well. Focus on the feeling of achieving your one thing. Focus on the good it will bring. Focus on being the best lover/writer/painter for the next ___ minutes. Then get to work. Repeat this as many times as you need for a lifetime. The art of resetting will change you. Hey there I\u2019m Declan! I\u2019m going through a major life transition right now and would be stoked if you tagged along. And yes, there is free stuff waiting for you on the other side of this button: ", "title": "3 Things You Can Do in the Next 3 Minutes that Will Benefit You for a\u00a0Lifetime", "sentences": [{"45e0": "3 Things You Can Do in the Next 3 Minutes that Will Benefit You for a\u00a0Lifetime"}, {"b927": "It\u2019s so simple you\u2019ll hate me for even writing this post."}, {"db67": "Yes, I have a 3 step method you can do in 3 minutes that will change your life (or at the very least the next 10 minutes)."}, {"5442": "I have to forewarn you, it\u2019s not a productivity hack.
