{"name": "1245", "parent": "", "content": "Okay It\u2019s going to be okay,\u00a0Because as of today,You will no longer play,Games that lead you astray. Open your eyes and see,Feel the breeze,\u00a0As it sets you free,From your delusion spree. The day is done,Soon tomorrow will be gone,You will be the star that shone,As you pass every milestone. Experience right now,And go with the flowBefore the bow,Strikes you with big blow, Memories subside,Nothing sticks by your side.\u00a0As you try to escape the tide,Keep up the stride. Words can be so cold,Despite them being bold,When the feeling is sold,To time that couldn\u2019t be controlled. Maybe you won\u2019t forget,But you\u2019ll look back with no regret,With nothing to fret,Until your very last breath. It\u2019s going to be okay.This is just delay,Call it foray,Which will be gone one day. This is not the end,Just a minor bend,For you to fend,Before you make amends. Everything shapes up,In ways you least expect them to,And when they do,The bigger picture is right in front of you. When you feel they are slipping away,When you feel you are being replaced,To a point where it cannot be chased,Know that it\u2019s going to be okay. At some point you will find,That you let it all go,With an open mind,As you embrace what\u2019s written for you. People don\u2019t stick around,Neither does sorrow or pain,In this life we\u2019re in,Time is seldom abound. When no one\u2019s around,When everyone\u2019s gone,You have to be strong,Because you\u2019ve got it in you. No need for rocks,No need for shields,Just the need to realize,That you can be all those things. At the end of it all,You must stand tall,As you recall,Every fall. You will walk down that road,With nothing but the Stars,To remind you of the day,You realized it was going to be okay.
