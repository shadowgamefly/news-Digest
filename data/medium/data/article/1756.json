{"name": "1756", "parent": "", "content": "If a Jay Z Song Streams and Nobody Hears It, Does It Make a\u00a0Sound? Artists risk seeing their cultural resonance fade when they abandon the major streaming platforms A couple of weeks ago, a friend and I were discussing the albums we keep in constant rotation. A constant-rotation album is obviously a personal favorite, but over time it also becomes a life companion. It offers reassurance across cities, jobs, relationships, and distribution formats. I might habitually return to an album because it\u2019s dense enough to contain an endless number of sonic mysteries (ATLiens), versatile enough to serve up a new form of human genius every two minutes (Innervisions), or familiar enough that every periodic spin feels like a catch-up phone call with an old friend (The College Dropout). I listen to these albums because I enjoy them but also to establish a self-continuity that connects my past and present. I keep coming back to them because I have always kept coming back to them. My friend mentioned Jay Z\u2019s The Blueprint, which is a great album to keep in constant rotation for a few reasons. There\u2019s the lush, soulful production that makes it feel timeless rather than dated, and there\u2019s the fact that most Jay Z lyrics are easy to recite but also nuanced and clever, so his effortless cool can be transferred to the listener for at least a few bars. But I actually haven\u2019t listened to The Blueprint in more than a year, I realized, not since Jay Z removed the album from Spotify and Apple Music in early 2016 (along with The Blueprint 2, which Jay can keep to himself). Now the rapper appears to be going further with his digital scrubbing. All of his solo albums, as well as Watch the Throne, disappeared from Spotify and Apple Music last week. Most have since been restored to Apple Music but remain absent from Spotify. The only streaming platform with access to Jay Z\u2019s entire discography is his own, Tidal. Obviously, Jay Z does not need Spotify in order to remain relevant. He has sold millions of records, played the silent villain in the biggest musical release of 2016, and continues to dutifully drop dusty feature verses in 2017. Like many of the artists who choose to trade ubiquity for long-term exclusivity\u200a\u2014\u200aranging from Beyonc\u00e9 to Taylor Swift to Garth Brooks\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019s bigger than any one platform. But I managed to carve Jay Z out of my life without even really thinking about it, just because his best songs weren\u2019t available at my fingertips. With the gaps in streaming catalogs now seemingly a permanent way of life in music consumption, I\u2019m beginning to wonder how many other music fans have simply cut Jay Z, or other hard-to-access artists, out of their listening habits. Today\u2019s crop of college students probably don\u2019t remember the day Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001, an abrupt and tragic end to an ascendant career. She had released her first Billboard no. 1 single, \u201cTry Again,\u201d the year before, and her third solo LP, Aaliyah, just a month before her death. She has lived on as a ghost floating into the modern R&B soundscape she helped pioneer\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cRock the Boat\u201d was sampled on the Weeknd\u2019s breakout mixtape, House of Balloons, and Drake once harbored a public Aaliyah obsession that he has thankfully suppressed in recent years. But by and large, her music has drifted slowly away from collective cultural memory, mainly because it\u2019s unavailable on streaming or digital-download platforms. The exact reasons we can\u2019t stream Aaliyah are murky\u200a\u2014\u200aher reclusive uncle and his defunct record label own the masters to her most famous work\u200a\u2014\u200abut the end result for the streaming user is that one of the biggest R&B stars of the turn of the century has effectively been wiped off the face of the digital planet (at least we have the \u201cAre You That Somebody\u201d music video). Aaliyah remains an internet talking point, but a lot of the discussion centers on her style rather than her actual music. She\u2019s become a symbol partially due to her sudden death but also because her music lockdown forces us to engage with her through images and memory alone. Aaliyah is an extreme example, but more and more we\u2019re finding that the unwillingness of some artists (or their managers) to allow their music to proliferate online butts up against our modern notion that media should be easy to access at all times. The eulogizing of Prince last year on social media was made difficult because he fastidiously kept his music off the digital platforms where people congregate. Kanye West created a spectacle and a pretty good meme around the Tidal-exclusive The Life of Pablo, but none of the tracks ultimately achieved the ubiquity of his previous work. Meanwhile, Drake has been flooding every crevice of the internet with pop hits for what feels like a decade now. After a short stint as an Apple exclusive, 2016\u2019s Views arrived on all the major streaming platforms and has sold the equivalent of 2 million albums from digital spins alone. This year\u2019s More Life got a wide release from the start and is already breaking Views\u2019 records. If Jay Z is trying to wield power by turning Tidal into an exclusive, prestigious club, Drake\u2019s power comes through his omnipresence. Every online club is a Drake club. His strategy better aligns with how we consume music and value artists today. \u201cArtists should think about streaming the same way they think about mainstream radio,\u201d says Catherine Moore, professor of music and technology at the University of Toronto. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a major artist ever saying I don\u2019t want my music on [New York City radio station] Z100 because they don\u2019t pay record labels.\u201d As streaming has grown into the primary mode of music consumption in the United States, it\u2019s grown more radiolike. Spotify now places a huge emphasis on playlists, to the point that it\u2019s launched an ad campaign around its biggest ones. Apple Music uses its live radio show to premiere new songs the same way terrestrial stations do. Pandora now has its own Spotify-killer, but has been touting \u201clean back\u201d features that serve users songs they want to hear rather than forcing them to thumb through LPs. These platforms are trying to teach consumers to use them not just to access songs from a digital locker but also to experience the current cultural musical moment\u200a\u2014\u200aand what artist doesn\u2019t want to be part of that? The rub is that even if streaming is replacing radio, it\u2019s also eating away at album and single sales at the same time without offering artists the same amount of compensation. That\u2019s why Taylor Swift ditched Spotify and why Adele waited months to put 25 on streaming services. From a financial standpoint, Jay\u2019s moves make sense. He\u2019s probably earning a pittance from his back catalog on streaming services, and shoring up the catalog of Tidal could help him attract even more investors. Sprint recently bought a 33 percent stake in the company, effectively dashing any dreams that the streaming wars for exclusive content will end anytime soon. It\u2019s just business, Jay Z has rapped in various cool/effortless ways over the years (quick paraphrase: \u201cI left my Spotify audience to double my dollars / they criticize me for it yet they all yell \u2018holla\u2019\u201d). But a lack of loyalty between fans and artists can go both ways. Artists face a financial risk in letting their music propagate online, but they face a cultural risk by assuming that fans will jump through hoops to reach them. \u201cPeople want instant gratification,\u201d says Moore. \u201cIf they\u2019re signed up on a streaming service and they can\u2019t find [a song], it\u2019s hard to motivate them to join another music service.
