Leida sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s worried about me, thanks to your hostile reaction earlier, which he perceived to be mine.\u201d When Roy\u2019s shock on seeing Tamra\u2019s bloody corpse had worn off, he\u2019d insisted they leave right away before someone came along and blamed them for her death. In his urgency, he\u2019d reached for Leida\u2019s hand, but Tamra had recoiled from his touch. He\u2019d been watching Leida like a hawk since. \u201cBut why don\u2019t you want him to know what\u2019s going on? He\u2019s your brother.\u201d \u201cPrecisely. And I\u2019ve troubled him enough these past few months. I want to first find out how and why this happened, and how to undo it.\u201d Dusk had fallen by the time they reached the stone house adjacent to the infamous Chalice tavern on Trident Way. After Roy left his cart in a neighbor's barn, they ascended the short steps into their home. Tamra hovered while he lit a dozen fat candles seated on sconces. Through the soft candlelight, she surveyed the modest hall which doubled as a kitchen. Her gaze fell first on the cupboard standing in a dim corner, its shelves packed with crockery and utensils. It looked like a daunting figure lurking in the shadows. She followed a whiff of rosemary and lavender, and found the herbs on a long table with a bench on either side of it. Tamra jerked when a draught rattled the pitchers and ladles hanging on the bare walls. \u201cYou\u2019re giving yourself away,\u201d Leida whispered. Roy was leaning against the wall, watching her. Behind him, a crackling fire blew smoke up the chimney. \u201cExcuse yourself and head for my bedchamber.\u201d Tamra pretended to yawn. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit tired. I think I\u2019ll go lie down for a while.\u201d He nodded. \u201cGo ahead, I\u2019ll start supper.\u201d She felt his eyes bore into her back when she turned on her heel, his ears deaf to his sister\u2019s voice guiding her along the narrow hallway and into a dark chamber. With Leida\u2019s instructions, she lit the room\u2019s candles. Their flickering light showed her a foreign reflection in the mirror\u00a0facing\u00a0the east\u00a0wall. She sat in front of the dressing table and peered into the glass. A dusky maiden stared back. Tamra watched her fingers trace smooth skin the colour of black walnut, and thick eyebrows that arched to the heavens. Dark brown eyes, just like Roy\u2019s, blinked when she did. And beneath a flat nose that gently flared at the nostrils, her lips were fuller. She slid off the caul to reveal tightly twisted braids\u200a\u2014\u200aalso just like Roy\u2019s but longer\u200a\u2014\u200aheld back with a hairpin. She rose and took a step back to better assess her now slim, curvy physique. She patted her chest, and despite the heavy layers of clothing, she could tell the new bosom was more generous than her original flat one. Tamra grinned. She was spectacular. \u201cI\u2019m well aware but thank you,\u201d Leida said. \u201cNow if you\u2019ve finished groping me, I\u2019d like to know why you killed yourself.\u201d Tamra sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, one I wouldn\u2019t have minded sharing if I wasn\u2019t so tired, famished and,\u201d she eyed the washstand in the corner, \u201cprobably in need of a bath.\u201d Leida snorted. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not sharing any more of my body with you.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd what if our union is permanent? You\u2019ll never bathe again?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you know after we visit the oracle of Themis tomorrow.\u201d Tamra groaned. \u201cOracles,\u201d she spat. \u201cI don\u2019t know which of their attributes I loathe more. Their superior airs or their cryptic insights.\u201d Leida smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not fond of them either, but an oracle is our best chance at finding out how this happened.\u201d \u201cWhat will you tell your brother?\u201d \u201cNothing. Roy\u2019s a porter. He\u2019ll leave for the market at first light.\u201d Tamra rushed to the bed when a knock sounded on the door. Roy entered bearing a tray; the food\u2019s aroma crept up her nose, and her stomach growled in response. He placed the tray on one of the massive oak chests beside the bed. Steaming pottage rich with meat, vegetables and bread nearly had her drivelling. She looked at Roy. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her left hand was reaching for the cup on the tray when Leida snarled at her to use her right. She took a sip and wrinkled her face at the taste of ale. Roy frowned. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d Leida said. \u201cYou loathe ale just as much as oracles.\u201d \u201cNo, I tolerate ale\u00a0better than\u00a0oracles. But mead is my preferred\u00a0choice\u00a0of\u00a0alcohol.\u201d \u201cWell, I love ale and so should you if you don\u2019t want to rouse his suspicions any further.\u201d Tamra took another sip and beamed at Roy. \u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Although he smiled back, she thought she detected a certain cynicism behind it. \u201cI\u2019ll go bolt the doors,\u201d he said. \u201cRest well, sister.\u201d When the door shut behind him, Tamra attacked the meal like it was her last. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d she bit into the bread, \u201cdying and coming back to life in someone else\u2019s body is very hungry work.\u201d After she cleared the last morsel from the bowl, she downed the rest of the ale and set the dishes aside. She kicked off her shoes and reclined on the bed, a purr escaping her lips as a cool breeze caressed her cheek. The candles burned brighter, refusing to cower before the wind. \u201cOn our way here,\u201d Tamra began, \u201cwhen you said you tried to stop me from jumping, I thought I heard a measure of guilt in your voice. Can I ask why?\u201d It was a while before Leida answered. \u201cBecause three years ago, after an unspeakable family tragedy that changed mine and Roy\u2019s lives forever, I stood in your shoes on the edge of a lofty cliff. And if I hadn\u2019t found the will to save myself, I would have been a heap of broken bones too.\u201d \u201cHow did you find the will?\u201d \u201cWhen I slipped on the stones and found myself dangling over the edge, I knew in my soul that I wanted to live, that I needed to live. I also thought of Roy and what my death would have done to him. So I pulled myself up and vowed to the gods that I would never again try to take my own life.\u201d They lay in silence, listening to each other ponder the outcome of their impending visit to the oracle, each for her own reasons. Tamra let the noises outside lull her; she was drifting off when a cool blade pressed against her throat. Her eyes shot open, all traces of sleep gone. Roy loomed over her, his teeth bared. \u201cI don\u2019t know what manner of sorcery you used to disguise yourself as Leida, but I know as sure as the gods that you\u2019re not her.\u201d He pressed the blade harder. \u201cSo who are you?
