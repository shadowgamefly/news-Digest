The platform has partnered with its critics\u200a\u2014\u200awhich may make it harder to know if its brain trust\u2019s efforts are effective Last week, Facebook users in 14 countries opened their News Feeds to find a cute illustration of a magnifying glass over a newspaper, along with a tagline advertising \u201cTips for spotting false news.\u201d If they chose to click through\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s a big if\u200a\u2014\u200athey landed at the platform\u2019s historically unsexy Help Center, where the digital media literacy group First Draft had provided 10 bullet points of plain-text advice. Among them were suggestions to \u201cbe skeptical,\u201d \u201cinvestigate the source,\u201d and \u201clook at other reports\u201d when reading the news on Facebook. All of it was helpful common sense, but also tragically boring. It was as if the same tech platform that, for years, has been inventing features like autoplay video, livecasting, and colorful blocky text to improve engagement was suddenly bitter about completing an obligatory homework assignment, and wanted to make its users suffer for it, too. To give Facebook credit, this wasn\u2019t the first or only thing it had done to show us its measured concern with the spread of fake news. Since CEO Mark Zuckerberg flippantly described the notion of Facebook influencing the outcome of the U.S. election as \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d last year, the company has come a long way in demonstrating a commitment to eliminating misleading content in its ecosystem. In January, the company brought on former TV journalist Campbell Brown to form partnerships with the media. It also introduced the Facebook Journalism Project, an initiative that promised to develop new news products, train the public to be more news literate, and create what turned out to be problematic educational tools for journalists. Most notably, in late March it created a partnership with independent fact-checking organizations to flag what it dubbed \u201cdisputed\u201d stories. (Though the head of Facebook\u2019s News Feed only recently hinted at making that model more sustainable by being \u201copen to\u201d paying those fact-checkers itself.) Earlier this month the company became a founding (and funding) father of a news-literacy initiative that will run independently out of City University of New York\u2019s journalism graduate school. Practically any organization that was in the position to critique Facebook\u2019s news-delivery model now seems to be partnering with the company in some capacity. When it comes to making continual announcements about its progress in the area of halting fake news, Facebook is killing it. And, in theory, having these experts aiding its efforts behind the scenes should be helpful. But amid all these partnerships and experiments, a fog has emerged as to what, if any, effect Facebook\u2019s efforts are having on its users. For every headline we\u2019ve read about a new initiative to combat fake news, the measurement tools and statistics to follow up on their success have been absent. First Draft\u2019s tips to avoid spreading false information were harmless, but how many people even clicked through that link atop their News Feed to reach them? If they clicked, how many seconds did they spend on that imageless, videoless, colorless Help Center page? Now that the campaign has ended, why is it so difficult to manually search for those tips on the platform? Facebook might have this information, but it hasn\u2019t shared it with the public at large. So we have no way of knowing whether these campaigns are simply paying lip service to an issue or actively improving it. Tailoring the presentation of a website\u2019s content based on engaging users is practically baked into the structure of a company as large as Facebook. As Seth Ashley, a communications associate professor at Boise State University, notes, it would only be natural to apply that same strategy to the platform\u2019s news literacy campaigns. \u201cI\u2019m all for them doing A-B, product testing,\u201d he said. \u201cA company that big is definitely trying to make sure it knows its market and is reaching it correctly. Even for literacy stuff, what works on one market might not work on a different one. What works for my students might be very different from what works for my mom on Facebook.\u201d The public may not necessarily be privy to the impact of each campaign to combat fake news, but there is hope that more engaging educational content is on the horizon. The News Literacy Project, which will release its own campaign on the platform in a couple weeks, has promised its presentation will include \u201cvideos and other multimedia elements familiar to Facebook users.\u201d Though the organization has declined to comment on whether they will be specifically tailored to certain demographics of Facebook\u2019s 18-billion-user community, its PSA will at least be more eye-catching than what we\u2019ve seen so far. In order for Facebook to really follow through on its promise to educate users, however, its partners need to leverage the platform\u2019s most popular tools. Facebook\u2019s Sabrina Kizzie, an adjunct lecturer in social media at Baruch College, suggests using Facebook Live to broadcast live Q&As with experts or\u200a\u2014\u200ain the spirit of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200aintroduce the team of experts and engineers Facebook has tasked to address the issue. \u201cYou want to provide this information, but you have to consider every chance to make it easy for consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you really want to get a message across to consumers, the sense of urgency of starting a Live video in the News Feed will get to them right away. Use the platform.\u201d Why Facebook hasn\u2019t used the very tools it promotes to the masses for its news-literary efforts is unclear. Zuckerberg has been historically cagey about his company taking a stand for or against specific news sources to avoid seeming partisan. Passing on this responsibility to a collection of nonprofits provides a layer of protection to the company. Maybe it\u2019s too risky to assign an individual expert to a Live video Q&A, on the off chance that they might\u200a\u2014\u200aoh, I dunno\u200a\u2014\u200acriticize a site like Breitbart or discuss the inherent sociological effects that Facebook\u2019s interface has on its users. As Ashley points out, some of the problems in news literacy that he teaches to his students are problems created by Facebook itself. \u201cFacebook is a business and they want to keep people on their website,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not likely to do much that runs counter to those goals.\u201d ", "title": "How Will We Know If Facebook\u2019s Fight Against Fake News Is\u00a0Working?", "sentences": [{"37cd": "How Will We Know If Facebook\u2019s Fight Against Fake News Is\u00a0Working?"}, {"8339": "The platform has partnered with its critics\u200a\u2014\u200awhich may make it harder to know if its brain trust\u2019s efforts are effective"}, {"fd6b": "Last week, Facebook users in 14 countries opened their News Feeds to find a cute illustration of a magnifying glass over a newspaper, along with a tagline advertising \u201cTips for spotting false news.\u201d If they chose to click through\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s a big if\u200a\u2014\u200athey landed at the platform\u2019s historically unsexy Help Center, where the digital media literacy group First Draft had provided 10 bullet points of plain-text advice.
