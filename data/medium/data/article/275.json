{"name": "275", "parent": "", "content": "10 annoying issues in Sketch and 9 easy solutions for\u00a0them Get monthly cutting edge emails for designers: https://upscri.be/bb0afd/ I am a big Sketch fan since I moved from Adobe Photoshop. We designers love it, seriously! But\u00a0\u2026 sometimes this app is driving me nuts. So what is wrong there? List of\u00a0issues: And I solved 9 of 10 issues. I hope together in comments we will figure out what to do with the #7. Fixing the\u00a0issues 1. Half\u00a0pixels What is a magical trick on the GIF below? Look at the values on a right side. Solutions: Done. Go back to your project, select the top group and press a shortcut. This \u201cRound to Pixel\u201d will be applied to any object inside, except \u201cLines\u201d, although. It does not work for them. I recommend using \u201cRectangles\u201d instead. 2. With \u201cCommand + v\u201d Sketch inserts objects to a random position on the artboard. Solution: Use \u201cPaste Here\u201d option. It will arrange an object right there. 3. Sketch works slowly and drive is running out of\u00a0space. Screen with the\u00a0.sketch files which store on your hard\u00a0drive Solution: Here is an instruction how to solve it. I got 130gb free space on my MacBook, for instance! 4. Mess within an artboard\u00a0panel. We can follow the rules of the naming of groups but anyway it is completely impossible to find something while so many groups are open. Now your life is way easier. Press shortcut if you are lost somewhere between groups on the left\u00a0panel. Solution: Assign a new shortcut to fold/collapse it! 5. Selecting of objects is\u00a0painful. How many times should I click to select an object? Sometimes 6. Then deeper that layer in structure than more clicks it requires. Here I clicked only 1 time instead of 3. How?\u00a0Solution: Hold \u201cCommand\u201d key when you click on an object. That is it. 6. Lack of collaboration. We don\u2019t have any Sketch solution out from the box that just works. However, we have some good solutions from Craft and Picnic Plugins. Sharing sketch files with the colleagues is just bad. These guys are developing good solution\u200a\u2014\u200aauto syncing with sketch files in real time! Unfortunately, plugin is still under development. Waiting for a beta! Solution: Craft already has a solution to move discussions into good workspace. 7. Can not apply \u201cShared style\u201d to the layer\u2019s\u00a0group. Very often I need to apply new color for SVG icon wich stays somewhere in a deep into group or I want to apply the new Shared Style for each icon inside a group. In current condition, shared styles can not be applied to the layer\u2019s group. Very sad. On this icon is not blue, although should be like this due to applied style. It does not\u00a0work. Send a comment you know how to fix it, dear friend.\u00a0Not solved yet. 8. Zooming. How to find zooming range that I need? 100%, 50%, 25%\u200a\u2014\u200apoor choice. Solution: There is a shortcut for it, indeed. Hold a \u201cCommand\u201d key and use mouse scroll. It will zoom-in or zoom-out by 4% on an each step. 9. When I move several artboards with \u201cShift\u201d key on hold one artboard becomes unselected. The reason for using it\u200a\u2014\u200aeach time when you hold \u201cShift\u201d and move artboards by mouse they move only vertically or horizontally. It helps to move things in strong order. That \u201cBug\u201d is shown\u00a0here Solution: Select the artboards, click and hold on artboard name (like on a screenshot below), hold \u201cShift\u201d. Drag them around.\u00a0It works. 10. Sketch doesn\u2019t fill \u201cline-height\u201d value for text correctly. With each newly added text layer, you may notice that line height is not good for reading. We have to count each time a formula\u200a\u2014\u200atext size * 1.5 = good line-height. For example: 14px * 1.5 = 21px. Solution: There is a plugin for it, and it is awesome!Press Command + L to set the line-height ratio. The final\u00a0word Issue number #7 is not solved yet. Does somebody know that way to fix it?
