{"name": "1133", "parent": "", "content": "What to Do About Boys Who Wear\u00a0Dresses Illustration by Carly Jean\u00a0Andrews Darcy\u2019s 7-year-old son Francis wears a dress pretty much every day. \u201cIt makes him feel pretty,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe started really early, around 2 years old.\u201d Darcy bought gender-neutral toys to see what Francis gravitated toward, and says he was naturally drawn to trains and cars\u200a\u2014\u200abut also to the idea of being a girl. Sometimes he re-enacts dramatic scenes as movie characters, like Elsa from Frozen, or models twinkly jewelry sent by Darcy\u2019s mother. \u201cBut then he\u2019ll sit down and play with trains or build Legos all afternoon,\u201d Darcy explains. \u201cIt\u2019s fluid.\u201d Darcy, a psychologist, says she and her husband haven\u2019t really been concerned about it. \u201cThis is exploration; it\u2019s natural development.\u201d Jaclyn Lafer, a psychotherapist and early childhood specialist, agrees. \u201cBoys wear dresses because they feel good\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re soft, silky and fun to twirl. It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything. We adults apply the meaning to it.\u201d Lafer says there are benefits to allowing sons to wear feminine clothes because children naturally want to explore their world. \u201cThe more that we can let them come into themselves without applying shame to what they are doing, the better chance we\u2019re giving them to become human beings. Any time you say, \u2018That\u2019s not appropriate\u2019 or \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do that,\u2019 you\u2019re defining something for your child. But these aren\u2019t things we need to define for them.\u201d Of course, a lot of parents disagree. Jacob\u2019s New Dress, Book by Ian Hoffman and Sarah\u00a0Hoffman Last month Jacob\u2019s New Dress, a children\u2019s book about a boy wearing a dress meant to foster support and acceptance of gender-nonconforming children, was abruptly pulled from the reading list of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, one of the largest public school districts in North Carolina, after widespread outcry from parents. From the North Carolina Values Facebook page: Mabel Frank: I WILL take my children out of public school IF they dare to bring this book into their curriculum! AND I WILL SUE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM!!!! Kathy Auten Wrenn: I pray in the Name of Jesus Christ that this book is never introduced in any school system\u2026 anywhere. And that children never see it\u2026.read it\u2026 or hear of it. Amen James Mangum: If I had a son and he ever wore a dress the abuse would be to the seat of his pants. #not in my house \u201cWhat are they so worried about?\u201d asks Darcy, who says it\u2019s inaccurate to associate Francis\u2019s affinity for dresses with his future sexual orientation or gender identity. But is it? Studies have found that anywhere from 24 percent to 82 percent of gender-nonconforming kids may grow up to be gay or bisexual. Case in point: My friend Stephen, who is gay, says he used to sneak into his mom\u2019s closet when he was 8 years old to wear her dresses and high-heeled shoes. \u201cShe had some sequined dresses that made me feel glamorous! That could explain my fascination with beaded gowns today.\u201d On the flips side, other studies suggest the vast majority of boys who wear dresses stop doing so by puberty. My cousin\u2019s son Elliot is one of them. When he started wearing his sister\u2019s mermaid and fairy costumes, it was clear to his parents that he was drawn to the sparkles and the intricacy of the material itself. \u201cThe clothing didn\u2019t have a gender,\u201d his mom explains. \u201cIt was fun and colorful and allowed him to use his imagination in the same way that his box of crayons or sidewalk chalk did.\u201d Another friend\u2019s twin boys donned dresses and crowns for Halloween last year, telling their mom, \u201cPrincesses are cool so we want to be princesses.\u201d She shared on Facebook that she was proud to be raising feminist young men. Lafer stresses that children are naturally curious and says we shouldn\u2019t discourage that. \u201cI encourage parents to talk to their kids by asking questions. Instead of saying, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be wearing that dress,\u2019 why not ask, \u2018What is it you like about wearing that dress?\u2019 Go with their creativity. Encourage their thought and help them develop the person that they are and understand why they\u2019re drawn to things.\u201d As for Francis, Darcy says he\u2019s recently grown his hair long and enjoys putting it in pigtails. Sometimes, she says, if he\u2019s performing a scene, he\u2019ll add jewelry and accessories, but otherwise he just tries things out. \u201cHe went as Cinderella for for Halloween last year\u200a\u2014\u200awedding dress, veil and all. There were some kids who said some nasty things, but he wore it proudly.\u201d C. Brian Smith is a staff writer at MEL. He last wrote about an at-home sperm count test, via your smartphone.
