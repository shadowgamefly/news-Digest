Not in the design world. To be clear, this isn\u2019t an excuse to show 10 half-assed designs. This means, instead of showing one design you believe to be perfect, show 3 great ideas. The ampersand in the title of this section is important\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re trying to strike a balance and deliver on both. Time for a real-world example: Most projects start with a list of product requirements. The people who come up with the requirements usually have an idea of how they believe the product should look (whether they tell you or not). Quantity and quality comes into play when there are differing opinions about implementation. The best way to keep the project moving is to show at least two examples: Even if you know option 1 won\u2019t work in your head, showing the initial design is critical. Stakeholders won\u2019t be satisfied until they can actually see its shortcomings. Usually a mashup of the two concepts will be the final outcome, but that\u2019s better than executing a design you disagree with. Presentation is Everything You could have the world\u2019s best design, but if you don\u2019t know how to explain the problem being addressed and the reason for your design decisions, the design will never get approved. Context is king when it comes to pitching your idea or concept to others. There are two easy steps that will help you give a great presentation: If all you do is show your final design without providing context, people may not understand how you arrived at your conclusion and ask you to explore various other approaches. At that point, defending your work and pointing out the flaws in their suggestions might sound more defensive than you would like. Continual learning / Never be Satisfied This is something that is very important to me and a major part of being in a creative profession. I always make it a priority to learn new skills (software, leadership, dev languages, etc.)\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever I need to continue to grow as a designer. I don\u2019t buy the excuse that people are too busy to learn, because almost everyone has some free time at some point in the day. It comes down to what you do in that free time. If you become satisfied with your current abilities, you will soon become irrelevant as a designer. At my first job I learned how to write html, css and some basic js and became a \u201cdeveloper.\u201d When I took my second job I learned how to make illustrations and add animations to my designs. At my current job, I\u2019m learning how to communicate my thoughts more clearly and build prototypes to better demonstrate my designs. I never want to get to a point in my career or life, when I have the feeling that there is no more room for growth or learning. That\u2019s why I am constantly striving to develop new skills whenever I can. Steer Clear of\u00a0Trends Trendy words/designs/clothes, etc. are exactly that: trends. They will, without a doubt, die out and look dated (Remember skeumorphic design). I try to avoid incorporating short-lived trends whenever I can in life and in my career. Dress trendy and you have to buy a new wardrobe every season; Dress in classics and you can wear your clothes forever. Sometimes, you can get caught up trying to get more likes or favorites or whatever it may be, by following trends. I see tons of concepts with text or buttons overflowing past the background a random distance. Or I see a title that fits perfectly with the image designers chose but if any other image was used, the same layout would never work. Yet these shots have hundreds of likes\u2026 Disclaimer: I understand dribbble and other sites like it are meant to somewhat of a creative release for people. Therefore some of the work is strictly for fun and was never meant to be used in the real world. I\u2019m not saying trying new things and exploring new styles is bad\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s not practical. My suggestion is to not get sucked into this. If your design helps people use your product or understand what to do and only gets 5 likes, it\u2019s still a great design. On a semi-related note, I\u2019ve conducted a number of interviews lately and I\u2019ve picked up on many things throughout the process of trying to hire a fellow designer. Every time a candidate interviews with us and answers questions in buzzword after buzzword, the general consensus is they can\u2019t communicate their reasoning and thoughts very well for why they made certain design decisions.
