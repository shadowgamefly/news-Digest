{"name": "1013", "parent": "", "content": "Redesigning the Oscars Winner Card: a C.R.A.P.\u00a0Analysis If you\u2019re at all interested in the Oscars or are surrounded by people who are, by now you\u2019ve probably seen this: And I know what you\u2019re thinking: what a badly designed card! Here\u2019s one designer\u2019s articulation of why this card is ho-hum and what we can do to improve it. To get things started, the first thing we need to ask ourselves in any design problem is along the lines of\u2026 What problem are we\u00a0solving? In this case, the card holds the answer to a specific question: \u201cwhat is the winner of the Oscars Best Picture award?\u201d So the problem that we\u2019re trying to solve may be stated as: How might we provide the answer to <insert above question> clearly, quickly, confidently, and accurately. Cool. For the purposes of this exercise I\u2019m going to assume we\u2019re sticking to the paper medium. In other words, I am eliminating the use of apps, bots, or a good ol\u2019 game of telephone. Sorry, you creative kids. If you\u2019re a beginner designer, this book is highly accessible and enjoyable Ok, so, with the above problem statement and assumptions stated, I\u2019m going to dissect this visual design problem using a framework that you might find very useful. C.R.A.P. is a simple (and unfortunately named) framework that was, afaik, first articulated as such by Robin Williams (the designer, not the late actor). If you haven\u2019t yet, I would highly recommend checking out her book, The Non-Designer\u2019s Design Book. For the purposes of the rest of this post, I have recreated the card below and will do the remaining iterations on it. Roll up your pants and let\u2019s jump right in! C.R.A.P. Contrast \u201cContrast focuses our attention and should be used to highlight the most important points that the audience should take away.\u201d Now lets take a look at the card again: At quick glance, there are 3 distinct pieces that contrast against each other: the header, the body, and the footer. How this contrast is achieved is by using whitespace and styling, i.e. all three slices are spaced apart and they all have distinct typographic treatments. The problems start in the way these three parts of the card content are treated. Lets take it from the top: Iteration 1: Removing the Oscars\u00a0logo 2. The body contains the title of the Best Picture award winner, the names of the producers of the film, and their descriptor. And besides the double quotes around the film\u2019s name, the typographic treatment on the body is the same throughout. This lack of contrast makes the reader to take their time understanding what\u2019s in front of them. Or, worse, to rush towards assuming what it says. Ask Warren and Faye! Robin Williams (remember, the designer behind CRAP, not the actor) gives one tip to creating effective contrast: If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different. Lets go ahead and listen to Robin. Iteration 2: Made the movie title bigger. Much bigger. And removed the\u00a0quotes. Since the movie title is in fact the direct and only answer to our original problem question \u201cwhat is the winner of the Oscars Best Picture award?\u201d I think we can confidently say that is a damn important line that mustn\u2019t be missed. And so, I have chosen to make it the biggest line on the card. And while I was at it, I decided to drop the quotes because I felt the title was now sufficiently contrasted against the rest of the card that the quotes became superfluous. But we\u2019re not done with the body yet. As far as I can tell, the names of the producers weren\u2019t called out during the Oscars. But I can\u2019t say for sure that this would never be needed so I can\u2019t simply remove it altogether. As a compromise, I\u2019m going to mute the producers names a little. In case the awards presenter needs to call out their names, he/she can still read them without much extra effort. Iteration 3: Muted producers names Notice also that I\u2019ve chosen to keep the descriptor (i.e. the \u201cProducers\u201d title) as-is. It would have otherwise looked just like the names, which adds a little extra cognitive effort for the reader to tell them apart. By keeping the names muted and the descriptor darker, I\u2019m adding contrast between them, making it clearer to tell them apart quickly. And now it seems kind of odd to have the descriptor, Producers, come after the names. So I\u2019m going to switch them around. Iteration 4: Switched the order of \u201cProducers\u201d descriptor and their\u00a0names Sweet. Let\u2019s move on. 3) The footer is\u00a0\u2026 wait what? The title of the card is in the footer? And it\u2019s tiny?? Why!?! After the name of the winning film, the phrase \u201cBest Picture\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhich describes the award category we\u2019re actually talking about\u200a\u2014\u200ais arguably the most important piece of information on the card. It also plays a direct hand in solving our initially stated problem. In order to resolve this, I\u2019m going to swiftly move this to the top of the card. Like a-so: Iteration 5: Moved the Award Category title to the top of the card and removed the bottom\u00a0divider Phew. Ok, I think we\u2019ve got a slight hand on contrast now. Lets move on to the next principle. Repetition [Repetition] is a conscious effort to unify all parts of a design [by achieving consistency]\u200a\u2014\u200aRobin\u00a0Williams Our latest iteration above has, at first glance, a lot of different typographic stylings going on. But upon inspection, the information on it can be broken down into two types: Descriptors and Names. Names are already consistent in their typeface\u200a\u2014\u200athey are in Futura Medium. The Descriptors, however, are in two different typefaces. The Award Category title is in Palatino Italic and the Producers title is in Futura Medium. I\u2019m going to change them both to Palatino Italic. Iteration 6: Descriptors changed to Palatino\u00a0Italic Not only has this led to a more harmonized and consistent look, it also has given us a bonus contrast between descriptors and names. Neato! And speaking of contrast (it\u2019s ok if we revisit some principles non-linearly), I\u2019m starting to think we can apply some consistent contrast treatment to this card. We have two descriptors here that are in Palatino Italic\u200a\u2014\u200awhy not add a little color to further contrast them from the rest of the content? Iteration 7: Descriptors with the Oscars\u00a0tinge Ok, not bad. Lets see what else we can do. Alignment Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.\u200a\u2014\u200aRobin\u00a0Williams Good alignment in typography (and design in general) further lends visual harmony that makes things easier on the eyes and, more importantly, delivers the message more effectively. As far as our card is concerned, the content on it is center-aligned. Upon closer inspection, though, we can make this center alignment even tighter. I\u2019ll zoom in on the body and specifically the Producers line. While it is centered on the card, I\u2019m not liking how the names are lined up one after another in wrapping lines. Lets stack \u2018em. Iteration 8: Tighter center-alignment down the entire\u00a0card By stacking the names of the producers, we\u2019ve given the card a tighter visual flow. Like buttoning up the front of a suit. The name of the film still stands out and the producers take a backseat. We haven\u2019t sacrificed on clarity, so this is looking good, if I do say so myself. But here\u2019s the thing with center-alignment, though; it doesn\u2019t give a very anchored look and can lead to some general jaggedness of content. The red line roughly shows how center alignment causes some a lack of strong visual anchoring The general guidance is that if you find yourself with a lot of content, then you probably should avoid center alignment. I find, however, that it\u2019s always good practise to experiment with left and/or right alignment as well. With respect to our Oscars Award Winner card, the amount of content on it is admittedly not that much. Center-alignment probably is fine here, but we can be a bit more pedantic and bold. Just because this card will likely only be read by at most a handful of people doesn\u2019t mean we should be laissez-faire about its design! Lets try\u00a0\u2026 left-aligning it: Iteration 9: Left align the card content on a 12-column grid This looks pretty neat! The strong left-alignment gives the card a more put-together look, if you ask me. Again, this change wasn\u2019t necessary. The center-alignment would\u2019ve probably worked, but I\u2019m personally liking the left-alignment better. My only concern may be that the left-alignment may cause some of the text to be covered up by the readers hand as he/she is holding the card. I\u2019ll assume this isn\u2019t a big problem, for now. Now, onto the last principle! Proximity Group related items together. Items or groups of information that are not related to each other should not be in close proximity to the other elements, which gives the reader an instant visual clue to the organization and content of the page.\u200a\u2014\u200aRobin\u00a0Williams This one\u2019s pretty straightforward. Mostly because through our previous iterations, the groups have already presented themselves are self-evident. We just need to clean it up a bit. I\u2019ll push apart the award winner (primary content) from the Producers (secondary content), and align it all with equal padding from the top and bottom edges of the card for more visual harmony. Iteration 10: Award winner elements are in close proximity to each other, and away from the Producer elements, which are also in close proximity to each\u00a0other Now, with just a glance, we are able to tell who/what the award winner is and who the Producers are. Awesome! Insert Monkey\u00a0Wrench We could end it right here, but, just for kicks, lets throw in a surprise, as it so often happens in client work. Lets say the Oscars required the logo to be present on the card. Maybe it\u2019s their way of saying the card is official and credible. How can we go about doing this? The first thing I\u2019d do is take into account how the card\u2019s design is now visually weighted. If I were to add the Oscars logo back in, I want to ensure that it does so without disturbing the visual harmony of the card\u2019s design. Since the content on the card is currently left-aligned, I\u2019ll place the logo on the most natural counter-balancing point: the right. Iteration 11: Right-aligning the Oscars logo to counter-balance the left-aligned content Good stuff. But wait. Now the logo looks too overbearing. We don\u2019t want it distracting the reader away from the most important content: the winners. So I\u2019m going to mute it significantly. Iteration 12: Muting the logo to prevent any distraction By muting the logo, we\u2019re using the power of contrast once again to direct the reader\u2019s focus to the main part of the card, the winners. Lets revisit the problem statement I had made in the beginning: How might we provide the answer to \u201cWhat is the winner of the Oscars Best Picture Award?\u201d clearly, quickly, confidently, and accurately. Does the last card solve the above problem? I think so! But I\u2019d like to know what you think. And with that, we\u2019re done! \ud83d\udc4f One more thing\u00a0\u2026 Remember that the Moonlight card wasn\u2019t the one that caused confusion. Warren Beatty was thrown off by a card that had Emma Stone on it as the winner of the Best Actress award. And it was Faye Dunaway who blurted out La La Land as the winner after quickly glancing at the card in Beatty\u2019s hand. So lets apply the typographic treatments we went through above and apply it to what the Emma Stone card would have probably looked it. The transformation would be something like this: Do you think this redesign would have delivered the message clearly to Warren Beatty that he was holding the wrong card? Do you think this redesign would have prevented Faye Dunaway from quickly jumping to the conclusion that the winner of the Best Picture award was La La Land? Tell me in the comments below! Apparently, while my head was down on this, another designer had already beaten me to the punch. Catch this piece by benjamin bannister\u200a\u2014\u200ait provides a good alternative design!
