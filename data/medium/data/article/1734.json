Work ethic is one of those intangible traits we all value, right up there with kindness and intelligence. We tend to think only of the upside, but as this eye-opening Science of Us piece explains, unbridled work ethic can put you on the path to burnout. Image courtesy of\u00a0Unsplash The logic makes sense. Even if you\u2019re motivated for all the right reasons (pride in your work, a sense of purpose, etc.) you can still become so invested in your work that you stop prioritizing your well-being and push yourself past your limits. As writer Cari Romm puts it, \u201cUnhealthy [work ethic] is what happens when you don\u2019t know how to turn off your motivation; it\u2019s when the belief that work is inherently good transforms into the idea that downtime is inherently bad, or wasteful.\u201d Part of the problem, as Romm lays out, is that there\u2019s no agreed-upon definition of work ethic. We think of it as an all-or-nothing trait\u200a\u2014\u200aeither you have work ethic or you don\u2019t. But it\u2019s actually much more complicated and nuanced. As research from David Woehr, a management professor at Beck College of Business at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, has suggested though, work ethic is a combination of seven traits, including whether you\u2019re internally or externally motivated. There\u2019s good news within the vagueness though. Since there\u2019s no set-in-stone definition, it means we can each (individually and at the company-level) create one that aligns with our professional goals and personal needs. It\u2019s critical that companies get involved here. When workplaces have clear definitions that include boundaries between work and home and the difference between hard work and overwork, employees can reframe their own idea of what constitutes \u201cwork ethic\u201d accordingly. If Romm\u2019s definition of \u201cunhealthy\u201d work ethic sounds awfully familiar, ask yourself if you\u2019re putting work ahead of yourself. We\u2019re all for ambition, but when professional success has a higher place on your priority list than your well-being, it\u2019s time to reevaluate. Read more on Science of Us.
