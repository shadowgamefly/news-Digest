GoFundMe Heroes celebrates the everyday people who do extraordinary things on GoFundMe. \u201cGunnar was hit by a truck on February 16th of\u00a02014. I don\u2019t know if he smelled my scent, but he\u2019d followed my tracks down the driveway to the mailbox, which I\u2019d gone out to check before work. That\u2019s when a passing truck hit him. My wife called me at work, and I raced to meet them at the vet. Gunnar was crying, and his nose was bleeding. I\u2019d never heard him cry before, and it just about broke my heart.\u201d On that cold winter day in a rural Wisconsin vet clinic, Jason Parker made a decision that altered the course of his life. His black lab had a spinal injury, and the vet offered euthanasia. Instead, Jason chose to fight for Gunnar. \u201cThe next day we took him home, and I slept with him that night on the floor. In the morning, I got up to find Gunnar awake but not moving. I called a vet friend of mine, and she told me to go to the university vet clinic ASAP.\u201d Jason is a volunteer firefighter, so he knows how to stabilize patients with spinal injuries. He and his wife, Stephanie, strapped up Gunnar and hit the icy roads for the two-hour drive west to the University of Minnesota. That\u2019s where they discovered Gunnar\u2019s two broken vertebrae. His lower body was paralyzed, and his chance of recovery was only 50/50. Again, they offered to put Gunnar down. Again, Jason refused. \u201cThe problem with traumatic injury, especially for an animal, is you\u2019re never prepared for it\u200a\u2014\u200amentally or financially. It pretty much drained us.\u201d Jason and Stephanie laid out their credit cards for the over $6,000 in surgery bills that day, and then again for Gunnar\u2019s second surgery for slipped pins and the months of physical therapy that followed. But Gunnar\u2019s hind legs still didn\u2019t move\u2014and with immobility came pressure sores. Something needed to be done. Jason started researching paraplegic dogs and discovered canine wheelchairs\u200a\u2014\u200aat a hefty price of $600, which after all the bills they just couldn\u2019t afford. That\u2019s when friends stepped up and chipped in for the cart. The day Gunnar got his wheels, he took off rolling\u200a\u2014\u200amobile again at last. Inspired by his friends\u2019 kindness, Jason decided then and there that one day he\u2019d pay it forward. In August 2016, an animal rescue in Texas reached out to Jason after finding Gunnar\u2019s story on social media. They had a pit mix stray named Hope, who was paralyzed like Gunnar. They asked if he could help. Jason turned to Stephanie and said, \u201cThis is where it\u2019s gonna start.\u201d Jason found a used cart online and sent it to the shelter\u200a\u2014\u200aaddressed to Hope herself. Soon after, Jason set up a GoFundMe to collect donations for his new organization. He wanted to help other animals regain mobility and freedom. Gunnar\u2019s Wheels was born. Seven months later, Gunnar\u2019s Wheels has sent over 100 free loaner carts to animals in 30 states and three countries\u2014and Jason can still recount every animal\u2019s name and story by heart. Animals are free to use their carts until they recover or pass on, at which point Gunnar\u2019s Wheels arranges for the loaner cart to go to a new recipient. Thanks to their GoFundMe donations, Gunnar\u2019s Wheels hasn\u2019t had to turn away a single animal yet. Gunnar\u2019s Wheels has become a family affair. Jason wakes up at 5am to respond to emails before heading to work. He\u2019s partnered with three canine wheelchair manufacturers to help cut costs, and his sister reaches out to universities and vet clinics to find spare carts. Stephanie recently filed their 501(c)(3) forms and helped Gunnar\u2019s Wheels become a registered nonprofit. \u201cI hope that Gunnar\u2019s Wheels will live on. If everyone who\u2019s ever loved an animal just gave $1, we could fund this thing into the next generation,\u201d says Jason. \u201cI\u2019m hoping my kids will run this after I\u2019m gone.\u201d Jason still holds down a full-time job as a car parts salesman and helps out as a volunteer firefighter. As a first-responder in rural Wisconsin, Jason often sees a lot of high-speed freeway accidents, where he helps operate the Jaws of Life. Gunnar\u2019s Wheels has helped him cope. \u201cYou can get hard as a volunteer firefighter. You see so much tragedy you almost lose your feelings. Since Gunnar\u2019s accident, I\u2019ve really softened up. His injury, while tragic, was a blessing for me personally and I think for animals all over. \u201cI want people to realize that handicapped animals have options. We don\u2019t have to give up on them. So many times vets asked me if I wanted to put Gunnar down. If I had, all of this never would\u2019ve happened.\u201d Jason still makes an effort to talk to every animal owner on the phone before he sends out a cart: \u201cI give them advice on taking care of paraplegic animals. I want owners to know I\u2019m there for them. I try to let them know, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Help is on the way.\u2019\u201d Learn how you can support Gunnar\u2019s Wheels.
