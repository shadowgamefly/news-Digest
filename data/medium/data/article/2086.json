This is what I witnessed while photographing the Ethiopian community in the United States, specifically those residing in the Washington D.C. and Virginia area. There is a sense of nostalgia, and of wanting to still keep a part of who they are, while at the same time integrating to the U.S. society as immigrants.

The Washington D.C. area is where Ethiopians started migrating to in large numbers during the Derg Regime in the 1970\u2019s. Since then, Ethiopians have continued to migrate for various reasons, mainly for a \u201cbetter\u201d life. Today, Ethiopians account for the largest African immigrant groups in the Washington D.C. area. An Arlington-based Ethiopian Community Development Center claims that there are about 100,000 Ethiopians living in the area alone. This presence is strongly evident in some neighborhoods in the U.S. In Washington D.C., for instance, the community has a neighborhood informally dubbed as \u201cLittle Ethiopia\u201d where a significant proportion of Ethiopian-owned businesses operate and a large number of the Ethiopian immigrants reside in. The Skyline area in Falls Church, Virginia, is another hub for Ethiopian immigrants with a number of thriving Ethiopian-owned businesses. Most go there looking for Ethiopian coffee, food, spices, clothing or even live Ethiopian music. For others, it is where they get to meet and speak their own language. Faith is a strong part of their identity and religious institutions serve as a linking thread, holding the community together. This is an ongoing project that looks into identity among Ethiopian immigrants and their connection to their homeland while integrating to the American way of life.
