{"name": "641", "parent": "", "content": "A Letter to the\u00a0Brass Dear CEO, In 2014, I sat on the jury of a murder trial. The first question the defence barrister asked us was, \u2018What was the first thing you read on social media today?\u2019 It was 11am, and I had no idea, despite having being glued to my phone during an hour commute to trial. I couldn\u2019t remember one thing I had read, watched or scrolled past on my phone. Of the ten plus marketing videos that cluttered your feed this morning, tell me one thing that happened, tell me who created them, who shared it with you, tell me what the \u2018message\u2019 was. The chances are you can\u2019t. So why are we chasing it? Most marketing managers know exactly what they want they want to do. They\u2019ve done their research, checked the data, have a clear view on the story they want to tell and the audience they want to reach but it all comes unstuck when they have to convince you (the Brass) to take the plunge and enable them to build connections with their audience. \u201cWhat irritates me are people who create complications because they think they are professionals by creating complications\u201d Karl Lagerfeld Look at\u00a0retail. Shoppers are switching between brands that offer the right discount. Take Topman, they insist on telling me every morning about a different sale, a new offer an incentive to engage. Sure, I need some new jeans so I\u2019ll buy them\u200a\u2014\u200awho doesn\u2019t want cheaper jeans? But you can\u2019t buy loyalty. Bureaucracy sh*ts on creativity. As with most investments, you\u2019re the one who holds the hard cash and you need solid reassurances. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s without intention but bureaucracy sh*ts on creativity. So what happens? Marketing managers end up being forced to do low-risk activity, playing it safe. It\u2019s why we see so many emojis in marketing, as if some how *insert emoji* is suddenly going to make people buy more *insert product*. And it makes sense. No one wants you to fire them, right? But by being low risk, bureaucracy forces marketers to chase the same metrics. Obsessed with vanity, pushing for high numbers because twenty million views on Facebook equals a promotion and bonus, right? Boring. If reach is what you want for your company and brand then put your video on TV, but don\u2019t count on anyone remembering it tomorrow. They were probably at the fridge anyway. Vanity metrics do not equal longevity. It doesn\u2019t strengthen your brand, engage your audience or make anyone fancy you. If you\u2019re trying to reach a young, savvy audience who crave experience via video content then you\u2019d better let your marketeers develop a damn unique proposition as no matter how much cash you pump in, you\u2019re just another set of moving images on a relentlessly scrolling screen. Give us something we can believe in. Give us a story we can repeat. Give us a reason to champion your\u00a0brand. Take Monzo. Not only is their product revolutionising banking but Monzo have translated their vision into a brand that puts honesty, transparency and community at the heart of everything they create. monzo.com/transparency Take Supreme. There aren\u2019t any other clothing brands that evokes fandom like they do. Supreme Subway\u00a0Tickets I just have one request. Stop putting marketeers in a position where they are chasing numbers just to please you. It\u2019s your customers you should be thinking about. It\u2019ll payoff.
