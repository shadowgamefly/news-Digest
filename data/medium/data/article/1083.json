{"name": "1083", "parent": "", "content": "AIGrant: Get $5,000 for your open source AI\u00a0project After I graduated from MIT, I knew I wanted to work on open source \u2013 but I didn\u2019t have any money. For weeks after graduation, I lived in the lounge of my old dorm, sleeping on a smelly red sofa because I still had a key and the internet was fast. I\u2019d turned down some respectable job offers to sleep on that sofa and my parents were starting to worry about my judgment. Tim Ney at the Free Software Foundation took pity on me and wrote me a check for $350. The money was ostensibly for helping them with their office network, but Tim didn\u2019t ask me to do anything, and the actual effect was to keep me afloat for another couple weeks while I hacked on GNOME and worked on starting my first company. Open source was the foundation of my career and some of my closest friendships; but it\u2019s also the foundation of millions of products and ideas that only exist because you can get started by grabbing free code off the internet. It\u2019s actually hard to remember what the world was like before open source became widespread. Creating something new used to mean that your first step was to build or buy your baseline infrastructure. That\u2019s gone today, and with every new piece of open source, the price of admission gets closer to zero. I am sure that AI will be the foundation of a million new products, ideas, and companies in the future. From cars to medicine to finance to education, AI will power a huge wave of innovation. And open source AI will lower the price of admission so that anyone can participate (ok, you\u2019ll still have to pay for GPUs). So for anyone sleeping on a smelly red sofa (actual or metaphorical), I want to provide the same opportunity Tim gave me; to get a little funding to pursue a dream. I am offering five grants of $5,000 each to anyone who wants to pursue a project in AI, and open source their work. FAQs Can anyone apply? Yes \u2013 any age, any country, no credentials required. What type of project qualifies? Any project in AI, large or small, as long as you release your work under the MIT or Apache 2.0 license. If possible, any datasets employed should also be released. As for what qualifies as \u201cAI,\u201d I\u2019m open-minded. Your project can be: \u2026or anything else that feels like AI. How will you select the winners? I\u2019m looking for smart people with interesting ideas that could be useful to the world. I\u2019ll pay extra attention to projects that seem like they won\u2019t get funded another way. Some friends who know a lot about AI will help review applications (if you know a lot about AI and want to help review applications, email me!) I have a job. Can I still apply? Yes! Anyone can apply. You just need to make sure that your employer will let you release your work under the MIT or Apache 2.0 license. Can teams apply? Yes. Multiple people can apply together as a team. Please fill out a single application, but provide background information for each person in the team. You should designate a lead person to coordinate the interview as well as receive and distribute/spend the money. How does it work if I win? I\u2019ll give you 50% up front. I\u2019ll check in with you before sending the second half. Then I\u2019ll do a follow-up phone call and/or email at the end to hear how it went. I\u2019ll publish a list of all the winners on aigrant.org after they\u2019ve been selected, and maybe when the projects complete, or reach interesting milestones. During the project, you don\u2019t need to make regular reports on your progress (though I\u2019d be happy to hear from you). How do I apply? To apply, please fill out the form at aigrant.org. I\u2019ll select 10 to 20 finalists for a short interview to make sure you\u2019re a real person and to ask a few questions about your project. Winners will be chosen after the interviews are complete. What\u2019s the deadline? The key dates are: Of course, these dates are subject to change if they turn out to be wildly wrong for some reason! Can I apply multiple times? Yes, you can apply as often as you like. You can only win once. How do I get the money? I can send you the money via PayPal, wire transfer, or bitcoin. I love this idea and I want to help! Can I provide additional funding, hardware, GPU time, datasets, mentorship, or help reviewing applications? Yes! \ud83d\ude4f Thank you for being awesome! If you want to contribute in any way, please email me. Are you doing this as part of a company? Nope, this is just me. The money is an unrestricted personal gift. It\u2019s not an equity investment or loan, I won\u2019t own any of your intellectual property, and there\u2019s no contract to sign. Will this be a regular thing? Maybe! Let\u2019s see how it goes. Where did you get the idea to do this? This post is inspired by, and directly borrows many elements from Nadia Eghbal\u2019s amazing no-strings-attached grant program. Thanks, Nadia!
