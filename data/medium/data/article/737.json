Evidently pretty\u00a0long. Designing for Edge\u00a0Cases Ever wonder how long you can make a photo caption on\u00a0Medium? This illustration was created by Matt Carlson and it\u2019s a metaphor for \u201cedge cases\u201d because the car is parked at the edge of a cliff. Get it?! I promise that you\u2019ll actually learn a thing or two in this otherwise very wordy article. I\u2019ve already learned a couple of things about photo captions in the past two sentences. For one, the text isn\u2019t a hex grey. It\u2019s actually true black at 60% transparency. I figured this out when I tried to add an emoji and it looked ghostly, which comes in handy if you\u2019re actually wanting your emoji to look ghostly. Like this ghost: \ud83d\udc7b. What I do find most unfortunate is the fact that you can\u2019t add line breaks inside of a caption. To Medium\u2019s credit, this makes sense. Why would you ever have a photo caption that required line breaks? Surely users won\u2019t try to add line breaks in their photo captions, right? That said, they deserve special applause for protecting photo captions from new lines, because I was kicked out of this caption no fewer than six times each time I attempted to add a line break. Bravo! What remains to be seen is how long I can keep typing until either a) I run out of space or b) I run out of things to say. I can\u2019t think of a realistic reason that Medium would limit the length of a photo caption because, I mean who knows, maybe I have a lot to say about a photo? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s their responsibility to tell me when to stop typing. So far so good, though. Oh another thing, you can do some very basic text formatting inside of this caption. And by very basic, I mean bolding and hyperlinking. No italics here. Really the only way you can add a splash of color is by tagging someone. Like Medium Engineering. Way to go guys. You really knocked it out of the park in QA and testing! I think this is an important lesson for designers, developers, and product managers. \u201cThe user will never do that!\u201d Truth is\u2026they will. Annoying users like me will try just about everything. And the worst part about it? Usually they\u2019re not trying to be malicious or nefarious. They\u2019re just using your product however they see fit, and it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that either a) whatever they\u2019re trying to do still works, and b) you guide them back toward best practice. If you ever use Google Inbox and try to email yourself a reminder, a soft guiding hand will tell you about their \u201cReminders\u201d feature, which is more of a To Do list of sorts than a usual email reminder. Such a delightful little message! Way to go Google Developers. Side note, I discovered something new about photo captions. If you select the image and press Command+K, you can hyperlink the actual image. That\u2019s nice, but we probably already knew that. However, if you have a hyperlinked image then try to hyperlink some text inside of the caption, it won\u2019t work! You have to remove the hyperlink from the image by pressing Command+K again, then it will allow you to hyperlink text in the caption. How odd! One tiny little ProTip\u2122\u2026if you\u2019re trying to source an image from some place like Dribbble, just copy the \u201cby [author]\u201d link at the top of the Dribbble image and paste it into your article. Medium will smartly carry the hyperlink with it and past it as hyperlinked text. It\u2019s pretty convenient when your article has lots of links. So anyway, back to designing for edge cases. There\u2019s a time and a place for it. If you\u2019re doing initial concept designs for a client, either internally or externally, you shouldn\u2019t be overly concerned with supporting edge cases. That doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore them completely, but don\u2019t sweat it in the beginning. You\u2019ll end up sacrificing good design for use cases that may or may not even ever occur, and it\u2019s usually fairly easy to account for these later during the production design phase. Developers and product managers love to bring up edge cases. This is great! Someone has to consider these. Just make sure they\u2019re all logged so that you can test them later. One other note about these. Don\u2019t feel like you have to physically design for all of these edge cases. Sometimes a two-sentence explanation is all a developer needs to understand how to handle such behavior(s). Don\u2019t waste your time designing 25 edge case screens unless they actually ask to see them. You\u2019ll save yourself a lot of time and headache that way. The most important thing to know about edge cases is to be realistic and to categorically organize edge cases into groups. If you\u2019re not planning on internationalizing your product anytime soon, don\u2019t stress over 24-letter German words or supporting Japanese characters. I could literally come up with a thousand different edge cases for Medium\u2019s simplistic content editor, but they wouldn\u2019t be all that realistic or useful. Let\u2019s pretend, however, that you could design for every single edge case. Is that actually a good thing? It\u2019s not! You\u2019re just enabling users to do things in your product that aren\u2019t best practice. If it\u2019s not the right way to do something, then don\u2019t support it. That\u2019s why bowling alleys have bumpers. You start learning the game with bumpers covering the gutters until you get good enough to roll ball straight down the lane. Put bumpers in your product. Users will try all kinds of strange, weird, and wonderful things, and it\u2019s up to you to keep them headed in a straight line. This concludes my photo caption\u00a0article. Medium, you pass the\u00a0test. When I\u2019m not writing long photo caption articles, I\u2019m working on Sketch design tools at UX Power Tools to make you a better, more efficient designer.
