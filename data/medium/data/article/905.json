{"name": "905", "parent": "", "content": "The One Thing Nobody Tells You About Growing\u00a0Up 1When you were 1 year old, you thought trying to touch everything you could get your tiny hands on was a good idea. Whatever would happen next, it sure would be amazing. 2When you were 2 years old, you first learned to speak. You used that ability to be brutality honest. When you wanted mom, you said \u201cMaaa!\u201d and when you wanted dad you said \u201cDada!\u201d 3When you were 3 years old, you yelled in the grocery store that you wanted the cereal in the red box. And you didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone walking by thought about it. 4When you were 4 years old, you built the best Lego or Barbie house in the world. You were your own biggest fan, and you meant it. 5When you were 5 years old, you fell off your bike while learning to ride it. But you got up and tried again. You laughed failure in the face. 6When you were 6 years old, you began to understand the complexity of human relationships. Making friends in 1st grade isn\u2019t easy. 7When you were 7 years old, you had your first crush. Maybe you even talked to him or her once during break. Warm feelings, fuzzy feelings. Relationships get really complicated now. 8When you were 8 years old, you were first told you would have to do better on the next test, or you wouldn\u2019t do well in life. You believed it. 9When you were 9 years old, you realized to be cool you had to have the right kind of shoes. Maybe you even convinced your parents to spend $100 on a pair of sneakers and for a few seconds, you were \u201cin.\u201d 10When you were 10 years old, you really had to start thinking about your future. What level of school to go to next? Will you be smart enough for the best kind? 11When you were 11 years old, you got picked last for the soccer team. And it hurt. So the next time, you flunked practice. 12When you were 12 years old, you lied to your parents about the broken window, the fight with your friend, the way you really feel. You just had to deal with it yourself, you thought. 13When you were 13 years old, your favorite singer or band or actor was the coolest person in the world. If you could be like them, your life would be amazing. Could you? You spent a lot of time wondering. 14When you were 14 years old, you doubted your ability to excel at school and get that college degree everyone tells you is so important. What\u2019s the point of all this? 15When you were 15 years old, you learned that the world was unfair. He doesn\u2019t text back. She doesn\u2019t call. The teacher doesn\u2019t care. Your parents don\u2019t understand. Why does no one want you to get what you want? 16When you were 16 years old, you realized things cost money and it doesn\u2019t grow on trees. What are you supposed to do later to make enough of it? Lots of it? 17When you were 17 years old, you desperately wanted to figure out which of the boxes you might fit in. Accounting? English literature? Car sales? Which one could it be? 18When you were 18 years old, you understood that none of the boxes would really fit, but that you had to pick one. Lots of complaining ensued. Look at that list. Pause for a second and you\u2019ll see: You knew everything you needed to know about life when you were 5 years\u00a0old. Imagine we\u2019d stopped there and held on to who we were. Not intellectually, but in terms of our attitudes and perspectives with which we approach the world. Everything you did back then, the way you navigated life at 5 years old\u2026 \u2026it all still works. In fact, it\u2019s the only thing that works. Look at all the things we struggle for as adults: money, fame, meaning, freedom, happiness. The only way to find them is to go through life\u2026 You have done all of this before. A long time ago. Me at 5 years old. I knew it all back\u00a0then. What nobody tells you about adult life is that you have to unlearn everything you\u2019ve picked up along the way, until you\u2019re back at your 5-year-old self. Until you can see the world with those eyes again. Until you realize you were right all along. That all you have to do to move forward is to go back. We have a lot of unlearning to do. If this story resonated with you, please hit the heart \u2764, so someone else can learn to\u00a0unlearn. I write more here. Originally published at www.quora.com.
