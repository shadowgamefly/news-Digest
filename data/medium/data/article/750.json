After writing about how WhatsApp introduced Status and the whole Facebook / Snapchat dispute, then the launch of Medium\u2019s Series, now it\u2019s Twitter! In a long-awaited move from the underdog of social networks, much to the rejoice of its user-base, Twitter finally does the powerplay by introducing Stories.
