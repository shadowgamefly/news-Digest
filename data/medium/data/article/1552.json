CREDIT: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Last July, a federal appeals court struck down several provisions of North Carolina\u2019s omnibus voter suppression law, after determining that the law was designed for the very purpose of making it harder for African Americans to case a ballot. With this decision hobbling many of the state legislatures\u2019 efforts to keep black people from the polls, Democrats narrowly won the state\u2019s gubernatorial and attorney general\u2019s races in November. Nevertheless, in Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s (R-NC) final days as governor, attorneys hired by the governor\u2019s office asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, potentially creating an opening that could allow the law to be reinstated. On Tuesday, however, the state\u2019s new attorney general Josh Stein (D) formally asked the justices to dismiss that petition\u200a\u2014\u200aan act that will kill the case if the Court agrees. Stein\u2019s motion matters because, while the eight-justice Court lacked the votes to reinstate the voter suppression law prior to the 2016 election, all four of the Court\u2019s Republican appointees indicated that they were likely to support the law if North Carolina sought full review of the case. In August, North Carolina\u200a\u2014\u200athen still led by McCrory\u200a\u2014\u200aasked the Supreme Court to temporarily reinstate the voter suppression law for the 2016 election. The justices split 4\u20134 on whether to allow most of the challenged provisions to take effect. If Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat that Senate Republicans held open for a year in the hopes that Trump would get to fill it, is confirmed, then he is likely to be the fifth vote to uphold voter suppression laws like the one in North Carolina. Stein\u2019s motion seeks to take this case off the Court\u2019s docket before the justices have a chance to breathe new life into the voter suppression law. Though the Court could conceivably deny his motion, it would be extraordinary for the justices to refuse to allow a party to withdraw a petition asking them to hear a case before the justices dispose of that petition. So the good news for voting rights advocates is that, at least for the short term, the North Carolina law is likely to be dead. The bad news is that, if the Supreme Court regains a majority that is hostile to voting rights, the law could potentially be revived down the road. The four justices who voted to reinstate the voter suppression law for the 2016 election did so despite a federal appeals court\u2019s determination that the law was specifically designed to target black voters. As Judge Diana Gribbon Motz explained, \u201cthe legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices.\u201d Then, after receiving that data, it \u201cenacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans.\u201d A justice who is willing to reinstate such a law is unlikely to impose meaningful limits on states\u2019 ability to suppress the vote. And, if Gorsuch becomes the fifth vote to uphold North Carolina-style laws, the state could someday seek to re-litigate the law\u2019s legality. Or it could enact an only-slightly-modified version of the law and then ask the Supreme Court to bless that law. For the time being, however, North Carolina\u2019s voters are likely to be safe from the voter suppression law. UPDATE: Professor Rick Hasen, an expert on voting rights, notes another way that the case could potentially remain alive. Stein\u2019s press release announcing his motion states that \u201cthe State Board of Elections, its individual members, and its Executive Director will remain in the case for the time being,\u201d though it is unclear whether the board \u201ccan get or keep outside counsel.\u201d Hasen also notes that he is \u201cnot sure if the Legislature can seek to intervene at this time,\u201d potentially allowing them to continue the case against the wishes of the governor and attorney general.
