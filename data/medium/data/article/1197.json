He was a familiar face, medium build, with combed-back hair, backpack, and a focused expression. His pace was smooth and intent, as if timed exactly to reach his destination. All of this I noticed in a glance, and I smiled. I realized suddenly as I passed that this man was a dynamic part of \u201cmy\u201d world, that his merely walking by had affected me, even though I had never met him. I had seen him walking many times before, not every day, but enough that I would recognize him in the space of a breath. Unbeknownst to him, he had become part of my landscape, my world structure, and if he were to disappear suddenly, I would notice. The funny part is that he was simply being himself\u200a\u2014\u200awalking by, not waving, not smiling, not even paying attention to the passing cars. Just walking, being with himself and his thoughts. And yet, this stranger had affected me by his sheer existence, and I found myself a shade happier, just from passing his familiar form.
