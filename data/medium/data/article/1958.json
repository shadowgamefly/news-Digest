It\u2019s hard, but not impossible. It\u2019s always been hard to have a book traditionally published. It\u2019s really just numbers. There are way more people who want to be published than there are opportunities to be published. High demand equals high difficulty. So, even though the writer hires the agent, the editor, the publisher\u200a\u2014\u200athe agent, editor, publisher have so many opportunities to do their work that they don\u2019t have to really hustle for clients. People are scrambling, begging them to take most of the proceeds of each book sale. That\u2019s just the way of the world. That being said, though, if traditional publishing is your goal (and let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a goal for a lot of writers), it\u2019s not impossible. Here\u2019s how you do\u00a0it: Write a really good\u00a0book. If you\u2019re writing fiction, this is a must. No agent will look at you if you don\u2019t have a complete novel, so no traditional publisher will have the chance to consider your work. With non-fiction you can write a proposal instead of the whole book. If you\u2019re a first time writer, though, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to write your whole book even for non-fiction. Regardless, the work you turn into agents (proposal or finished draft) needs to shine. While you\u2019re writing, start building an email\u00a0list. I wish that someone had given me this advice when I sold my first novel to a traditional publisher. (Not my first ever novel, just the first one that was traditionally published.) I had eighteen months between when my book sold and when it was released. My best use of that time would have been building an email list, but I didn\u2019t know that. No one told me. So, I\u2019m telling you. You\u2019ll have an easier time appealing to an agent (and a publisher) if you have a solid foundation of readers already. It goes without saying, you\u2019ll have an easier time selling your book if you have people waiting to buy it. If you can get to 10,000 on your email list, it will make a difference. If you can get to 100,000\u200a\u2014\u200asuddenly you\u2019re not 1 in a million anymore. You\u2019re more rare, which means that suddenly agents and publishers will be more anxious to compete for your business. The truth is, you probably don\u2019t even need an agent or publisher if you build your list to that level. You certainly won\u2019t have trouble attracting one or the other or both if that\u2019s what you want. Here\u2019s one strategy for building an email list through blogging. Look for an\u00a0agent. This requires you to learn how to write a solid query letter. A query letter is a one-page sales letter that tries to entice the agent to request your manuscript or proposal. Most large traditional publishers require you to have an agent before they\u2019ll look at your work. Here\u2019s some information about writing a query letter. Write the next book. And so\u00a0on. I guess the real truth is that it\u2019s much harder to get your first book published than your second, and harder for the second than the third, etc. Writing is a skill that takes practice to master. If you keep going, you increase your chances exponentially. And if you quit, you build a block wall that your chances can\u2019t overcome. You aren\u2019t competing against every single writer trying to get a book published. I have a friend who reads an agent\u2019s slush pile. He says that a full 90 percent of the queries that come in are instant rejects\u200a\u2014\u200abecause the writing isn\u2019t there. You\u2019re only competing against the books that are publish-ready. You need to make sure your book is publish-ready. Do what it takes to get there. That means a lot of practice, a lot of reading, a lot of writing. Maybe hiring an editor. Maybe taking some classes. It means behaving like a professional writer. If you stick with it and keep improving, you\u2019ll get there. By time you do, though, you might find that you don\u2019t really want to be there anymore. The world of books is changing way faster than the world of publishing has kept up with.
