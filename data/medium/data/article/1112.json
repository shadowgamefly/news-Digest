CREDIT: Video screengrab During a meeting with state attorneys general on Tuesday, President Trump reportedly suggested the repeated bomb threats against Jewish community centers and schools around the country in recent weeks could be false flags. Those comments echo former KKK Grand Wizard and outspoken Trump fan David Duke, who has been pushing the false flag conspiracy theory. According to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro\u2019s account of the Tuesday\u2019s meeting, when the threats came up, Trump said, \u201csometimes it\u2019s the reverse.\u201d \u201cHe just said, \u2018Sometimes it\u2019s the reverse, to make people\u200a\u2014\u200aor to make others\u200a\u2014\u200alook bad,\u2019 and he used the word \u2018reverse\u2019 I would say two or three times in his comments,\u201d Shapiro said, according to BuzzFeed\u2019s Chris Geidner. \u201cHe did say at the top that it was reprehensible.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he means, or why he said that,\u201d Shapiro, who is a Democrat, added. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me.\u201d Shapiro didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking clarification, but other reporters characterized Shapiro\u2019s account of Trump\u2019s comments in a similar fashion: In recent days, Trump passed on three easy opportunities to denounce anti-Semitic hate. The topic is in the news because anti-Jewish hatred has spiked since Trump\u2019s election victory last November. ThinkProgress tracked 70 instances of anti-Semitic hate between November 9 and February 20, the highest of any marginalized group impacted by the general rise in hate incidents across the country during that same time frame. Since January alone, there have been five waves of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and schools. Trump\u2019s comments to the attorneys general echoes the false flag conspiracy theory Duke has been pushing on Twitter. Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.

No.\u201d That news conference created additional pressure for Trump to denounce anti-Semitism. He finally did during remarks from the National Museum of African American History last Tuesday. Trump claims he denounces anti-Semitism \u2018wherever I get a chance.\u2019 Actually, he doesn\u2019t.He\u2019ll tweet immediately about nonexistent events in Sweden, though.thinkprogress.org \u201cAnti-Semitism is horrible, and it\u2019s going to stop,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\u201d In response to those comments, Steve Goldstein, the executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, released a statement saying Trump\u2019s \u201csudden acknowledgement of Anti-Semitism is a Band-Aid on the cancer of Anti-Semitism that has infected his own Administration.\u201d \u201cHis statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Anti-Semitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cMake no mistake: The Anti-Semitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration\u2026 When President Trump responds to Anti-Semitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment.\u201d According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the level of anti-Semitism in public and political discourse is the worst it\u2019s been since the 1930s.
