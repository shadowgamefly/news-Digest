{"name": "639", "parent": "", "content": "Avoid a massive guest blogging fail, learn from our\u00a0mistakes So, you started your blog, created it, filled it with valuable content, followed these best practices\u2026 and now you\u2019ve started reading on how to promote your blog and stumbled upon hundreds and hundreds of blogs telling you to guest post on other blogs. But have you come across an updated lists of blogs that are actually accepting guest posts? If you have, tell us what search term you used because we haven\u2019t been able to find a list that isn\u2019t at least 3 years old. If you\u2019re having our same problem read on, because we did the research and we have the answers. The situation\u2026 Ok so, The Social Us is not really an old player. We\u2019re newcomers and as such we\u2019ve been doing what most newcomers do: We\u2019ve created valuable content to educate our readers, spread our content through multiple platforms, and accompanied all of our efforts with woke designs, and copy as strong as Rihanna\u2019s attitude. The thing is\u2026 we haven\u2019t really seen that big of a difference in our community\u2019s growth so we turned our collective eye to one of the most invaluable blogging best practices most newcomers forget: Promoting our content. Of course we\u2019ve revamped our social media strategy, and headed over to Medium (Both of those are showing the results we were expecting, which we\u2019ll of course be sharing in the future). But we also decided to give link building a try, which ended up in us following the typical advice from the more seasoned players. I.e: Skyscraping, guest blogging, making a sex tape, getting Donald Trump to fight us on Twitter, etc. We\u2019ve only tried two of those so far, and we\u2019re going to share our results with one. The Truth\u2026 Source: Jeff Sheldon |\u00a0Unsplash Making your desk look suspiciously instagram ready will take less time, effort and tears than trying to guest blog. Guest blogging is a great idea\u2026 on paper. After all, you have the opportunity to create links to your blog, have your information shown, and it helps increase traffic to your blog, and even allows you to make money blogging (some blogs offer money in exchange of blog posts, ain\u2019t that crazy AF?). But when it comes to actually doing it, things are a little more complicated than expected: Ok, so let\u2019s get down to business this is what we\u2019ve found, as of 2017 when it comes to websites that accept guest bloggers: Pros: With a lifetime visitor\u2019s count of over 300K, you bet your message will be read, they have some good content on tips about growing as a professional and their rules and guides to write \u201cfor them\u201d are not that pushy. Cons: \u201cNo freelancers or staff-writers, please.\u201d so, money is not an option here, and agencies are not welcomed. Our experience: Haven\u2019t heard back (We are staff-writers though, so\u2026) Pros: The rules are pretty standard, and at a 500 word count per article, they aren\u2019t too hard to follow. They\u2019re also visited by people in India, with with an average time on the site of 2:12. Cons: No links in the articles, but you get to put two links in your bio, and you\u2019ll need to stick to their subject matters which is mainly Digital Marketing. And well, their design is not very attractive, makes you want to shoot yourself after 5 minutes of scrolling, very visited by Our Experience: Radio Silence. Pros: They cover more topics than the standard blog, like: Blog design, content writing, video Posts and web tools. Cons: they have a single contact email, it\u2019s their editor Daniel Scocco, which means his inbox might be a little crowded so\u2026 Our Experience: After a week of waiting, we haven\u2019t got news from them. Pros: There\u2019s no writing an email you need to create an account, ask for verification and wait at least two weeks for approval, but maybe they\u2019ll eventually change it once they become more popular (we can only hope) Cons: They reserve the right to modify your piece as they see fit, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be an issue here, just follow the guidelines and everything will be fine. Our Experience: We\u2019ve followed their guidelines and haven\u2019t heard back. Maybe they just decided an email wasn\u2019t personal enough and went with a more classic reply Pros: The design is quite colorful, and Trevor Curwin who is its Editor-in-Chief has an impressive cv, this is the kind of blogs you want to be a part of. Cons: Your topic has to match their editorial line, you\u2019re better off if you just stick to these, so, read+write. Our Experience: Come on, guys, sing along with us: No response. We won\u2019t hold it against these dudes since they do tell you right off the bat they\u2019ll delete your email if your pitch doesn\u2019t meet their standards. Maybe we\u2019ll just try again in the future. Pros: There\u2019s a lot of other contributors, so if you manage to get yourself in there, you\u2019ll be in the perfect place for some serious networking. Cons: You have to register in order to star even reading or seeing the web as it is, thus it\u2019s not that famous anymore, similarweb shows a decrease of over 40% of their reach! And once you\u2019re in, chances are you\u2019ll find yourself surrounded by other people trying to get the same results as you so in terms of organic reach or link building we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll amount to much. still want to give it a shot? Their join us page will guide you through the process and give you the guidelines you need to know. Our Experience: No response. Pros: Their Guidelines are pretty easy to follow, and since they are pretty strict with their duplicate content policy is safe to assume they have a solid reputation. And they promise permanent do-follow links so long as you keep your account active and reply to comments. Cons: You have to pay to be featured. Also it isn\u2019t visually appealing, their thumbnails don\u2019t show pics, but we guess that\u2019s going to change soon (Maybe applying for a Designer position would be more profitable than trying to guest blog for them)\u00a0. Our Experience: A response telling us their fee, and a permanent headache for the writer assigned to reaching out to these blogs. Pros: They\u2019re guidelines aren\u2019t too strict. although they were falling a little bit down, they started rising up again lately. So now it\u2019s the perfect time to go and show them you have what it takes Cons: Doesn\u2019t the world \u201cSentral\u201d kinda makes you want to give up your faith in humanity? Our Experience: No response. And a heartbroken SEO writer\u2026you can always unbreak his heart by inviting him to post on your blog. Pros: they\u2019re keeping their place up-to-date with this year\u2019s tendencies, it\u2019s easy to navigate and has the \u201cguest post\u201d button on the top left of the page, their guidelines aren\u2019t hard, but are hard to read, they have a picture saying \u201cWe love guest authors\u201d photoshopped so badly that is actually kind of nice. Cons: the design is way too old fashioned, it doesn\u2019t add up anything to today\u2019s trends and kind of speaks of the same topic all the time, we get it, it says From Developers but, couldn\u2019t we write about something like the human interaction with technology. Our experience: They\u2019re liars, they say they love guest authors, but they never reply. In spite of most guides, don\u2019t even try\u00a0in\u2026 And the winner is La La\u2026 wait,\u00a0no. There\u2019s no \u201cbest\u201d way to go about link building without wasting precious resources, and coming the other side empty handed.
