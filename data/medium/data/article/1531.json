In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said the dollar was getting too strong because he inspires confidence, and though a strong dollar makes it hard to compete with countries that manipulate their currency, he will not accuse China of currency manipulation. \u201cI think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that\u2019s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that\u2019s hurting\u200a\u2014\u200athat will hurt ultimately,\u201d he added. \u201cLook, there\u2019s some very good things about a strong dollar, but usually speaking the best thing about it is that it sounds good.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency.\u201d Mr. Trump said the reason he has changed his mind on one of his signature campaign promises is that China hasn\u2019t been manipulating its currency for months and because taking the step now could jeopardize his talks with Beijing on confronting the threat of North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019re not currency manipulators,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The Treasury Department is due to release a report on currency manipulation soon, according to the Washington Post, and experts have noticed that China is intervening to raise the value of its currency, not to suppress it. On April 2 of this year, ten days before the Wall Street Journal interview was released, Trump called China the \u201cworld champions\u201d of currency manipulation and devaluations in an interview with the Financial Times. Screenshot from the Financial Times interview But Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a signature campaign issue and a regular applause line at rallies. It became a central part of his trade policy. Candidate Trump said that on his first day in office, \u201cI will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator.\u201d Not only did this amount to one of 34 \u201cDay One\u201d promises Trump broke after being sworn into office, but Wednesday\u2019s news makes clear that the promise will remain broken on Day 100. Last September, Trump told the Economic Club of New York that not only would he tell his Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, he would also apply tariffs to such countries: I\u2019m going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China, and I like China, they\u2019re my tenant, they buy condos all the time, they\u2019re just fine, but you know what, they\u2019re a currency manipulator and we\u2019re going to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. In August of 2015, he said that the the Chinese delegation would receive a McDonald\u2019s hamburger (\u201cprobably a double size Big Mac\u201d) instead of a state dinner in retaliation for currency manipulation. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t continue to devalue,\u201d Trump said on Fox News. In February of 2016 Trump said, \u201cand if they don\u2019t stop devaluing we\u2019re going to have to charge them a tax on the goods coming in.\u201d And after winning the Florida primary, Trump waxed economical about trade policy: Can I tell you what\u2019s going to happen? When China thinks you mean it, when think they you mean it, they\u2019re going to stop manipulating the currency and you won\u2019t have to do anything, and you might even have free trade. Currency manipulation is a legitimate issue to address when it comes to trade policy. As ThinkProgress\u2019 Bryce Covert reported in March of last year: Key for [Robert Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute] is tackling China\u2019s currency manipulation and any other countries that may be artificially holding down the values of their currencies. If China\u2019s policies keep the value of the yuan lower than where it would be without intervention, that makes it cheaper for the goods and services they price in that cheaper currency for other countries to buy. \u201cIt acts like a subsidy to everything that China and other countries export to the U.S.,\u201d he said, and it \u201cacts like a tax on all U.S. exports to China and to every country where we compete with China in the world.\u201d After news broke that Trump would not be labeling China a currency manipulator and would also like to see a weaker dollar, the value of the dollar fell sharply, before regaining some of its losses.
