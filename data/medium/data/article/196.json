I\u2019ve polished down my edges, sort of speak. I\u2019m layered with years of being concerned with love as the driving force of my existence. I\u2019ve fallen in love in an instant. I\u2019ve fallen in love over time. I\u2019ve waited for love to have sex, and had sex only to find love. I\u2019ve married young, duh! Like any good hopeless romantic. I\u2019ve divorced too, just like my mother. I see stories in people more than I see people. Stories in men that are so willing to tell me their stories. My first dates are never intrascentental-they\u2019ve all had meaning. They\u2019ve turned into friendships; into crushes that swirve in and out of sight and over time into regret or forgiveness; into indeleble marks; even into marriages\u2026 For some fucking reason, I\u2019ve gotten away with being this self-involved, this self-confident for this long. But it\u2019s all a lie. I\u2019m really not that self-involved, if I was, I\u2019d be a lot more involved with myself than with \u201clove.\u201d I feel you require an explanation: I\u2019ve recently understood, due to my second divorce, that I\u2019ve placed more value in receiving love, than in giving love. This is a double-edge sword. Edge#1: receiving love isn\u2019t love. It\u2019s the shortest route to not feeling alone, which is one of my biggest fears, according to my fears. Edge#2: receiving love distracted me from having to love myself. This is the kind of stuff that now keeps me up at night. I\u2019ve led a life of super-sensitivity and now find myself numb without the one thing that I\u2019ve found easy to come by: love. But love, I imagine, is more than two strangers connecting over a cigarette one crisp New York night. Or that feeling that the crowd parted perfectly in half so that we could meet. Or a cabin in the Poconos where a hipster and a poet went night fishing. Or a stolen dance in Havana that turned into a \u2018this is me and I love you that\u2019s why I kiss you on the forehead\u2019 kind of moment in El Malec\u00f3n. I\u2019ve grown tired of love, I know it because I\u2019ve started to like myself more lately. There\u2019s something strong developing, against my questionable judgment, inside of me. It\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling, to only have yourself to worry about. Nobody to steer you in the direction of their expectations. No wars to wage for somebody else\u2019s sake.
