{"name": "717", "parent": "", "content": "How to UX the F*** out of Fake\u00a0News We\u2019ve all heard the terms \u201cFake News\u201d and \u201cAlternative Facts\u201d so many times it\u2019s annoying. That being said, it\u2019s a problem that needs to be addressed. In this post I\u2019m going to give you a few design techniques you can put in your UX toolbox to design experiences that squelch fake content. But first, let me quickly illustrate what we\u2019re talking\u00a0about Just yesterday (March 29, 2017), it was revealed that The Kremlin employed 1,000+ people to create fake stories targeting key swing states in the 2016 U.S. Election. There were upwards of 1000 internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia, in effect taking over a series of computers which are then called botnets, that can then generate news down to specific areas. ~ U.S. Senator Mark Warner Fake news is often intentionally created with a predisposed bias, then is shared within target demographics (who create an echo chamber around it), and sometimes it is even bolstered by likes and comments from networks of bots (like in the 2016 election example above). Most fake content exists to influence the opinions of you and me. Most fake content is political and intended to influence opinions Fake News on Facebook Some is just satirical content mistaken as real that goes\u00a0viral Other types attempt to influence on much more serious\u00a0matters 2017 is the year designers start caring about the content that their users create and share on their platforms. It\u2019s a big year for us. As product creators, we\u2019ve traditionally exempted ourselves from responsibility when it comes to content in our products. How many times have you heard a designer or a developer say: \u201cWe\u2019re just creating the platform. Users provide the content.\u201d Not anymore. When it comes to content that misleads the masses, inspires hate, and fails to inform correctly\u2026 We\u2019re accountable. Product designers are on the hook, not to censor or bias content, but to provide a mechanism that informs their users of the reliability of the content being disseminated in their products. All credit goes to Onion.com for this masterful piece of Fake\u00a0News We need a UX framework to prevent fake\u00a0content Every product that relies on content sourced from its users must build into their design features a mechanism to actively hinder fake content. Calling people out on their content is really uncomfortable. But it\u2019s of tantamount importance that we do so. There are disputed facts. But there are also truths and lies. Amidst our culture of political correctness, we must acknowledge this. News outlets are already doing this. Products with user-generated content must follow suit. We must design our products to support firm truths, counter firm lies, and enable dialogue about disputed facts. The product features we design to counter fake content must be stern, yet gracious\u200a\u2014\u200acorrective, yet humble\u200a\u2014\u200apersuasive, yet unbiased\u200a\u2014\u200ainformative and bullet-proof. This fake content prevention framework must never censor content. It must never prevent the flow of information (even false information). Knowledge is power, censorship is\u00a0not. The framework should: The framework must do all these things with grace. It must honestly, without bias or agenda, expose lies and reveal the truth. Presenting the Fake Content Prevention Framework I\u2019ve designed such a framework, a UX guide for firmly but respectfully fighting and hindering the dissemination of fake content. Understanding the Fake Content Prevention Framework There are four main components that make up the skeletal structure of a \u201cFake Content Prevention\u201d mechanism: 1) The Validation Engine The backbone of fake news prevention is the Validation Engine. It is the mechanism by which you catch blatantly false content and by which you measure a post, and a poster\u2019s, reliability. Important: the Validation Engine does not: The Validation Engine has 2 critical duties: Facebook\u2019s new disputed content feature flow: The Validation Engine is built by combining these 4 things: Snapchat has a rigorous review and approval process that \u201cDiscover\u201d publishers must adhere\u00a0to Avoid polarizing terms when your validation engine flares content. For example, Facebook has chosen to use the term \u201cdisputed\u201d with a red tag and warning icon in their content-monitoring What if you can\u2019t build enough of a case to prove a story is Fake News? Don\u2019t touch it. I repeat: if your validation engine is unsure, don\u2019t touch it. There is such a thing as degree of certainty, only flare content as disputed if your validation engine has a high degree of certainty that it is faulty. The goal of your Validation Engine is to inform about common myths and slow down potentially-viral Fake News\u00a0stories. Note: it\u2019s not possible, and not even necessary, to catch all fake content postings. It\u2019s better to have some fake content slip through the cracks than to have true content censored and the reliability of your product put at risk. 2) The Citation Experience If a piece of content is flared as disputed, it\u2019s important to let users know why it\u2019s unreliable. The citation experience allows curious users to dig into the sources and reasoning backing up the flare. It\u2019s a critical component to building reliability into your product\u2019s validation system and informing your users. You citation experience should include the following things: Facebook\u2019s \u201cCitation Experience\u201d. It\u2019s pretty generic and could use some work in my\u00a0opinion. 3) The Reliability Cues Integrate reliability visually into your product by tying it to user profiles and published content. These are publicly visible cues that users can come to trust to inform them of the reliability of the content they are viewing. Give all users a \u201cReliability Rating\u201d A rating based entirely on the factual accuracy of their past posts. This reliability rating is public, and thus creates an environment where people fight for the value of their reputation and start to feel a sense of ownership over the content they disseminate. Online bullying and soap-boxing are often side effects of people being able to hide behind their online profiles. Online profiles often have no mechanism of accountability. A Reliability Rating begins to help people understand the consequence of their actions online. Our culture really hates labeling people (often for good reason), but we\u2019ve reached a point where we need to be okay calling a liar a liar when it comes to objective facts. Labeling someone as a \u201creliable\u201d or \u201cunreliable\u201d source may be a scary thought at first, but if it\u2019s purely based in how factual their words are, should it be? \u201cVisual design and User Experience can be used as a powerful force to give people quick indications of the quality of what they\u2019re reading and sharing.\u201d ~ Jeremy\u00a0Johnson Give posts a \u201cReliability Rating\u201d For false content, this is the \u201cdisputed\u201d flare we talked about previously. You could go so far as providing a reliability rating (or flare) for proven-to-be-true content, or unproven-but-not-disproven content. The goal here is to accurately inform users about each piece of content they absorb and to gain trust. Flock.co has this feature in their team messaging app. They call their validation engine the \u201cFake News Detector,\u201d and it works by \u201ccross-referencing the URLs of links shared on Flock against a database of more than 600 verified fake news sources. Any fake news is immediately flagged with a highly visible icon and red bar alongside the preview of the URL. Using this tool, Flock users can easily identify fake news and refrain from sharing such content.\u201d The Fake News Detector (FND) flags unreliable content when shared on Flock (flock.co) To take this one feature step further, completely unreliable content can be collapsed by default, to hamper users from knee-jerk liking as they scroll down the page and to prevent snowballing viral-ity that is so-common with provocative fake content. Collapsed content takes a conscious effort to expand and acts as a gateway that alerts the user that they\u2019re viewing blatantly false content. 4) The Private Feedback Mechanisms It\u2019s important to enable private dialogue between individuals. Conversation and debate are healthy ways to build understanding. Privacy is important here to prevent brigading and bullying. Instead of only providing an option for a community member to \u201creport inaccurate content\u201d, present users with the opportunity to directly engage the offending user in dialogue via private messaging. Facebook allows users to direct message each other about Fake\u00a0Content Additionally, allow content-posting users to file complaints with your validation engine and product support team if they feel like their content has been unjustly flared or disputed. Give posters the opportunity to argue their case. We\u2019ve become a consumption based culture that has a hard time identifying with \u201cthe other\u201d (whatever that \u201cother\u201d might be), and encouraging engagement and meaningful dialogue is one step back in the right direction towards building common ground and inspiring empathy in each other. Ultimately, you can\u2019t completely stop fake\u00a0content But it can dissuade it and inform busy users. As product owners, that\u2019s really as far as we can take it at this point in time. You could even argue that\u2019s the full extent of what we\u2019re responsible for, and I may just agree with you. Here\u2019s the takeaway: your product doesn\u2019t have to stop all fake content. You\u2019ll die of anxiety before you can even get close to achieving this. But you can\u2019t not try. Preventing a few of the worst posts from going viral is better than not catching anything at all. And from there you can only get better at it. Designers today must take some level of accountability for the content being disseminated in their products. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not your fault. It is your responsibility.\u201d ~Terry Pratchett, Author You\u2019re responsible for walking the tightrope. Uphold freedom of speech. Avoid bias. Inform users. Don\u2019t let lies fly unchecked.
