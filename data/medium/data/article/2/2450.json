Complaint exposes the ugly consequences of \u2018social\u00a0justice\u2019 On her LinkedIn profile, Chelsea Leibow calls herself a \u201cPatriarchy-Smashing PR Priestess.\u201d In a complaint filed last month with New York\u2019s Human Rights Commission, however, Ms. Leibow calls herself a victim of sexual harassment. According to Ms. Leibow, while she was employed by the Manhattan-based firm Thinx, her boss \u201cgroped female underlings\u2019 breasts, pranced around the office naked, and video-chatted workers from the toilet.\u201d The alleged perpetrator of these offenses was not the \u201cpatriarchy,\u201d but rather Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal, a self-declared feminist whose company specialized in marketing blood-absorbing underwear for menstruating women. Ms. Agrawal was celebrated as an entrepreneurial example for young feminists when she published her book Do Cool Sh*t: Quit Your Day Job, Start Your Own Business, and Live Happily Ever After. As recently as February 2016, Ms. Agrawal declared that she had \u201cbuilt a business that is centered around my beliefs in gender equality\u201d and that \u201cfeminism is an integral part of our brand strategy.\u201d So what was it like to work for this feminist company? According to a complaint filed [by Ms. Leibow] (and echoed in interviews with multiple current and former employees), [Ms. Agrawal talked about] the size and shape of her employees\u2019 breasts, an employee\u2019s nipple piercings, her own sexual exploits, her desire to experiment with polyamory, her interest in entering a sexual relationship with one of her employees, and the exact means by which she was brought to female ejaculation.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Agrawal also touched an employee\u2019s breasts and asked her to expose them, routinely changed clothes in front of employees, and conducted meetings via videoconference while in bed, apparently unclothed. (She also is said in the filing to have shared nude photos of herself and others\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cincluding but not limited to her fiance\u0301\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awith staff.) At least once, she supposedly FaceTimed into a meeting from the toilet.The complaint\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. also describes a culture of fear and a pattern of ageism, in which members of the mostly female, mostly 20-something staff were routinely referred to as \u201cchildren,\u201d with the few employees in their 30s tagged \u201cnannies.\u201d\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [D]espite the company\u2019s feminist branding and mission, the women who worked there felt exploited by low pay and substandard benefits. The complaint notes that the only two employees who had evidently successfully negotiated higher salaries were men. We could take this as an opportunity to ask whether rude, crude and discourteous behavior in the workplace is necessarily \u201csexual harassment.\u201d As Professor Daphne Patai explained in her book Heterophobia, the concept of \u201csexual harassment\u201d as a form of illegal discrimination against women originally concerned only the demand for sex as quid pro quo, where male superiors used their authority to extort sexual favors from female workers as a requirement of their employment, with rewards for compliance and the threat of dismissal for non-compliance. During the 1980s and \u201990s, however, court decisions expanded the concept of illegal harassment to include so-called \u201chostile environment\u201d discrimination. In effect, this meant that merely making an off-color joke or commenting on a co-worker\u2019s appearance could be claimed as evidence of harassment or discrimination. This shift in the meaning of \u201csexual harassment\u201d was highlighted during the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Nothing alleged by Anita Hill amounted to \u201csexual harassment\u201d as most people understood that term. Whether or not Ms. Hill\u2019s accusations against Thomas were true, she did not claim that he made a quid pro quo demand for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment, nor was there evidence that Thomas engaged in retaliatory punishment (toward her or anyone else) for a refusal to provide such favors. Yet the allegations of \u201cunwelcome sexual comments\u201d were used to attack Thomas as unfit to serve as a federal judge, an attack he famously called a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d What do Chelsea Leibow\u2019s allegations against Miki Agrawal tell us? Perhaps that feminism involves a double-standard in which women believe they can behave in ways that they would find offensive if a man did the same thing. Feminism often seems to be interpreted as carte blanche for women to engage in abusive or selfish behavior as \u201cempowerment.\u201d How else to explain why a woman who made \u201cgender equality\u201d such a focus of her business would have (allegedly) operated a workplace governed by a \u201cculture of fear\u201d where female employees \u201cfelt exploited by low pay and substandard benefits\u201d? What this double-standard conceals is that the feminist commitment to \u201cgender equality\u201d does not benefit all women equally. Ms. Agrawal is the child of prosperous immigrant parents who sent her and her sisters to Ivy League universities. As a graduate of Cornell, Ms. Agrawal is \u201cprivileged\u201d in a way that transcends race and gender and, indeed, being a minority woman could be a big career-booster, thanks to government policies aimed at helping allegedly disadvantaged people in the name of \u201csocial justice.\u201d Women like Miki Agrawal may become so accustomed to favorable treatment from schools, businesses and other institutions committed to goals of \u201cracial diversity\u201d and \u201cgender equality\u201d that they succumb to hubris. The complaints against Ms. Agrawal remind us of the timeless lesson taught by George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, when the revolution ends with the amended slogan: \u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201d Those who urge us to join them in a revolution to achieve \u201cequality\u201d either haven\u2019t learned that lesson, or else they figure that the rest of us don\u2019t remember how revolutions always have a way of eating their own. Chelsea Leibow may still wants to smash the patriarchy, but it wasn\u2019t the patriarchy that led her to hire on with Miki Agrawal\u2019s feminist company, and if she hasn\u2019t learned her lesson yet, she probably never will.
