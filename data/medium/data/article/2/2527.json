I believe in most cases where people tend to use it, they\u2019re using it wrong. The Data There is a lot more money coming in crypto and blockchain startups. As more big companies invest in blockchain related startups you\u2019ll see more speculators jumping on this new \u201cWild West\u201d market where there are no rules. When we look at the total marketcap of all cryptocurrencies together: When we look at the Bitcoin chart we see the following: It is important to note that without MtGox Bitcoin would\u2019ve never gone that high back in 2013\u20132014. The Analysis Every investor, trader and speculator is looking for the \u201cnew Bitcoin\u201d.
