{"title": "Be Someone Who Thinks Differently", "name": "2437", "content": "Be Someone Who Thinks Differently \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They\u2019re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who\u00a0do.\u201d This is taken from a famous Apple ad. It helped put the company back on track after Steve Jobs returned to revive them from near-bankruptcy in 1997. It\u2019s touching, inspiring, and empowering. It\u2019s how marketing should be done. But why is it relevant to the rest of us? Not all of us can, will, or want to change the world. There\u2019s an easy answer. Because you\u2019re not always at the center of a bell-curve, and that\u2019s who the status quo caters to. You live a unique life, and it demands a unique outlook. A Few Things the Status Quo\u00a0Says.. Is it good advice? For some people, yes. But there is also more to the story. Let\u2019s Talk About the Other\u00a0Side \u201cSuccess is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRay\u00a0Dalio The status quo is unapologetically biased towards average in EVERY situation. Sometimes, in certain instances, sure, you\u2019ll fall close to the middle of the bell-curve, and that\u2019s fine. But much of the time, you\u2019ll be navigating the corners, and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll be punished. Societial rules don\u2019t cater there. We live in a complex world, and we have complex lives based on a personal combination of memories and emotions. They don\u2019t fit a predefined mold. It\u2019s critical to understand the existing conventions, structures, and systems. They provide a reference point, and more often than not, they are useful. But it\u2019s far more critical to know that they also aren\u2019t set in stone. Outside of the law and the boundaries of modern science, much of reality is flexible. Almost everything around us that we presume to be fixed and static was produced and labeled by other people. There is no law in the universe that invents ideas and implements them. Powerful brains, like yours, do that. The world\u200a\u2014\u200aif understood well\u200a\u2014\u200acan be reshaped with the right tools. What Are These\u00a0Tools? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have [mental] models in your head\u2026 and the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aCharlie\u00a0Munger You need to understand the world from as many diverse angles as you can. Mental models are a way to do that. They provide a fundamental framework for deciphering complexity so that you can optimize your decision-making. A common example is Pareto\u2019s Principle (80/20 Rule), which tells us that in any domain about 80 percent of results come from 20 percent of the causes. In businesses, about 80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers. In software, 20 percent of the code accounts for about 80 percent of errors. Another is Cost-benefit Analysis. It\u2019s a systematic approach to evaluating the different avenues ahead and weighting their positives and their negatives. Each of them, in their own way, help us make sense of the noise around us. They either explain a generally observed trend, or they give us a method for breaking down and ordering information in a way that\u2019s a little more useful. A Few Models I Find\u00a0Valuable The world is messy. It can\u2019t be viewed through a single lens. It needs to be simplified and approached from a multi-dimensional viewpoint, and a well-diversified collection of mental models are the best way to do that. They allow room for flexible evaluation, and they accurately assess how reality interacts with the different components of your own personal life. A good combination of mental models are a far better tool to make life decisions than blindly accepting the status quo because you\u2019re supposed to. Explore different disciplines and create your own personal toolkit of models. A Better Approach to\u00a0Life \u201cEverything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it. Once you learn that, you\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSteve\u00a0Jobs If you ask good questions, strive to always learn, and develop a strong mental framework for evaluating the divergence between where you are and where you want to be, you\u2019ll be able to navigate the world far more successfully. To do that, however, you have to think for yourself. You need the courage to walk away from the majority, and you need the audacity to follow through. You\u2019re not just a passenger hoping to observe reality but leave it untouched. You\u2019re a participant, and your job is to challenge it and carve your own way. Know the rules. But more importantly, know when to break them. Worth reading? Please press the\ud83d\udc9a and share it with friends. It helps more people see it. Want more? Join me at Design Luck.
