It\u2019s the parable of the tree-chopping team that is so focused on efficiency of how fast it can fell a tree that it doesn\u2019t bother to make sure it is clearing the forest in the right direction when one person actually stops the constant cutting to climb a tree and make sure they\u2019re cutting in the right direction. On the surface this person is losing efficiency but in the long-run the gains for direction setting are huge. This has always resonated with me because each of us has such limited time and ability to get things done personally that our impact is much great from direction setting. And measuring activities or output can mislead you into thinking you\u2019re doing a great job. So my corollary has always been \u201cdoing the right things is more important than doing things right.\u201d Sounds simple but in practice I promise you most organization fall into the latter trap. Here\u2019s how it goes: You have a business development group with two people. They are tasked with \u201cgetting deals done\u201d so they race around talking to tons of potential partners inking anything from channel sale deals, product integration, international distribution agreements, co-marketing arrangements, M&A discussions, etc. You can often measure how many deals were achieved but there often doesn\u2019t flow a steady stream of revenues / profits from these deals. That is your fault as a leader because biz dev folks will measure deals rather than impact unless you set their direction. You have a marketing department with three people. They\u2019re tasked with doing\u00a0\u2026 marketing. So they create a task list of all the marketing activities an organization can do: press releases, web site updates, customer case studies, blog posts, daily Tweets, Facebook fan page, attending conferences, etc. You get a lot of traffic\u200a\u2014\u200anot always results. If you aren\u2019t careful every PR team will measure inches over impact. Vanity metrics will make you feel good about site traffic of SEO over conversion rate or purchases of your product will get more attention than retention. Efficiency can be an addictive drug. The fact is\u200a\u2014\u200ayou manage what you measure. When you hire people in functional roles they want to show that they\u2019re achieving results and results are easiest to measure by tasks accomplished. But many CEO\u2019s and management teams fail to set clear guidelines on what the company objectives are and make sure that everybody is driving toward the same goal. It\u2019s actually quite hard to lay out an annual company strategy that is articulate and underpinned by facts. So many CEO\u2019s just carry on being\u00a0\u2026 CEO\u2019s \u2192 fund raise, get media attention, attend conferences, hire staff, \u201cset direction\u201d, whatever. But this leads to organizational drift because staff will continue to produce \u201cwork.\u201d The reality is that you might be better off doing less activity but doing \u201cthe right\u201d activities really well. To do the right activities you need to start with a top down assessment with what you\u2019re trying to achieve in your organization. It\u2019s why I always encourage teams to learn how to do \u201ctop town thinking\u201d and not just bottom-up planning. I often find and eschew CEO\u2019s who want press coverage, want to always be at conferences and speak on panels or want to copy features that their competitors offer without knowing whether their customers care about these features. So they direct staff to meet these objectives without considering what the purpose of activity is and what the end result will be. People will certainly follow orders and do the things you ask of them. It is more rare for me to find founders with a strong sense of purpose who are \u201cmission driven\u201d and not easily distracted by competition, praise or what others think. These tend to be the founders I back and in the first few years if the public is head scratching a bit\u200a\u2014\u200aI usually think it\u2019s more likely we\u2019re heading in the right direction. No true innovation breakthroughs come from doing what\u2019s obvious. Do the hard work and try to define your companies objectives and get them on paper. Be clear on your mission. Everybody should be able to answer the question, \u201cwhy am I doing this?\u201d Otherwise they\u2019re likely to be doing things right, but not the right things.
