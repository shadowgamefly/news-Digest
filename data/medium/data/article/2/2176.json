Blueprinting is not about documenting the customer experience. It uses the customer experience as starting point, and unpacks it to expose how the organization supports that journey."}, {"a0ee": "This is why a blueprint can seem detached from the customer and detached from the empathy that designers are told again and again is the top priority.

That narrative is a powerful tool to rally a group around true human-centered design, and that can be an end unto itself."}, {"42d9": "If you already have a good understanding of your customer experience, or identified a particular pain point for the customer or the internal teams, then blueprinting should be your next step."}, {"a1cd": "It will allow you to dive deep into how you deliver an experience and how your organization functions (for better or worse), allowing you to address organizational pain and breakdown of processes internally.

In cases like these, you might consider using the journey mapping tool to map the emotional experiences of your internal actors in order to understand organizational pain, challenges, and opportunities for improvement."}, {"ecbc": "Blueprinting is an obvious must in these cases, because it will help you understand the complexities of your organization, and let you tie underlying factors to a customer journey so that you don\u2019t lose sight of how future changes\u200a\u2014\u200ain the form of reduced costs, increased efficiency, boosted moral, and the overall health of the business itself\u200a\u2014\u200amight impact the customer."}, {"608a": "We have to pay attention to these internal organizational experiences just as much as we pay attention to the customer experience."}, {"c966": "Conclusion"}, {"3b13": "Journey mapping and service blueprinting are both critical methods to understand and use in doing service design work.

We need to understand the notion of \u201cthe stage\u201d in service design, a cornerstone concept that is essential for understanding the difference between customer journeys and service blueprints. \u201cThe stage\u201d is comprised of three perspectives: the front stage, the backstage, and the behind-the-scenes. The literal metaphor is helpful here. If you imagine a simple stage in a theater, the front stage is where the action happens and what the audience can see; for us, customers act on the front stage. The backstage is where all the support processes live that produce the front stage, the lights, the sets, the crew, all of which should be invisible to the customer, but often isn\u2019t.

These three places are where service design has the opportunity to make an impact. Through different methods, we can better understand different stages. Let\u2019s talk about the methods in question. What is a journey\u00a0map? A journey map captures iconic experiences that customers have, from their point of view; the front stage of the service experience. In creating a journey map, you use customer narratives and customer data to plot their experience over time, mapping what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, and what they are interacting with along the way. What you end up with is a visceral journey that helps you see and evaluate the experience your customer is having from their point of view. A good journey tells the story of what the customer went through as a narrative that flows like an author wrote it; the author being the customer. It contains all the richness of the experience\u200a\u2014\u200athe emotion, the internal dialog, the highs and lows\u200a\u2014\u200athat a true story would.

You can create a journey map by interviewing customers to capture their insights, and then map them against each other to find commonalities, patterns, and trends. In addition, you can also piece together a customer journey map from data that is already being collected on the customer experience. This method helps you map and make visible the end-to-end of the experience a customer has. This is the front stage of the experience, and is comprised of all the interactions they have in the context of their lives and how they interface with your business. Beyond capturing the current experience your customers are going through, journey mapping can also be used to imagine and ideate on the future, using the format as a tool to speculate on what a customer might see and do in a future experience. Typically, a journey map is not a depiction of an actual real-world, single customer\u2019s experience. A journey map is an aggregate of experiences compiled from customer research and the knowledge of subject-matter experts in your organization. The nature of how customers traverse the stage is unique to every single customer, but when you aggregate those paths together into a narrative, it helps you see the experience as a journey from the customer\u2019s perspective. This is a powerful storytelling tool that paints a picture and allows people a chance to see something through a common lens. Journey mapping builds empathy and also lets you identify areas of the experience that you want to improve or learn more about. What is a service blueprint? Now let\u2019s turn to service blueprinting. Where journey mapping focuses on exposing the end-to-end of your customer\u2019s front stage experience, blueprinting focuses on exposing the surface-to-core of the business that makes up the backstage and behind the scenes of how you deliver and operate, and ties that to the customer\u2019s experience. What journey maps and customer narratives don\u2019t show is the internal workings of the organization. The service blueprint seeks to uncover and document (often for the first time!) all the things that go on beneath the surface and the internal makeup of the organization that creates it. It is data visualization of how your company works; the deep, dark inner workings of how the things a customer experiences are actually produced. There are huge complexities that go unseen that are the support structures beneath every journey\u200a\u2014\u200athe responsibilities of the internal actors, the systems that support those actors, all the processes and policies that dictate what can and cannot be done. Service blueprinting shows you a picture that not only includes the breadth of what happens along the journey, but all the depth that makes up the substance that the journey traverses across. Building the blueprint To create a service blueprint, you first need to have identified one or more end-to-end journeys, called scenarios, that you want to blueprint. These scenarios should be based in the customer journey, but can also include organizational scenarios that happen internally away from the customer\u2019s view. It is the story of what happens at each step along the way to make the scenario \u201cgo.\u201d By going deep into each step in the scenario, you can expose the breadth and depth of the experience that supports and produces the stage where the journey takes place. This process relies on a cross-functional collaboration between different parts of the organization, in order to represent all aspects of the external and internal experience.

We have to pay attention to these internal organizational experiences just as much as we pay attention to the customer experience. Conclusion Journey mapping and service blueprinting are both critical methods to understand and use in doing service design work. It is important to understand the difference between the two, and how they compliment each other. Journey mapping is about a front stage lens through which to better understand and empathize with the customer\u2019s experience. Blueprinting is about the backstage (and behind-the-scenes) of your business and how that backstage ties to the customer\u2019s experience. Whether you are seeking deeper understanding of the experience your organization has created, or a deep analysis of your business, these methods will help you identify ways to create meaningful improvements to your internal processes and your customer\u2019s experiences. The next time you look at a customer journey, try digging beneath the surface to look down to the core of what is supporting that journey. Understanding how it all adds up to create that surface customer journey means now you know. And knowing is half the battle.
