Every time you ask for money you\u2019re faced with the possible of feeling literally and figuratively like a failure. I understand this instinct for more capital and I have two very different personal experiences: In my first company we raised an A-round of $16.5 million and in my second company we raised only $500,000 by choice. I have this \u201cHow much should I raise?\u201d conversation literally every week with startups. While there is no science to it, here is how I think through the issues with founders: 1. You will spend what you raise in the same timeframes whether you raise $1.5 million or $4\u00a0million. It is a truism that with more capital you will hire people more quickly and spend more liberally whether it\u2019s on external contractors, PR firms, attending events, doing legal work (trademarks, patents) or whatever. You will build out features or expend to platforms\u200a\u2014\u200aoften before you have enough market feedback to warrant it. I was reminded of this yesterday watching my friend Justin Kan on Snapchat with this 10-second reminder, \u201cNo matter how much you raise at your company you\u2019ll end up spending it in 12\u201324 months\u201d I would probably amend it to say 12\u201318 months. People do what people do. You have money, you spend it. And there are consequences for spending too much money. I was always fond of saying about fund raising, \u201cWhen the hor d\u2019oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later. Just don\u2019t take the whole tray.\u201d My analogy was that there are markets where it\u2019s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70% of what you raise on a pace of 18 months. But people never do. Justin is right. 2. How much you raise determines valuation I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise. There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15\u201330% with the most common range 20\u201325% per early stage round. So the temptation would be to ask for $5 million because that implies a $20 million pre-money valuation if you\u2019re able to only give away 20% or a $15 million pre-money valuation of investors require 25%. A $15\u201320 million valuation sounds better than an $8 million valuation, doesn\u2019t it? It seems almost silly to argue that it\u2019s better to have an $8 million valuation. But it\u2019s actually not that silly. For starters if you raise at an $8 million pre-money valuation you\u2019re much more likely to raise $2\u20133 million and not $5 million. It\u2019s infinitely easier to raise $2\u20133m than $5m so you have a higher hit-rate. 3. The larger the round, the higher the price, the harder the next hurdle is to\u00a0hit But the bigger point I want to make is what happens when the coffers are depleted and you need more money? That is where over-raising can be corrosive. What felt great when you raised it $5 million on $20 million now feels like a noose around your neck because raising at an up-round of $8\u201310 million at a $40\u201350 million pre-money valuation is stratospherically harder than raising at a $20 million valuation. Why? Because investors need to imagine making a minimum of 10x their invested capital and early-stage investors are shooting for even higher multiples. The data suggests that the investors have a much easier time hitting a $100\u2013200 million outcome than a $400\u2013500 million outcome so it\u2019s easier to commit at lower prices. And if you raise the \u201c5 on 20\u201d and don\u2019t grow into your next-round valuation you\u2019re stuck because venture investors HATE doing down rounds. They\u2019re corrosive in your relationship with the early VCs, the management teams will take them if they must but they end up feeling demotivated and in a venture world where great new deals are always coming around\u200a\u2014\u200awhy commit to somebody else\u2019s problem child? 4. Constraints can spark creativity Of course it never feels this way when you\u2019re the founder, but constraints can actually force creativity. Each person is the company has to personally do more vs. lead others doing work. Each person in the company has very short timeframes for making progress because you know proof-points are critical in fund raising. And importantly\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving limited resources forces you to make hard choices about what you\u2019re build and what you won\u2019t. It forces harder decisions about whom you\u2019ll hire and whom you\u2019ll delay. It forces you to negotiate harder on your office lease and take more frugal space. It forces you to keep salaries reasonable in a market where wage inflation has been the norm for years. I like talking about it as \u201cholding one\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d because it\u2019s an idiomatic way of reminding yourself of the obligation to constantly show progress. The two biggest measures for me of early-stage company capabilities are: Mo\u2019 money, less fire. 5. Some people can skip first\u00a0base My partner Greg Bettinelli has a sports metaphor that I\u2019ve become fond of which is \u201cskipping first base.\u201d Internally at Upfront it\u2019s an entrepreneur who has enough of a proven track record that they can raise a $5\u201310 million A-round based on their prior experiences. I like the skip first base metaphor because for some entrepreneurs they really deserve to start on second base. Maybe they worked much of their career running a startup in a sector and years later they want to go after that market again and they know from day 1 what they want to build, why and why it would work or fail. Second-base entrepreneurs often know a large number of talented technology professionals and other executives who would gladly come back and work for him or her so team assembly is both quick and impactful. Second-base entrepreneurs often have the credibility to raise follow-on capital due to their historic track records and/or their venture relationships so clearing the valuation bar on a subsequent round becomes easier. When we think about second-base entrepreneurs we think in terms of being able to get to market without having to pitch 20 VCs and thus have all of your plans in the public market because we all know that word travels fast and we think in terms of being able to pull in a relatively senior team quickly. Often second-time entrepreneurs don\u2019t want to leave the option of a safe exit at a smallish valuation on the table. They\u2019ve made a bit of money, they\u2019ve had a bit of success and they really want to go big or die trying. Out of 30\u201335 investments per fund we like to fund 5\u20136 second-base entrepreneurs but mostly we believe in capital constraints as a positive force for both investor and founder. 6. Choose\u00a0wisely The obvious consideration for you when you think about how much money to raise is also from whom you will raise the money. Some funds are geared towards a wide aperture of first checks but aren\u2019t big on following on to deals that don\u2019t attract follow-ons. These funds have a view that \u201cthe market will speak\u201d and if they don\u2019t support you then something must be wrong. There are some great funds that operate this way and I see some merits. Other funds have the view that they can form conviction of whether this still represents a great investment or now irrespective of what the market says. These types of firms may see your follow-on financing as a chance to \u201cbuy up ownership.\u201d Most firms are somewhere in the middle. Knowing the style of the partnership will tell you something about what to expect if your cash starts to deplete and you\u2019re not yet ready for the next round. Importantly, within each firm different partners also have different styles and different levels of street cred in their respective firms to get deals done where the external market isn\u2019t yet ready to validate things. Knowing the style and reputation of the firm and of the partner may guide you towards the right number. If a firm is known for being supportive of initiatives that take longer, you may be willing to raise a little bit less up front. The \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d mentality still holds even if the partnership is supportive. You\u2019re always better off if you can take the next round to market because it will create price pressure that helps you get a fair valuation internally if that\u2019s the route you take. If you don\u2019t have external interest you may still get an internal round done but probably at a lower price than you otherwise may have. So there\u2019s a healthy balance between investor needs and founder needs if you keep the pressure on yourself as though you don\u2019t have a supportive internal investor. Summary There\u2019s no right answer, only trade offs. Most people opt for the \u201cmore money equals faster progress and less time fund raising\u201d mentality. Often this is a mistake and one that isn\u2019t realized for 18 months until you next need to be in market. Fund raising isn\u2019t fun. But it\u2019s an important process. It\u2019s truly a marketplace where the validity of your idea is challenged and where your progress since your last time in market is measured. Marketplaces often provide the right incentives for people to perform. Having one\u2019s feet to the fire can be painful, it also can provide inspiration and creativity. And while having more money makes today easier, having a lower valuation makes tomorrow easier. So just consider the trade-offs as you plot your journey.
