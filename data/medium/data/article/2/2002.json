In February 2015, facing rehab and the overdrawn bank account of expectation, he loses his love for football. Depressed, he takes a leave of absence from the team. Six months later, that same player beats out his old platoon mate for the starting center job and uses his Dabo Swinney impressions to became the Gorilla Glue of glue guys, helping Clemson become the first ACC school ever to rack up 4,000 passing yards and 3,000 rushing yards in the same year. All en route to the national championship game. The time in between, Guillermo spent with an ax, whittling away trees, self-doubt, and the 50 pounds he gained from drinking. Now a guy teammates describe as being \u201clike Larry the Cable Guy\u201d is the anchor of an offensive line for the nation\u2019s no. 2 preseason team and on the short list for best center in the country. He\u2019s made one big deposit into that account of expectation, and now he has a chance to make another. Ben Glicksman: Garrett finished the 2015 campaign with 19.5 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks, totals that ranked tied for eighth and tied for fifth in the nation, respectively. But that isn\u2019t why he\u2019s on this team. He\u2019s here because he looks like a cross between young Julius Peppers and Iron Man, and can do borderline impossible things like this: That highlight comes from the fine folks at Good Bull Hunting, who were able to put together a list of Garrett\u2019s top 10 plays from last season after only five games. In the clip above, Mississippi State attempts to run a speed option in which then-quarterback Dak Prescott sprints toward Garrett, conceivably eliminating him from the play, before pitching the ball to running back Aeris Williams, who then has space to roam free. Only that\u2019s not what happens. Garrett\u200a\u2014\u200awho allegedly runs a 4.45 40\u200a\u2014\u200astops for a beat, takes off to his right, and pries the ball out Williams\u2019s hand. That\u2019s more than amazing; it\u2019s damn near preposterous. Garrett is 6-foot-5, 262 pounds and the closest thing our planet has to a real-life centaur. Oh, and he loves dinosaurs. Shouts to dinosaurs. Carl Brooks Jr.: Raekwon McMillan started last season as an 18-year-old sophomore and ended as Ohio State\u2019s leading tackler and a second-team Walter Camp All American. It\u2019s hard to believe that he\u2019s still a few months short of his 20th birthday and is a co-captain of the Buckeyes and a favorite to win the Butkus Award. This year the instinctive run stopper can gain some buzz leading up to the 2017 NFL draft, where he projects as an inside linebacker. Urban Meyer Is Taking a Young Ohio State Team to the EdgeBut what happens when the Buckeyes get there?theringer.com Ryan O\u2019Hanlon: Jabrill Peppers supposedly intends to play 10 different positions over the course of this season, and we\u2019re already giving him the Heisman. That\u2019s cool. But Kordell Stewart punted the ball six times in 11 years, and Tim Tebow once nearly caught a pass with the air holes on the top of his helmet\u200a\u2014\u200aand I\u2019m pretty sure neither guy is getting his face measured by Blair Buswell any time soon. Wake me up when someone scores receiving, punt-return, kick-return, and interception-return touchdowns, wins back-to-back Pac-12 long-jump titles, almost qualifies for the Olympics, and does it all despite a near-crippling obsession with McDonald\u2019s. Just kidding. I\u2019m already awake because I\u2019ve been watching Adoree\u2019 Jackson highlights for the past 72 hours. This dude could run through a cornfield without getting touched. The best thing about college football is how volatile every play feels. In the NFL, even when someone busts a big run, it always looks like something we\u2019ve seen before; every play happens within a morass of similarly talented players running similarly shaped schemes. The outlines almost never change. In college, the players aren\u2019t as good and the formations aren\u2019t as tight, so nothing\u200a\u2014\u200aoutside of the Alabama run game\u200a\u2014\u200afeels predestined. Whenever the 20-year-old Jackson\u2019s on the field, the uncertainty meter starts to spin: In two years at USC, he\u2019s caught 37 passes for 552 yards and five touchdowns, averaged more than 5 yards per carry, posted more than 1,500 return yards and five return touchdowns, and made more than 80 tackles. He also might be the best cornerback in the country, but that\u2019s just a side note. Zach Kram: If there\u2019s a theme for this team\u200a\u2014\u200abesides players with fun nicknames\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s that it\u2019s stocked with players who can contribute on both sides of the ball. But with Myles Jack tending his knees in the pros and Shaq Thompson making Super Bowls in Carolina, we need a new two-way hero. We need Budda Baker. Baker is the standout player on an excellent defensive unit, and he\u2019s receiving preseason All-American accolades, accordingly. He also excels in big games\u200a\u2014\u200anearly half of his tackles last year were concentrated in a three-game stretch against USC, Oregon, and Stanford. But that\u2019s not why he\u2019s a Ringer Letterman. When extolling Baker\u2019s virtues for a similar project last year, Mallory Rubin noted that Baker might be \u201cprimed to see time at running back, slot receiver, and punt returner.\u201d That didn\u2019t actually happen\u200a\u2014\u200ahe didn\u2019t play an offensive snap and returned just one kickoff last season\u200a\u2014\u200abut the rumors are abounding once again. \u201cBudda was quite a playmaker with the ball in his hands in high school,\u201d Huskies coach Chris Petersen said earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he can translate that.\u201d Baker was All-State at multiple positions in high school and won a combined 13 state titles between football and track. Those abilities can probably translate to the college game. So give Budda the ball, I say. Bring \u201cBaker the Touchdown Maker\u201d rhymes to the Pacific Northwest. Tate Frazier: It is alarming to see \u201cJabrill Peppers\u201d not assigned to every single position listed in this piece. Yes\u200a\u2014\u200athat includes kicker. Peppers is above specificity, and in a word: special. So much so, he has two of the best backing him in Derek Jeter and Michael Jordan (or the brand, at least). And he is constantly fighting comparisons to his childhood icon, Charles Woodson, the last defensive player to claim the elusive Heisman Trophy in 1997. Versatility is an understatement when evaluating Peppers\u2019s positional aptitude. In 2015, he played snaps at cornerback, safety, nickelback, punt returner, kick returner, slot receiver, wide receiver, running back, and wildcat quarterback. Peppers even shouted to Harbaugh in the offseason: \u201cYour SAM linebacker\u2019s the fastest guy on the team\u201d after he won a sprint. Michigan linebackers coach Chris Partridge claims that Peppers can get to the quarterback in less than a second even if he\u2019s lined up at linebacker. Even his peers acknowledge he\u2019s just a different type of player; just straight-up cold on the field. He is a \u201cworld-class athlete\u201d according to his All-American teammate Jourdan Lewis, and he has the best hands any human being has ever seen on Instagram. Plus, we need a new Peppers in the fold. Sorry, Julius\u00a0\u2026 Give Jabrill Peppers the Heisman NowMichigan\u2019s jack-of-all-trades might play 10 different positions this year\u200a\u2014\u200acan you even name 10 positions?theringer.com Danny Chau: JK Scott looks like the kid in Boyhood if that kid grew up obsessed with Remember the Titans, but wasn\u2019t good at anything on the football field except for the literal footing of balls. So, it\u2019s a good thing he is exceptional at that. As a willowy freshman in 2014, Scott averaged exactly 48 yards per punt, tops in the nation and a figure that would have led the NFL in each of the past two seasons. He was so good, someone made a two-and-a-half minute highlight reel on YouTube dedicated to his abilities. He has the same amount of YouTube montages as Pat McAfee, who has been punting for the Colts since Scott was a teenager. JK Scott is amazing in an incredibly specific way. But he is also the folly of exponential growth, or at least the human expectation of it. (He might also be proof of it\u200a\u2014\u200aScott was 6-foot-4 when he landed in Tuscaloosa; now, as a junior, he\u2019s 6-foot-6, and might not be done growing.) The sophomore slump hit him hard; a horrid start to the 2015 season had him averaging only 39.4 yards per punt through the first five games, a rate that would have made him the 94th-best punter in the nation by average yardage at the end of the season. He rebounded well, yielding 46.7 yards per punt in the nine subsequent games in which he actually kicked. So he\u2019s fine. Or maybe he\u2019s not. Scott himself has acknowledged in interviews that growing a few inches can screw with your body\u2019s sense of itself; for a unitasker playing on college sports\u2019 foremost monolith, the calibration between the mind and the leg is the most important in the world. He claims to feel great heading into the season, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019d be able to tell the difference. Even in his untouchable freshman season, his elongated appendages give the illusion of a lack of control and precision, like he might\u2019ve missed the target. But then the ball would wobble in the air for a preposterous amount of time and bounce around the 20-yard line, and it would be perfect. Can we expect Scott to return to his near-robotic averages? Can we expect them to get even better? These are questions we\u2019re wondering about a fucking punter. That\u2019s why he\u2019s on the All-Ringer team. Mallory Rubin: Are you currently weighing whether to spend Labor Day weekend watching college football or relaxing in a body of water? Do you wish you could find a way to do both? May I recommend that you take a chlorine tablet out of UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen\u2019s holster and install a hot tub in your dorm room so that you can mix football with your aquatic exploits? Still just a sophomore, Chosen Rosen is already one of the best quarterbacks in the country. He was a top recruit, he projects as a top draft pick once eligible, and he has a chance to lead UCLA to a Pac-12 South title this season. But he\u2019s not just an arm. He\u2019s a mouth that spouts glorious quotes; fingers that post stupendous Instagrams and tweets; and a shayna punim that Jewish grandmas everywhere want to pinch. Rosen has thoughts and feelings, and he\u2019d like us all to know that. It\u2019s not just that he golfs; it\u2019s that he wears a \u201cFuck Trump\u201d hat while on the greens. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s unafraid of intimidating road environments; it\u2019s that he actively trolls hostile fan bases. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s willing to express his opinions about amateurism; it\u2019s that he drops in the #NCAA hashtag when he does so. It\u2019s rare and refreshing to get such an unfiltered glimpse into a college athlete\u2019s headspace, and all we can hope is that Rosen is less swayed by coach Jim Mora\u2019s absurd \u201cYou\u2019re heading toward Johnny Manziel\u201d bullying than by the matzo-ball fueled rush that comes from giving an interview about \u201chow Jewish Hollywood is.\u201d ", "author": "The Ringer", "parent": ""}
