If you haven\u2019t yet read Ashley C. Ford\u2019s in-depth look at Millennial women who out-earn their male partners, add it to your must-read list: Millennial Women Conflicted About Being BreadwinnersThe year I was born, 1987, women earned more money than their husbands in less than a quarter of American heterosexual\u2026www.refinery29.com There\u2019s a lot of fascinating detail in this piece, from the acknowledgement that women who earn more (and who often work longer or more stressful hours than their partners) still come home to the majority of both the emotional and household labor, to a discussion of the \u201cstay-at-home wife\u201d as status symbol (and the \u201cstay-at-home husband\u201d as\u2026 anti-status symbol). However, Ford notes that the conflict in this case isn\u2019t necessarily about money: Like most relationships, the real problems are expectations and communication. The women most frustrated by their breadwinner status never considered it could happen, didn\u2019t expect it to last, or can\u2019t find a way to do things differently even when they want to. One woman describes her household situation\u2014and her assumptions about her partner\u2019s feelings\u2014in a way that practically screams what she cannot say: When asked how he felt about her out-earning him, she admitted that it bothers him, \u201cbut not enough to go out and take a full time job he thinks is beneath him.\u201d But this isn\u2019t just a story about women who might resent their underemployed partners. Ford also profiles couples who are comfortable with their financial situation, despite the income disparity\u2014including her own relationship. The piece also includes actual income numbers, for those of us who are curious whether earning \u201cenough\u201d solves at least some of the resentment, no matter who earns it. So give it a read, if you haven\u2019t already, and let us know what you think.
