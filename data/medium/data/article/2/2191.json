For example, if you want to message me on Mastodon, you have to type @qinaliu@mastodon.social in a toot (more on this later). Since each user is tied to an instance, people can also steal your username and identity on another instance (it\u2019s sort of like how email addresses at @gmail.com and @yahoo.com and @aol.com are all different). And since you can join and log into as many Mastodon instances as you\u2019d like, you can technically be in multiple places at the same time. How Mastodon compares to\u00a0Twitter: Mastodon, while prehistoric in some regards (the timeline is thankfully still chronological and you \u201cFavourite\u201d rather than \u201cLike\u201d posts here), feels intuitive since it resembles Twitter so much. The interface looks like TweetDeck\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept the columns aren\u2019t customizable, you can\u2019t schedule posts, you can\u2019t build lists, trends are harder to track or search, and well, Mastodon isn\u2019t Twitter. On Mastodon: But those are some of the more obvious differences. Mastodon.social is built as a \u201cTwitter user\u2019s utopia\u201d: one where advertising, racism and hate speech is strictly prohibited and equality is key. To limit potential harassment, Mastodon is only searchable by hashtags (this might change in the future) and you can\u2019t \u201cquote-toot.\u201d Mastodon also features customizable privacy filters for each toot. Additionally, Rochko also introduced a content warning filter\u2026 \u2026which users have used to hide punchlines to jokes: Another major difference is how toots are received. Since the number of replies, boosts and favourites on a toot are hidden until you click on a toot, it\u2019s not as important for a toot to get boosted or favourited. Since timelines are in chronological order rather than the algorithmic one Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have adopted, every toot also has an equal shot of being seen. The point of all this isn\u2019t to collect likes or follows, but perhaps so people might actually have conversations. But if a part of you gets joy from building a following, know that your follower count looks different depending on which instance someone\u2019s on. Unlike Twitter, Mastodon also doesn\u2019t suggest people you should follow anymore (although that was a feature when the social network first launched). You find people by seeing what they\u2019re tooting. And you click on toots to see threads of conversations. The difference between a local timeline and a federated timeline Mastodon gives you the option to toggle between your local and federated timelines. Toots from your instance appear in chronological order in your local timeline while toots from accounts people in your instance follow might appear in the federated timeline. Getting people to show up in your federated timelines takes a bit of exploration and world building. As accounts in your instance follow more people from other instances, the more accounts can potentially show up in your instance\u2019s federated timeline. There\u2019s a bunch of Followbots that seemed to have been created for the purpose of globalization and connecting people across instances. This means that depending on what instance you\u2019re on, your local and federated timelines could look completely different as someone else\u2019s on another Mastodon instance. But if you still don\u2019t get it, here\u2019s another explanation of local and federated timelines: Who should I follow on Mastodon? While the local and federated timelines can help you find accounts that might be interesting to follow, Mastodon isn\u2019t as fun until you follow some accounts. Like Twitter, you can curate your \u201cHome\u201d timeline, but unlike Twitter, it\u2019s harder to search for people to follow unless you know their Mastodon handle. I\u2019m at @qinaliu@mastodon.social if you want to give me a follow, but here\u2019s a list of other journalists and influencers: Someone also started a public Google Doc database for artists, musicians and filmmakers on Mastodon: Mastodon Creatives / Artists / Musicians / Illustrators / Animators / FilmmakersSheet1 Handle, Interests, Notes/ URLs/ etc., Birdsite/ other handle @ pseudomichael@ mastodon. network, motion graphics\u2026docs.google.com How to get \u201cverified\u201d on\u00a0Mastodon Let\u2019s be honest: you just want to get one of those check marks \u2705 next to your name. It\u2019s super easy to do on Mastodon and it\u2019s not just limited to celebrities, journalists and other influencers like on Twitter. All you really have to do is insert a check emoji next to your display name. Mastodon users use the \u2705 to poke fun at the complicated verification process on Twitter. In addition to fake Twitter accounts on Mastodon, there\u2019s a bunch of Mastodon accounts that poke fun of the Twitter verification process: I\u2019ve even seen some users upload the Twitter egg as their avatars. What do people talk about on Mastodon? It\u2019s like Fight Club in that the first rule of Fight Club is that you don\u2019t talk about Fight Club outside of Fight Club. Since cross-posting from Mastodon to Twitter doesn\u2019t work and posting about Mastodon on Twitter might be frowned upon, what do Mastodon users talk about on Mastodon? Mastodon, of course! #Mastodon is consistently the \u21161 hashtag people used, according to a Trendbot that tracks trending hashtags. Cats are also popular. (This is the Internet, after all.) But if you\u2019re new, searching the hashtag #introduction or #introductions is a good place to search and toot to find other people with similar interests who might be worth following. So should I use hashtags on Mastodon? It depends. Words in toots aren\u2019t searchable yet, but hashtags are. Using hashtags with words helps your toots become more searchable and it might help you connect with someone with common interests. But if you don\u2019t want potential trolls to find something by keyword, don\u2019t use a hashtag. Is there an app for\u00a0that? Of course! There\u2019s an app for everything. I haven\u2019t tried them all, but here\u2019s a good list of apps for iOS, Android and Chrome: tootsuite/mastodonmastodon - A GNU Social-compatible microblogging servergithub.com Tusky for Android and Amaroq on iOS seem to be the most popular ones recommended. Why am I seeing pineapples all over Mastodon? Alright, so I\u2019m no P.J. Vogt, Alex Goldman or any of the other awesome producers at the podcast \u201cReply All,\u201d but I\u2019m going to attempt to \u201cYes, Yes, No\u201d this for you guys. \ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d on Mastodon got started by Alex Weiner (@acw@mastodon.social), a software developer who uses APL. Since APL sounds like \ud83c\udf4e, he really likes \ud83c\udf4e and any words including \ud83c\udf4e like \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf4e. So he started tooting \ud83c\udf4d to new people as a form of \u201chello,\u201d \u201cwelcome,\u201d \u201caloha\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aand you get the idea. And he also started boosting toots with \ud83c\udf4d. So \ud83c\udf4d became the emoji shorthand for boost. And \ud83c\udf4ding also became Internet slang for when your Mastodon follower count surpasses your Twitter follower count. But pineapple appreciation didn\u2019t end there. Other people started posting \ud83c\udf4d in their display name. And even Rochko made a pineapple joke. So to recap, if you get a \ud83c\udf4d on Mastodon, it\u2019s\u2026 Plus, pineapples are awesome. Except if you\u2019re the president of Iceland, who doesn\u2019t like \ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf55.
