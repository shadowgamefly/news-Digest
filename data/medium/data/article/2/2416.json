There is much talk these days that startup valuations have decreased and may continue to do so and that the amount of time it takes to fund raise may take longer. As I have pointed out in previous posts, 91% of VCs surveyed believe prices are declining (30% believe substantially) and 77% believe that funding will take longer than it has in the past. This has led VC & entrepreneur bloggers alike to similar conclusions: start raising capital early and be careful about having too high of a burn rate because that lessens the amount of runway you have until you need more cash. But the hardest question to actually answer is, \u201cWhat is the right burn rate for your company?\u201d and if anybody gives you a specific number I would be a bit skeptical because there is no universal answer. It\u2019s a very personal topic and I\u2019d like to offer you a framework to decide for yourself, based on the following factors: How Long is it Taking to Raise Capital at Your Stage in the Market?The earlier the round, the less capital you need and the more reasonable your valuation the less time that is needed generally to raise capital. In other words, raising $2 million at a $6 million pre-money valuation has always been easier & quicker than raising $20 million at any valuation. I know it sounds obvious but just so you understand: There are more capital sources available for earlier-stage capital, the information on which they are evaluating the investment is less (it is almost certainly just team and product) and the risk of the investor getting things wrong is diminished. When you raise larger rounds there is more \u201cdue diligence,\u201d which includes: calling customers, looking at financial metrics, doing cohort analysis (looking for trends like changes in churn rates), evaluating competitor positioning and understanding more of the competency of your executive team. While there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d I used to give the advice that you should plan about 4.5 months for fund raising start to finish and make sure you have at least 6 months of cash if it takes longer. In recent years it seems many deals got done in 2\u20133 months or shorter and that still may be true at the earliest stages. My advice: be cautious, start early, get to know investors before you need capital, do your research on who is a likely good fit and understand that fund-raising is always part of your job\u200a\u2014\u200anot something you do in \u201cfund-raising season\u201d for 2\u20133 months every other year. People who think of fund raising as a \u201cdistraction away from the core business\u201d fundamentally don\u2019t understand that running a business comprises of: Shipping products, selling to & servicing customers, marketing, HR, recruiting, financial reporting AND making sure you have enough money to support operations. In other words, fund-raising is a permanent part of the job of the CEO (and CFO) of a company so whether you allocate 5% of your time to it or 20%\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a year-round activity even if just in the background. When you ask yourself how Uber became the powerhouse it is\u200a\u2014\u200ain addition to great software & operations and the right innovation at the right time\u200a\u2014\u200ait was also the fact that they knew how to constantly tap the capital markets to grow the business, making it harder for many competitors to do so. Who are Your Existing Investors?How much your company should burn should also have a direct correlation with who your existing investors are and I strongly advise that you have open conversations with them about their comfort levels and also the level of support you are likely to receive going forward. I\u2019m surprised how few entrepreneurs have this open conversation with their investors. In fact, most entrepreneurs I know don\u2019t ask\u200a\u2014\u200awhy is that? Wouldn\u2019t you rather know where you stand? There are ways to do this politely and even if your investors don\u2019t answer as directly as you may like\u200a\u2014\u200athere is at least something that can be read into this. So. If you have a strong lead investor known for backing his or her entrepreneurs in tough times and that investor gives you a sense for her comfort level in writing your next check then you can have a higher burn rate than if you don\u2019t feel you have a strong lead investor. If you have mostly angels or don\u2019t feel your existing investor can support you without new capital from the outside then you might want a smaller burn rate. Remember those party rounds that became so popular over the past few years because they allowed higher prices and more favorable terms for entrepreneurs? Well if you took that option I would simply advise that you be a little bit more cautious with your burn rate. Here\u2019s why: If you have 5 firms who each gave you $500k you have 3 distinct problems: Are Your Existing Investors Over Their Skis?This is another thing I strongly advise entrepreneurs to understand and even talk with their VCs about. Let me play open book so you can understand the situation better. At Upfront Ventures 90% of the first-check investments we do are seed or A-round (and 2/3rd of these are A-rounds) with about 10% of our first-checks (in number) being B-rounds. As a primarily A-round investor with a nearly $300 million fund our average first-check size is about $3.5 million. We invest about half of our fund in our initial investments and we \u201creserve\u201d about 50% of our investments to follow on in our best deals. Obviously if a company is doing phenomenally well we\u2019ll try to invest more capital and if a company is taking time to mature we\u2019ll be more cautious. But even companies that take time to mature will usually get at least a second check of support from us as long as they are showing strong signs of innovating and as long as we believe they are still committed to the long-term viability of the business and as long as they show financial prudence. In our best deals we hope to invest $10\u201315 million over the life of the fund. So if we\u2019ve invested $3\u20134 million in your company there is a strong chance you will get some level of support from us because on a relative basis we are not \u201cover committed\u201d and even in tough times for you, allocating $1\u20132 million is part of our scope and strategy to get you through unforeseen situations. If on the other hand we have committed $10 million and if you don\u2019t have 3 other investors around the table and if you\u2019re burning $800k / month (implying you need $10 million more to fund one-year\u2019s operations or nearly $15 million to fund 18 months)\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re simply \u201cover our skis\u201d in order to help you because we wouldn\u2019t put $25 million in one company at our size fund. So even if we LOVE your business you are stretching our ability to fund you in tough times. You ought to have a sense for your existing investors\u2019 capacities relative to your company. How Strong is Your Access to Capital?Talking about existing investors is one way of talking about \u201caccess to capital\u201d because if you already have VCs then you have \u201caccess.\u201d And then you\u2019re just assessing whether you can get access to new VCs or whether your existing VCs can help you in tough times. I talk about \u201caccess to capital\u201d in the context of fund raising because it is the biggest determinant of your likelihood of raising. If you went to Stanford with a bunch of VCs who you count as friends (and who respect you) plus you worked at the senior ranks of Facebook, Salesforce.com, Palantir or Uber\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have very strong access\u200a\u2014\u200aobviously. But many people aren\u2019t in this situation. If your company has raised angel money and maybe some capital from seed funds that are less well known or are new\u200a\u2014\u200athen your access to capital may be less strong. What is Your Risk Appetite?It is also impossible to tell you the right burn rate for your company without knowing your risk tolerance. Quite simply\u200a\u2014\u200asome people would rather \u201cgo hard\u201d and accept the consequence of failure if they don\u2019t succeed. Other people are more cautious and have a lot more at stake if the company doesn\u2019t succeed (like maybe they put in their own money or their family\u2019s money). So whenever people ask me for advice I normally start by asking: There is no right answer. Only you can know. But check your risk tolerance. Again, I know this sounds very obvious but in practice it isn\u2019t always. Some companies may be able to become \u201ccockroaches\u201d or \u201cramen profitable\u201d but cutting costs and staff substantially and getting to a burn rate that last 2 years. But that could impact the future upside of the company. So you might have a company that is \u201cmedium valuable\u201d in the long-run because with no capital it was hard to innovate and create a market leader. That\u2019s ok for some entrepreneurs (and investor) and not for others. Also. You may think that it\u2019s ok to \u201ccut to the bone\u201d but you may find out that your team didn\u2019t want to join that sort of company so you may cut back really far only to find that the remaining people leave. Simply put\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019re going to cut to the bone make sure that the team you intend to keep is aligned culturally with this decision. Being ramen profitable is the right decision for some team and the wrong decision for others. Only you know. Keep your burn rate in line with your: Access to capital & risk tolerance levels. How Reasonable Was Your Last Valuation?There are two other factors you may consider. One is how reasonable your last round valuation was. If you raised $10 million at a $40 million pre-money on a company with limited revenue and if your investors are telling you that they\u2019re concerned about your future because they doubt that outsiders will fund you at your current performance level then I would be more cautious with my burn rate\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it means slashing costs. There are only four solutions to this problem: How Complicated is Your Cap Table?Cap Table issues are seldom understood by entrepreneurs. Again, my best advice is to talk with your VCs openly or at least the ones you trust the most to be open. If you raised a $2 million seed round at a $6 million pre then a $5 million A-round at a $20 million pre then a $20 million B-round at a $80 million pre and if your company has stalled you may have a cap table problem. Let me explain. The $20 million investor may now believe that you\u2019re never going to be worth $300 million or more (they invested hoping for no less than a 3x). So if they\u2019re in the mindset that they\u2019re better off getting their $20 million back versus risking more capital then they may prefer just to sell your company for whatever you can get for it. Even if you sold for $20 million they\u2019d be thinking \u201cI have senior liquidation preference so I get my money back.\u201d) The early stage investor probably still owns 15% of your company and thought he or she had a great return coming (after all\u200a\u2014\u200ait got marked up to $100 million post-money valuation just 12 months ago!). But they are \u201cover their skis\u201d on ability to help you because they\u2019re an early-stage investor so they\u2019re dependent on your B-round investor or outside money. They don\u2019t want you to sell for $20 million because they may still believe in you AND they know that they\u2019ll get no return from this (and your personal return will be very small). You are in a classic cap table pinch. You don\u2019t even realize that the later-stage investor doesn\u2019t support you any more. Solution: For starters get your seed & A investors helping. They may be able to persuade your B-round investor to be more reasonable. They may push you to cut costs. They may suggest cap table adjustments as a compromise. Or they may ferret out that your B-round investor just won\u2019t budge. But at least you\u2019ll know where you stand before deciding what to do about burn. Note that I\u2019m not making any value judgments about seed, A or B (or C or growth) investors. Just trying to point out that at times they\u2019re not always aligned and most entrepreneurs don\u2019t understand this math. More ReadingIf you want to read more on the burn rate topic I\u2019ve written about it before. I also wrote this primer that is more how to find, target and close VC investment. Appendix:As with yesterday I\u2019m still at a soccer tournament with my son (he\u2019s asleep\u200a\u2014\u200abut we made the championship round!). So I have no time to edit or word check. I hope this post is at least helpful for those surveying what to do about burn rates and the market. And if I made mistakes or typos feel free to let me know and I\u2019ll fix tomorrow.
