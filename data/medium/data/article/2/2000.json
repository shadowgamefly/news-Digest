The consensus no. 1 recruit in the class of 2014, he looked like a man among boys from the moment he stepped on the field as a true freshman. Even at 18 years old, Fournette produced highlights reminiscent of this clip of the Indianapolis Colts mascot playing against a group of kindergartners."}, {"5783": "The same qualities that made Fournette the most promising high school player in a generation and someone who rushed for 1,953 yards during his sophomore season at LSU are now lifting him into top-10 pick consideration. He bowls over defenders at 6-foot-1 and 240 pounds; trying to tackle Fournette is like trying to drag down a bad-intentioned kitchen appliance that can run the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds."}, {"c718": "That top-end burst is what makes Fournette such a coveted prospect in the eyes of many around the league. And while a massive back who treats safeties like speed bumps is undeniably entertaining, Fournette\u2019s appeal transcends that: He combines his physicality with enough acceleration to gash opponents at every turn. He doesn\u2019t need more than a sliver of daylight before he\u2019s standing in the end zone as an entire defense wonders what the hell just happened."}, {"a11e": "Fournette\u2019s big flaw is that he could be better at finding those slivers and creating for himself. His ability to power through holes may be his best trait, but he\u2019s rarely able to manufacture an opening. It\u2019s also unlikely that he will ever become an above-average receiver, a premier blocking back in pass protection (his effort and technique are both wanting), or a runner who thrives on vision and helps set up blocking schemes. By hammering defenders and taking advantage of his rare combination of physical traits, though, he may still be able to elevate a team\u2019s ground game all by himself."}, {"62cd": "There aren\u2019t many 240-pound backs making an impact in the modern NFL.

The former Seminoles star has a rare gift for setting up both blockers and defenders with where he\u2019s going and how fast he\u2019s getting there."}, {"75b4": "Many of the top runners in the league, like Pittsburgh\u2019s Le\u2019Veon Bell and Buffalo\u2019s LeSean McCoy, understand the way their movements affect a defense to the point that they sometimes give off the impression they can see into the future. Exploiting cutback lanes and openings that didn\u2019t exist a second earlier often gets described as vision, but Cook doesn\u2019t have to see a crease to know where one will appear."}, {"44a3": "Cook\u2019s effectiveness in that regard is enhanced by his ability to slow down or speed up in an instant. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to get going after coming to a halt, and that makes it easy for him to manipulate defenders into playing at his tempo."}, {"6ce7": "As a receiver, Cook should be able to contribute to most schemes right away. He\u2019ll let the occasional pass hit the ground, and there are moments that he struggles in pass protection when matched up against larger rushers. But both of those issues seem to stem from mental lapses rather than a lack of ability. Of greater concern is Cook\u2019s tendency to fumble; he had 13 over his three seasons at Florida State, including six during the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s a habit that any team thinking about making Cook the focal point of its offense will have to discuss in detail."}, {"f437": "Cook did himself no favors at the combine, finishing in the single-digit percentiles among running backs in the three-cone drill (seventh) and 20-yard shuttle (sixth). Neither mark indicates much change-of-direction prowess from a non-power back who weighed in at 210 pounds. And even his solid 40-yard dash time (4.49 seconds) is slower than his play speed."}, {"f132": "Chart via Mockdraftable.com"}, {"d12c": "His tape, though, should quell most front-office hesitations.

How high a team takes him and how he\u2019s eventually used are two of the most interesting questions in this draft. A huge chunk of his production at Stanford came on the ground (including 1,603 of his 1,913 yards from scrimmage as a junior), but his frame and style of play both raise concerns about his viability as a traditional runner at the next level."}, {"3004": "At 202 pounds, McCaffrey is on the small side for a running back. That\u2019s exacerbated by the fact that he stands 5-foot-11, while many of the league\u2019s other small, effective runners (such as Dion Lewis, Gio Bernard, and Danny Woodhead) pack roughly the same amount of bulk onto considerably shorter frames. Even in college, McCaffrey\u2019s lack of power as a rusher was evident. He isn\u2019t going to shed many tackles, and his usefulness in tighter spaces can be limited. He had enough vision to consistently hit big runs in college, but as the lanes become smaller in the NFL, he may have trouble emerging as a reliable early-down option."}, {"d95c": "It\u2019s what he can do on passing downs, though, that makes him an enticing option toward the back of the first round. As a receiving target, McCaffrey should be able to step onto the field and contribute immediately. He catches the ball with ease and is supremely gifted as a route runner. Stanford deployed him in a variety of ways, and McCaffrey looked comfortable doing every one. Whether he was cooking a defensive back on a double move or slicing up a linebacker on an option route, he proved dynamic; creative play designers can and should salivate over his versatility."}, {"a23e": "As the NFL grows increasingly pass-happy, teams are relying on shotgun formations, sub packages, and personnel mismatches more than ever before. That makes backs with McCaffrey\u2019s skill set exceedingly valuable. Even if his appeal is primarily tied to the passing game, McCaffrey is a surefire playmaker. He can be used as a runner in certain formations and as a wideout who can pick apart coverage in others."}, {"c611": "A Four-Step Guide to Watching Football Like a ScoutAhead of April\u2019s NFL draft, how do you separate the hundreds of prospects from each other?

He had a limited workload during the last two seasons at Tennessee (210 total rushes and only five games in which he racked up 15-plus carries), yet he made an impression with his touches.
