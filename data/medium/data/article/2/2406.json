Machine Learning /\u00a0AI They discussed many topics ranging from protection of the press to what Mark looks for in an entrepreneur to investing outside of Silicon Valley and of course Trump and sports. But perhaps to most insightful was their discussion about Machine Learning / AI. Mark made a fortune by being early in Local Area Networking, streaming and then High Definition video so perhaps it\u2019s worth listening. He said that he believes AI will have a bigger impact than any technology in the last 30 years. \u201cArtificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever you\u2019re doing if you don\u2019t understand it\u200a\u2014\u200alearn it. Because otherwise you\u2019re going to be a dinosaur within 3\u00a0years.\u201d Mark also said that what happens in the next 5\u201310 years is just going to blow everybody away, especially in the field of automation. He thinks even programming is vulnerable to being automated and reducing the number of available programming jobs. Startups Outside Silicon\u00a0Valley Jason asked Mark is he thought it was possible to build non-Silicon Valley successful startups. Mark said that the beauty of Silicon Valley isn\u2019t the money available for financing it\u2019s the money available for exits. Part of the problem is that companies don\u2019t go public any more. If more companies outside Silicon Valley went public that would shift the balance of power. 20 years ago there were 9,000 public companies. Now there are 4,000. There\u2019s a ton of capital only available for people who go public so people not going public is myopic. And he believes with less companies going public there is less competition. He said if Instagram went public. Or Oculus or twitch went public there would be more competition and he believes that as a country this isn\u2019t good for us. If more companies around the country went public it would create more ecosystems because any time there are smart people gathered money will find them and fund them\u200a\u2014\u200abut there need to be exits. Mark also pointed out that the number of investments he personally makes in San Francisco has dropped by 90%. Here is the full YouTube interview. Great Entrepreneurs Jason: What do you look for when you\u2019re looking at an entrepreneur? Mark: smart, continuous learning (90% of Mark\u2019s reading now is about neural networks, machine learning\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s where everything is going), put in the time to execute, willing to sell, care about making a profit\u200a\u2014\u200aat some point you have to make money. All of the investments he\u2019s making are related to the artificial intelligence world. Greatest Public\u00a0Startups Jason: You are still an investor in Netflix, right? Mark: My two biggest holdings are Netflix and Amazon. They are the two best startups in the industry with Google and Facebook being good companies behind them. Protecting Freedom of the\u00a0Press Jason: The documentary at the Sundance film festival about Gawker (Nobody Speak) convinced me that although I didn\u2019t like Gawker this really was a 1st amendment issue and it scares me about protecting the Fourth Estate (an independent press). How are we going to protect the Fourth Estate? Mark: The media industry needs to just do what it does. Four years will go fast. But NY Times, WaPo & CNN can\u2019t get caught up in just trying to make Trump or make Trump followers happy. Politics. Jason: Do you meet with the President if he calls? Mark: Look, when you sit down with Trump or speak 1\u20131 on the phone, he\u2019s personable. He\u2019s nice. And you think, ok, this guys alright. And then for whatever reason when you walk out the room he\u2019s Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde. We all fall into the same trap, we roll our eyes at what he says and then think we\u2019re going to use logic to convince his supporters to change their minds\u200a\u2014\u200ait doesn\u2019t work. [Suster side note\u200a\u2014\u200aread this powerful book The Righteous Mind if you want to understand why logic doesn\u2019t work to persuade voters\u200a\u2014\u200amost important post-election book I\u2019ve read.] Mark: 23% of eligible voters voted for Trump. 25% of eligible voters voted against him. 52% didn\u2019t vote. We\u200a\u2014\u200aand the media\u200a\u2014\u200ashould only focus on the undecided. Only 9% of American adults get news from Twitter so we aren\u2019t getting the news from his Tweets, we\u2019re getting news from how the media covers his Tweets. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t going to change. But what\u2019s critically important is how we respond. Demonstrations, yes, but they have to be peaceful. They have to be\u00a0civil.\u201d But it is hard to be patient when he\u2019s such an idiot. And we have a president that\u2019s never sent an email in his life. Combatting Online\u00a0Trolls Dick Costolo thought during his tenure he didn\u2019t do enough to combat trolls. You have mentioned you have an idea how to combat things. What is it? Mark: If I Tweet and somebody responds to my Tweet and trolls me\u200a\u2014\u200aI should have the ability to kick them out of the thread. Trollers don\u2019t troll because they want to say something, they troll because they want somebody to notice them. I\u2019d like to exclude them from this thread or permanently. Or I should be able to Tweet and say that nobody can comment on this Tweet. Or I should be able to reply but have my reply be private. In fact, we\u2019re building an app to do just this. Sports A final 5+ minutes talked about sports. Mostly about how the NFL is a problem sport due to concussions and injuries. But if you\u2019re a sports or Cuban fan you\u2019ll want to listen to this bit, too. Suster Sidenote There were many famous speakers and attendees at the Upfront Summit but I was given a very strict assignment by my two boys (11 & 13)\u200a\u2014\u200athe only thing they cared about was that I got a photo with Mark Cuban. They are huge fans of Shark Tank. Often my sons are in the car when I\u2019m talking with entrepreneurs or my partners about deals. After years of watching Shark Tank it\u2019s heartening to hear them make comments like, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he gave up so much equity? Why didn\u2019t he just do a licensing deal?\u201d Ha. Gotta love great role models. So here ya go, boys.
