The Gall-Peters map, in particular, has an interesting history. It was originally presented at a scientific convention in 1855 by John Gall, an English astronomer. Despite a lackluster reception at the convention, Gall published a paper on the map 30 years later, in 1885. It did not gain much support from scientists, navigators or cartographers at the time, because when maps were primarily used for navigation there was no need for such a distorted map. Over 100 years later, in the 1970s, German activist and historian Arno Peters brought it back to life. Peters believed he had created a completely new way to look at the world, but cartographers recognized it as incredibly similar to the Gall map.

After all, in the Mercator projection the poles and equator are distorted so that equatorial areas appear much smaller than they are in real life, and the poles are presented as much bigger. This is because the Mercator map was created for navigation, and by preserving shape over area, travel routes could be planned easily and accurately from thousands of miles away.

The Winkel Tripel is a very common projection, where both shape and scale are considered and adjusted to produce a reasonable map.

Of course, the Mercator is still incredibly common. It\u2019s the map we see most frequently.
