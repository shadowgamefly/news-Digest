One play in particular stood out to me during the Orange Bowl game. Lined up at RDE, Charlton reads run away as his offensive tackle blocks down. He squeezes down the gap as defensive ends are taught to do, and as soon as he sees a tight end working across the formation, behind the line of scrimmage, Charlton diagnoses play action pass. In a seemingly effortless motion, he drops his hips and takes off sprinting after the QB, closing the 7-yard distance between the two in a hurry, forcing the QB to throw the ball into the dirt.
