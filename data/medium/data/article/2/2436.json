But how do you find legit masters degree programs in a sea of mediocre programs and outright scams? By going straight to some of the best universities on the planet. These online master\u2019s degrees can be much less expensive than in-person masters, and offer considerable flexibility\u200a\u2014\u200ayou don\u2019t have to report to a campus, and you can watch the lectures and do the assignments at your convenience. Top universities have collaborated with Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers to launch their online master\u2019s degree. The first MOOC-based degree was announced back in 2013. It took two years for the next one to be announced in 2015. But in the last year or so, MOOC providers have announced seven more completely-online master\u2019s degrees. In fact, Coursera plans to offer 20 such degrees by the end of 2019. The advantage of MOOC-based master\u2019s degrees is that many courses that are part of the degree are completely free to take. So you can preview a part of the content before committing to anything. Also, all of these degrees are based on the pay-as-you-go model. You only pay for the courses that you\u2019re currently taking. Some also have the option to earn partial academic credits. One thing to be aware is that each degree has its own application process (and deadlines), as well as minimum requirements like a bachelor\u2019s degree or minimum work experience. Many require you to submit different standardized test scores, like the GRE, GMAT, or TOEFL. If you\u2019re not interested in a formal credential and just want to learn, check out Class Central for over 7,000 MOOCs taught by 700+ universities around the world. Without further delay, here are nine completely online master\u2019s degrees that have been announced so far. 1. Georgia Tech and Udacity: Online Master of Science in Computer Science\u00a0(OMSCS) Announced Back in 2013, Udacity and Georgia Tech\u2019s completely online Masters in Computer Science was the first degree announced by a MOOC provider. The entire degree was going to cost less than $7,000. The tuition fee has since then increased from $402 per three-credit hour to $510. Zvi Galil, Dean of Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Computing, speaking to OMSCS students at an event (which I got to attend) organized by Udacity at\u00a0SXSWedu. Things were really slow at the beginning. It took two years before the first batch of eighteen students graduated in December 2015. A year later, in December 2016, around 200 students had graduated. But the OMSCS is gaining momentum. There are now over 4,500 students enrolled in the spring 2017 semester. You can find more details here: https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/ 2.

Three of Georgia Tech\u2019s OMS Analytics foundational courses will form the Analytics: Essential Tools and Methods MicroMasters credential program on edx.org.
