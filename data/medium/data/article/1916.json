But believe it or not, the franchise\u2019s love affair with Corona is not product placement\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s character development at its weirdest, and most American. For more than a decade and a half, the Fast & Furious franchise has ripped, roared, and pressed every last NOS button on its way to action-franchise preeminence. To mark the release of The Fate of the Furious, the series\u2019 eighth installment, we\u2019re declaring it Fast 8 Week. Please join us in living life one quarter-mile at a time. Dominic Toretto, the hulking, hairless patriarch of 2001\u2019s The Fast and the Furious, is upset. Also tired. A routine night of underground racing in East L.A. has just turned into a police raid; Dom managed an on-foot escape, but he and his new friend Brian Spilner, a mysterious rookie in the racing scene, were quickly intercepted by Dom\u2019s rival Johnny Tran and had to stand idly by as a hail of gunfire and NOS turned Brian\u2019s Mitsubishi Eclipse into a green-orange ball of fire. After finally making it back to his house\u200a\u2014\u200aa refuge for outcasts and car-and-leather-obsessed tweakers\u200a\u2014\u200aDom is chagrined to find his crew having a party. At the moment, the only person on Dom\u2019s good side is Brian. Determined to reward Brian further, Dom picks up two stray beer bottles and approaches him. That\u2019s when he says it: \u201cYou can have any brew you want\u00a0\u2026 as long as it\u2019s a Corona.\u201d Fourteen years later, and 30 minutes into Furious 7, Dom is fighting Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) to the death when they\u2019re interrupted by a man who refers to himself as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell). Shaw escapes, and Dom is forced to follow Nobody back to his super-secret lair in El Segundo, California, where, amid barrels of explosives and camo-colored trunks, there sits a kegerator. \u201cBelgian ale,\u201d Mr. Nobody says, taking a sip out of a freshly poured pint glass. \u201cOh man, those monks got it right. Would you like one?\u201d And then Dom says it: \u201cI\u2019m more of a Corona man myself.\u201d Unfazed, Nobody reaches behind a trunk and produces a Corona-branded bucket of Coronas and slaps it down on a table in all its frosty, ice-cold glory. The Definitive \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 Movie RankingsBefore \u2018Fate of the Furious\u2019 is released, Shea Serrano and Andrew Gruttadaro are taking stock: Which is the best \u2018Fast\u2026theringer.com The Fast & Furious franchise became what it is today\u200a\u2014\u200aa billion-dollar box-office juggernaut, with seven sequels and at least two more to come\u200a\u2014\u200ain part because the movies embraced their absurdity. They drive cars through skyscrapers, make 100-foot leaps into ravines, and drive bank vaults through Rio, stripping themselves of all self-seriousness and adherence to the laws of physics. But beneath the nonsensical stunts and the utter disappearance of the threat of death, when everything gets boiled down, the Fast movies remain focused on a family of misfit thrill-seekers who sit around a table drinking beer\u200a\u2014\u200aalmost always Corona\u200a\u2014\u200atogether well after the sun goes down. That truth layers emotion behind every stunt and every illogical plot development and engenders loyalty from the audience. More than any of the cars Dom, Brian, and their crew have driven or destroyed in seven movies\u200a\u2014\u200amore than the cities they\u2019ve dragged through, more than Eva Mendes or Lucas Black\u200a\u2014\u200aCorona has been a unifying symbol in the Fast & Furious franchise. Since Vin Diesel\u2019s reading of that now-iconic line, at once nonsensical and definitive, the beer brand has acted as a signifier of time and place, and now, as Fast approaches its eighth film, a tool for self-reference and awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a character in the films,\u201d says Chris Morgan, who\u2019s written the screenplay for every Fast movie since the third, Tokyo Drift. It\u2019s what Reese\u2019s Pieces was to ET\u200a\u2014\u200aif ET had seven sequels and counting. \u2018The Fast and the Furious,\u2019 2001 (Universal Pictures) But the history of Corona and Fast & Furious isn\u2019t a story about a winking, fruitful, long-running product-placement deal, or even some byzantine corporate favor for two closely aligned conglomerates. There are likely hundreds of corporations who would shell out to be repeatedly endorsed by a multibillion-dollar franchise; to pick a close example, Heineken reportedly paid $45 million to make James Bond a beer drinker in Skyfall. But, believe it or not, Universal is featuring Corona for free. According to the franchise\u2019s creators, Corona\u2019s product just so happened to represent exactly what Fast & Furious was looking for when the saga began\u200a\u2014\u200aand 16 years later, it\u2019s what Corona represents, and the character continuity it provides, they say, that matters. As consumers, the things we buy are shorthand\u200a\u2014\u200aconsciously and subconsciously\u200a\u2014\u200afor who we are and, just as importantly, who we think other people are. It\u2019s for that reason that some products become character notes and reference points all on their own. Think Tiffany & Co. in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s or Alaia in Clueless, or more recently Eggo in Stranger Things. But there\u2019s a fine line between overt mentions of a product and all-out pandering. Mike Myers poked fun at how movies sell out for products in Wayne\u2019s World, imitating their transparent greediness while smizing over an open box of Pizza Hut. As the boardroom deals between production companies and brands began to manifest in increasingly obvious ways on screen (and haven\u2019t slowed down since 1992, the year Wayne\u2019s World came out), audiences reprogrammed themselves to balk at product placement and be skeptical of any art that appears to be selling out. The funny, and quite frankly weird, thing about Fast & Furious is that it seems like one of these sellouts, when actually, it\u2019s not like that at all. We Wrote the Next Four \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 MoviesHere\u2019s how Vin Diesel, the Rock, and the rest of the gang will get to space, survive the apocalypse, and resurrect the\u2026theringer.com Corona gained popularity in the 1980s, bursting onto the scene at a time when Americans were moving toward lighter-tasting beers and starting to buy more imported products. \u201cIt emanated out of California,\u201d says Benj Steinman, longtime president of Beer Marketer\u2019s Insights. \u201cVacation in a bottle\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s iconic at this point.\u201d It\u2019s that fact that drew Gary Scott Thompson to Corona when he was working on the script for what would become 2001\u2019s The Fast and the Furious. \u201cI was asked by Universal to see if I could figure out a story based on a Vibe magazine article that they had. Ironically, I lived a block from a group of kids who were tearing their cars apart and putting them back together,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cI had Corona in my script because the guys at the end of the street drank Corona. It was a very East L.A. beer.\u201d \u2018The Fast and the Furious,\u2019 2001 (Universal Pictures) \u201cI was trying to make an L.A. saga,\u201d says Rob Cohen, who developed and directed The Fast and the Furious, \u201cand Corona, to me, just seemed like this iconic, Southern California beer.\u201d It also helped that Corona, a beer with significant contingents of Hispanic and Asian consumers, had a base that reflected the kind of cast Cohen was trying to build. \u201c[When] I went to a street race for the first time out on San Fernando Road, I noticed that there were these mixed-up niches. There were Vietnamese kids, white kids, black kids, and there were Latinos. I wanted to reflect that in the movie.\u201d The scene in The Fast and the Furious where Dom hosts a barbecue in his L.A. backyard for his multicultural crew, his \u201cfamily,\u201d is the essence of what the franchise is about. And it\u2019s not an accident that Corona bottles line Dom\u2019s picnic table in that moment. As for how they got the beer in the movie, Cohen paints a pretty loose picture. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember, [in the late \u201990s], nobody believed in the movie. Nobody knew what the fuck it was.\u201d As such, the two parties didn\u2019t come close to approaching what would be considered a full-fledged product-placement deal. \u201cWe got some free beer. We reached out to Corona, and they responded like, \u2018We\u2019ll give you product and it\u2019s OK to use our name.\u2019\u201d Even as the years went on, and the impact of the Fast & Furious franchise grew exponentially, that arrangement defined the level of Corona\u2019s involvement. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to have Corona Extra play a part in pop culture history with the Fast and the Furious franchise over the years,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told The Ringer in an official statement. \u201cWhile we had no formal agreement with the production company, we were aware of the incorporation of Corona into several of the films.\u201d \u2018Fast & Furious,\u2019 2009 (Universal Pictures) The elephant in the 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS is the fact that moviemaking is a business, and product placement\u200a\u2014\u200aeven really good product placement\u200a\u2014\u200ais almost always about a capitalistic exchange, rather than world-building. Brands pay a production company to be prominently featured in a film. The exchange manifests in varying ways\u200a\u2014\u200afrom Heineken partially funding the production budget for 2015\u2019s Spectre with a product placement deal to Oliver Stone getting a free pair of boots for showing a certain brand name in Natural Born Killers. As Cohen noted, the initial deal between The Fast and the Furious and Corona was small and rather unofficial: a few cases of free beer in exchange for an overt mention of the brand name. \u201cThey were one of the companies that was smart enough to get in with us at the ground floor,\u201d Cohen adds. Whether the company actually foresaw the success of Fast or just didn\u2019t see the point in denying any movie\u2019s outright endorsement of their product, the decision to allow Corona to be featured in The Fast and the Furious has developed into a profitable one. \u201c[Corona is] the unpaid official beer of Fast & Furious,\u201d longtime producer Neal H. Moritz told The Bill Simmons Podcast. \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy. I should have a pallet of it in front of my house right now.\u201d \u2018Furious 7,\u2019 2015 (Universal Pictures) As a managing partner at Apex Marketing Group, Eric Smallwood analyzes the value of product placement and strategic advertising for both brands and production companies. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how it was used,\u201d he says of Corona\u2019s placement in the Fast franchise. \u201cThe verbal mentions\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s very overt.\u201d \u201cIf you were to poll people that saw these movies\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2018What kind of brand did you see in the movie?\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aa large percentage would say Corona,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s got a brand association with the franchise.\u201d That might not have mattered much to Corona\u2019s bottom line in 2001, but it has to these days, now that Fast & Furious is an international franchise whose last film made over $1.5 billion worldwide. \u201cThe more people see it, the more money the movie makes\u200a\u2014\u200abut also, the more awareness there is for the brand,\u201d says Smallwood. He estimates that Corona\u2019s product-placement value from Furious 7 is a whopping $6.1 million\u200a\u2014\u200abasically, more than it cost to buy a 30-second Super Bowl ad in 2017. In total, he estimates that the product-placement value for Corona from all of the films is about $15.3 million. And yet, according to everyone we spoke to, Corona doesn\u2019t even pay to be in the movies. \u201cOn all the stuff I\u2019ve ever done, I don\u2019t believe there ever was [a deal with Corona],\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe truth is we write it in there. We talk about it. It\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be, and not for any business reasons. It\u2019s part of Dom\u2019s character. It just is.\u201d \u201cI saw the original movie in the theater and I was just a fan.\u201d Having joined the franchise in 2006, Morgan is one of the most tenured members on the Fast team, and he\u2019s personally responsible for every Corona reference the movies have made since the original. He continues to bake them into his scripts for one primary reason: precedent. \u201cThey branded themselves [in the original],\u201d Morgan says. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re gonna fit in with our crew, this is what our crew does.\u2019\u201d When he first got to write for Dom in the fourth installment, Fast & Furious (Diesel appears in only the waning seconds of Tokyo Drift), Morgan used the mention and presence of Corona to show that while years have passed, the characters haven\u2019t changed. He achieved the same effect, wrapping continuity into nostalgia, with a barbecue scene that closes Fast & Furious 6\u200a\u2014\u200aand dutifully mirrors the barbecue scene of the original Fast, beer and all. \u2018Fast & Furious 6,\u2019 2013 (Universal Pictures) Cohen points out, \u201cThe sequels can get bigger. They can go to Abu Dhabi, Miami, Tokyo, wherever they want, but it all comes back to that picnic table, and that backyard with the skyline view.\u201d Along with continuing this sense of family, Morgan has also used Corona as a tool of self-awareness. Now eight movies into the franchise, there\u2019s over a decade worth of history to draw from\u200a\u2014\u200aand inside jokes to make. The scene featuring Corona in Furious 7, which might as well be a 30-second ad for the beer, even stylistically speaking, is the perfect example of that. The Family Values of \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019As the preeminent family-friendly franchise, \u2018Fast\u2019 can teach you a thing or twotheringer.com \u201cMr. Nobody is this mysterious guy\u200a\u2014\u200anobody knows who he is\u200a\u2014\u200aso the idea was to bring Dom to the office and start layering in a little bit of trust and familiarity,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cAnd you can talk about, \u2018Hey Dom, here\u2019s what I know you did with that car,\u2019 but I was looking for one thing to put in there to give the audience a wink. We played that for a joke, but also, this is how well this guy knows Dom. It\u2019s just a fun, character-y moment.\u201d The scene\u2019s greatest power, however\u200a\u2014\u200abeyond establishing Mr. Nobody\u2019s fastidiousness, beyond acting as a punch line, beyond displaying how comfortable the underwriters must be financially, that they\u2019d forgo such an obvious opportunity to make a product-placement deal\u200a\u2014\u200ais the way it confirms a camaraderie between those who make the Fast movies and those who watch them. This is a franchise that builds on itself and actively celebrates its history, rewarding those who have been there from the beginning with self-aware nods and self-deprecating in-jokes. Dom\u2019s line\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cAs long as it\u2019s a Corona\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ain The Fast and the Furious is so bewildering that it stands out in fans\u2019 memories.
