{"name": "1735", "parent": "", "content": "You Love What You Invest Yourself\u00a0In Until you love something, you\u2019ll never give everything you have for it. Passion fades. Love only becomes more powerful, regardless of the outcome. Love is the highest of all human motivations. The lower motivations\u200a\u2014\u200aavoiding punishment/pain, seeking reward/pleasure, and duty\u200a\u2014\u200aaren\u2019t even comparable to the power of love. Love takes the attention off of you and places it on someone or something else. When you love something, you put it before yourself. Very few display this level of devotion, where you\u2019re willing to be and do whatever is required. Where is your love directed? Give-Up Your Notion of \u201cAuthenticity\u201d If you want to make improvements in your life, you need to fundamentally change as a person. The idea of \u201cchanging yourself\u201d is off-putting to some. The desire to be \u201cauthentic\u201d keeps people stuck in unhealthy patterns. Said, David Heinemeier Hansson, author of Rework, \u201cJust be yourself\u201d is a terrible platitude for accepting the random attributes of character you\u2019ve acquired thus far.\u201d According to psychologist Carol Dweck, having the belief in a \u201cfixed\u201d identity can interfere with growth. Your identity isn\u2019t fixed. Without the belief that you can growth and change, all of your choices would be meaningless and irrelevant. If you truly love someone, you\u2019ll be who you need to be for that person. Your thoughts will be directed toward their happiness, not how they can make you happy. Your creativity will be towards creating meaningful experiences for them. If you love a particular cause, you\u2019ll be who you need to be to bring that cause forward. You won\u2019t let your current deficiencies stop you. You\u2019ll get educated. You\u2019ll acquire skills. You\u2019ll develop relationships. You\u2019ll fail. You work. You\u2019ll look foolish. It\u2019s not about you. Kierkegaard, Socrates, and Levinas all believed love is fundamentally directed toward something outside oneself. An over-focus on yourself keeps you stuck in your head and worried about your own feelings, rather than out in the world doing good. Forget yourself and get to work. Become who you must be for the people and causes you love. It is only in devoting yourself wholly to something outside of yourself that you become self-actualized. It cannot happen is a self-absorbed and self-concerned manner. Being about something far greater than yourself is the most beautiful way to live. Completely Own Where You Currently Are If you want a life more than you currently have, you must be more than you currently are. Said Benjamin Disraeli, \u201cMan is not the creature of circumstances, circumstances are the creatures of men.\u201d Your circumstances are a reflection of you. If your relationships are toxic, who\u2019s to blame? If your finances are a mess, who\u2019s to blame? If you hate your job, who\u2019s to blame? Of course there are external factors at play, but life organically shapes itself around your standards. Until you change, your circumstances won\u2019t. To quote Darren Hardy, \u201cTo achieve what you have not, you must become what you are not. You have to grow into your goals.\u201d Whatever it is you want in life, you must be that person before you can have it. Until you become that person, you are delusional. You won\u2019t \u201clive your dreams\u201d until you become the person who creates those dreams. Said Jim Rohn, \u201cSuccess is not to be pursued; it is to be attracted by the person you become.\u201d This reality has recently become very apparent to me. To be blunt, I\u2019ve been living far beneath the results I\u2019m seeking in my life. The reason is simple. I haven\u2019t loved deeply enough. I haven\u2019t loved my family enough. I haven\u2019t loved my clients enough. I haven\u2019t loved my work enough. I haven\u2019t loved my life enough. Because I haven\u2019t loved enough, I haven\u2019t been the person needed to make these things as great as they could be. I\u2019m not crying over this fact. I\u2019m not depressed. I\u2019m just stating the facts. I\u2019ve been selfish. \u201cLove is the only thing powerful enough to overcome everything holding you back.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aChris Chann, professional skateboarder Love is powerful enough to make hard and sometimes irrational decisions. Love is powerful enough to commit to something for the long-haul. Love is powerful enough to get you out of bed at 5AM and get to work. Love is powerful enough to learn things and acquire skills to benefit the lives of others. Love is powerful enough to change you into someone more and better than you currently are. Love is always directed outward. You Love What You Invest Yourself\u00a0In People often ask: How can I know what I WANT TO DO? How can I know what I\u2019m passionate about? These questions are misdirected. They\u2019re overtly focused on themselves and their own happiness. Happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue as the unintended consequence of devotion to something or someone else. Viktor Frankl believed this too, explaining it as the very reason for both survival in Nazi concentration camps and for success in life. Rather than worrying about what you\u2019re passionate about, invest yourself in something you believe in. You grow to love what you put your energy into. You love what you do well. You love what you\u2019ve sacrificed for. You love what you\u2019ve changed for. If you work hard in a particular class, you\u2019ll love that class. If you work hard on a project, you\u2019ll love that project. If you work hard writing a paper, you\u2019ll love that paper. If you invest yourself in a relationship, you\u2019ll love that person. Love comes from work. It\u2019s not a feeling. It\u2019s committed action. What do you love? Call To\u00a0Action Are you proactive?
