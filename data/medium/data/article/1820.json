{"name": "1820", "parent": "", "content": "The House of \u2018The Walking\u00a0Dead\u2019 Twenty-five years ago, seven acclaimed artists ditched their Marvel overlords and started a comic-book rebellion. They called it Image, and it rewrote the industry playbook. This is how the founders revolutionized an industry and launched a new generation of stars and \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 juggernaut. Todd McFarlane was tired. It was 1991, and the superstar comic-book artist was at the peak of his powers. In the year prior, McFarlane had launched a new Spider-Man title\u200a\u2014\u200asimply called Spider-Man\u200a\u2014\u200athat would sell more than 2.5 million copies for Marvel Comics. But he didn\u2019t have the respect from his editors that he thought he deserved. His days were filled with \u201csilly mini-confrontations\u201d with Marvel over the direction of the book, and with his first child on the way, McFarlane was over it. He needed a break, or at the very least, something new. That\u2019s when an opportunity presented itself. One day, while chatting with fellow Marvel artists Rob Liefeld and Erik Larsen, a simple idea dawned on them: What if we just made our own comics, together? \u201cThere were three of us who had the same general idea, but we were all going down our own separate tracks individually and emotionally,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cWhy are we talking about three different things that we\u2019re going to do on our own? Why don\u2019t we just do it together?\u201d McFarlane knew what had happened to some of the great comics creators before him. And he knew he didn\u2019t want to suffer the same fate. \u201cI had been doing a lot of reading on the history of comics, and the one thing that became abundantly clear to me was that comic artists had been coming and going one at a time for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was easy to deal with one-in-one-out from a corporate perspective. If you look at it like a sports franchise, you look at it and go, \u2018The Yankees may be able to live to tell about Derek Jeter not being there.\u2019\u201d Todd McFarlane and \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 editor Jim Salicrup (Courtesy Image\u00a0Comics) \u201cBut what if Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens, Mariano Rivera, and whoever else all retired the same year? That\u2019s an impact that has to now be taken seriously.\u201d On February 1, 1992, seven of the most popular artists in comics\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding McFarlane, Liefeld, and Larsen\u200a\u2014\u200asaid goodbye to Marvel to form a company of their own creation. It was called Image Comics. Today, Image is known as one of the industry\u2019s most influential tastemakers and home to beloved titles like Saga, The Wicked + The Divine, and The Walking Dead. The founders\u2019 gambit inspired a generation of writers and artists. Take it from Robert Kirkman, the creator of TWD: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ever created The Walking Dead if it wasn\u2019t for Image Comics.\u201d And if things had played out differently, Kirkman and his peers may not have even had a place to publish their work. Image\u2019s story is rife with turmoil, befitting the medium it embraces. It was a harbinger of great disruption, triggering panic and tumult in an industry whose record sales belied its tenuous state. To reinvigorate comics over its 25 years, Image had to play a part in its darkest period. To understand Image\u2019s impact, you need to know a little about the history of comics. Its past is littered with writers and artists frustrated by a lack of rights to and recognition for their work, from legends like Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster (the creators of Superman) and Jack Kirby (the cocreator of Marvel characters such as Captain America, the Hulk, and the X-Men) to more recent examples like the team of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons (the pair behind Watchmen). Writers and artists have spent decades creating for corporations without ownership to their name, despite being the foundation of the characters that prop up these media empires. They\u2019re idea factories, and that\u2019s led to comics creators being exploited to an extent that is unrivaled by other art forms. Historically, the vast majority of creators have stuck with Marvel or DC, the Coke and Pepsi of the industry. After all, that\u2019s where the money and opportunity have always been. On occasion, someone like Neal Adams or Howard Chaykin would leave the Big Two to create comics on their own, but the steady paychecks and relative stability offered there ensured creators almost always found their way back. Comics publishers had built and funded a medium where the creations were exponentially more valuable than the creators, and that imbalance ensured that the power stayed on their side. \u201cBut then in the early 1990s,\u201d said comics historian John Jackson Miller, \u201call the conditions had changed.\u201d Printing and color technology became inexpensive and accessible enough that independent comics companies could publish products that looked as refined and professional as what Marvel and DC were making. The industry itself was booming, with speculators from the sports-card industry fueling immense sales of new titles. To top it all off, a new generation of superstar artists, led by X-Men\u2019s Jim Lee, Spider-Man\u2019s McFarlane, and X-Force\u2019s Liefeld, were soaring into the stratosphere. The first issues of the aforementioned trio\u2019s titles had set sales records in the early \u201990s, with McFarlane\u2019s Spider-Man No. 1 moving nearly 3.3 million copies, Liefeld\u2019s X-Force No. 1 topping it at 3.5 million, and Lee\u2019s X-Men No. 1 setting a world record with nearly 8.2 million copies ordered, per internal publisher data provided by Miller\u2019s Comichron. \u201cThey were fucking monstrously popular,\u201d said Brian Hibbs, the owner of San Francisco\u2019s Comix Experience. \u201cThey were more popular than the characters themselves.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just their art, though. These artists were deemed cool in a way comics creators rarely were. Particularly Liefeld. \u201cThe first time people laid eyes on Rob Liefeld, they were like, \u2018This is the new breed,\u2019\u201d said comics journalist Heidi MacDonald. To steal a comics phrase, Liefeld was the bizarro version of the average artist. A fit, tan, young guy who loved the Lakers and starred in a Spike Lee\u2013directed Levi\u2019s commercial, Liefeld was just 23 years old when X-Force No. 1 was released. His manic energy and atypical, self-taught style was emblematic of Image\u2019s launch\u200a\u2014\u200ait was both familiar and without precedent. Rob Liefeld (Courtesy Image\u00a0Comics) \u201cI was fearless about what to do,\u201d said Liefeld, now 49. Unlike his peers, he didn\u2019t have kids, and that emboldened him. \u201cComic books and creating comic books was my 100 percent obsession.\u201d Arguably Liefeld\u2019s greatest gift as a creator was his ability to develop new characters in a medium well known for playing back the hits. His work on Marvel titles New Mutants and X-Force was propelled by fan favorites of his, particularly a certain talkative mercenary named Deadpool. (Which he cocreated with writer Fabian Nicieza, and has since become a massively successful film starring Ryan Reynolds.) With a background in independent comics\u200a\u2014\u200ahe debuted his Image creation Youngblood in a comic from publisher Megaton Comics\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019d always intended to return to do his own thing once he reached a certain point. But his schedule accelerated when he received an unexpected call from his bosses. \u201c[Marvel] called and told me the second line of X-Men toys was going to feature the X-Force characters,\u201d said Liefeld. \u201cI was like, \u2018What are you talking about? You just launched a line of X-Men toys and you\u2019re jumping 30 years of history and going right into mine?\u2019\u201d That was all the reason he needed to move toward authoring his own fate. Liefeld started doing just that at a dinner with Guardians of the Galaxy artist and writer Jim Valentino, Amazing Spider-Man artist Larsen, and Malibu Comics publisher Dave Olbrich at San Diego Comic-Con in 1991. \u201cRob asked Dave if he would publish a book by him,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cAnd Dave started laughing and said, \u2018Yeah, of course.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018How about a book by Jim and Erik?,\u2019 and Dave\u2019s laughing and goes, \u2018Yes, of course.\u2019\u201d Olbrich offered to publish anything they\u2019d like to create. Liefeld took out an ad in the September edition of the Comics Buyer\u2019s Guide, an industry paper. It was for a comic called The Executioners, with emphasis on the x. It was the first time the name \u201cImage Comics\u201d appeared in print. \u201cMarvel kind of flipped the fuck out,\u201d Larsen said. \u201c[X-Men editor] Bob Harras read him the riot act,\u201d said Valentino. \u201cThat he\u2019d never work in comics again, that they would sue him if he was profiting off of the X-franchise. \u201cIt didn\u2019t scare Rob, it just pissed him off.\u201d At that point, Liefeld turned to the people he was closest to in comics\u200a\u2014\u200aLarsen, Valentino, and McFarlane\u200a\u2014\u200awith the plan to break away from Marvel. Larsen and Valentino were onboard immediately. McFarlane saw an opportunity to break the cycle that had felled many artists before him. \u201cI remember having this epiphany, saying, \u2018Man, if they can do that to Jack Kirby\u200a\u2014\u200aThe King!\u200a\u2014\u200athey can do that to anybody,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said of Marvel\u2019s treatment of one of its founding fathers. He was in, too. On the strength of that foursome, Liefeld and McFarlane ventured to New York for an auction of their original art and a meeting with Marvel to let them know they were out. Everything escalated when McFarlane ran into Lee at the auction. \u201cI gave him the sales pitch. I go, \u2018Here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, here\u2019s why we\u2019re in town, and by the way, we\u2019d love to have you, dude,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. Jim Lee (Courtesy Image\u00a0Comics) By day\u2019s end, Jim Lee was in. This was when Image\u2019s potential skyrocketed\u200a\u2014\u200aeven relative to the rest of his cohort, Lee was a superstar. He was the most popular artist on Marvel\u2019s most popular franchise. Image without Lee would have been significant. With him, it was something more. \u201cI thought Jim Lee was the moment, because at this point Rob and I were the renegades,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cOf course the rebels are going to go into rebellion. It\u2019s who [we] were.\u201d \u201cJim Lee was the Golden Boy. He was the guy who followed and abided and was the perfect employee. And to me, he was the one who was going to send the loudest message,\u201d McFarlane continued. \u201cThey thought he was content, they thought he was happy, and even he\u2019s going.\u201d With Lee onboard, four became five. He even planned to join Liefeld and McFarlane at the meeting with Marvel. The evening before the meeting, McFarlane ran into Wolverine artist Marc Silvestri. They happened to be staying in the same hotel, and McFarlane took the opportunity to give him the hard sell. By the next morning, five was six. Lee, Liefeld, and McFarlane met with Marvel to let them know that the artists of 44 of the 50 top-selling comics of 1991 were leaving to form their own company. \u201cWe were essentially the Dream Team,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cSo the Dream Team was about to walk out of the office, and of course it was going to have an impact.\u201d While the events of the meeting with Marvel\u200a\u2014\u200awhich included Liefeld, Lee, McFarlane, his wife and newborn child, Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco, and Marvel president Terry Stewart\u200a\u2014\u200achange depending on who tells the story, McFarlane insisted it was straightforward. \u201cWe just said, \u2018We\u2019re leaving, and here are a couple reasons why,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. The part McFarlane said he will always remember, and one of the things that ensured his future as the Image founder who would never work for Marvel again, was what DeFalco said to Lee and McFarlane as they departed: If it doesn\u2019t work, they were welcome back anytime. Marvel was skeptical about Image\u2019s potential. McFarlane was taken aback. \u201c\u2018Wow. He just thinks we\u2019re dumbasses,\u2019\u201d McFarlane recalled thinking. \u201cIt was a bit of an insult.\u201d In 1991, when a comics creator left Marvel, they\u2019d head to DC for work, or vice versa. McFarlane didn\u2019t want that to be the expectation, so after the Marvel meeting, McFarlane and Lee went to DC\u2019s offices. While McFarlane had worked for DC in the past, Lee hadn\u2019t. Because of that, \u201cthey thought they hit the mother lode,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cWe get into the meeting and we go, \u2018By the way, we\u2019re here to tell you the same thing. We\u2019re not here to work for you, either,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cWhen we walked out of DC, that was day one of Image being official.\u201d Then came the tricky part: The founders had to figure out what Image would be. Even though each had different reasons for the move, Image\u2019s genesis came down to creative freedom and ownership\u200a\u2014\u200athe ability for artists to control their own fate and get compensated the way they felt they deserved. \u201cWe all saw the mistakes that everybody else made before us and decided not to repeat them,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cWe also set up the company in such a way that was favorable to us and therefore favorable to anyone else who came in. We had a very long view.\u201d The first meeting of Image Comics commenced on February 1, 1992, at Silvestri\u2019s Malibu home. This was when the seventh founder, Uncanny X-Men artist Whilce Portacio, joined the fray. While he wasn\u2019t at the meeting in Malibu\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was in the Philippines at the time\u200a\u2014\u200aPortacio was a friend of Lee\u2019s, and one who everyone liked and respected. He was in. From there, the six attending founders decided two major things that day: (1) Image Comics would incorporate after a year with Malibu Comics\u200a\u2014\u200awith whom they worked initially for infrastructure purposes\u200a\u2014\u200aand (2) each of the partners would have complete autonomy, which included the ability to launch independent studios creating titles that would be published under the Image banner. This independence was essential to the publisher and its founders (although upon Image\u2019s incorporation the next year, Portacio declined to become a partner in the business for personal reasons). In the same meeting, the six also agreed that the deal they were giving themselves\u200a\u2014\u200awhere the creators owned their creations\u200a\u2014\u200awould be offered to others, too. \u201cWe created the company that we wanted to work for, a company that would respect creators and their creations,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cWe wanted to create the anti-Marvel, the anti-DC, because it was the right thing to do.\u201d When news of their move hit, the reaction was mixed. Some were surprised; others were angry. \u201cI was really surprised at the news, as I think most people in comics were at the time,\u201d said Karen Berger, then an editor at DC. \u201cIt was a really bold and audacious move.\u201d \u201c[My reaction] was complete and utter disbelief. It was so shocking that this would be happening,\u201d comics journalist MacDonald said. \u201cFrom [the] fans\u2019 [perspective] it was almost entirely positive,\u201d Larsen said, before adding that some considered them \u201ctraitors\u201d for leaving Marvel. For the most part, however, fans were ecstatic. This meant original comics from some of the most exciting creators around and a new company whose heat in the industry rivaled, if not surpassed, Marvel\u2019s and DC\u2019s. The move defied decades of history, as the partners became even more popular by leaving the world\u2019s greatest heroes behind. Valentino described it by saying the founders simply \u201cchanged jobs,\u201d but this wasn\u2019t just a lateral movement; it was the most shocking move in the history of the comics industry. In April 1992, Liefeld\u2019s Youngblood launched to towering sales, with orders of its first issue topping 1 million copies. Image Comics was instantaneously a sensation. Each partner followed Liefeld with their own title in 1992. The first was McFarlane, the only founder whose first title\u200a\u2014\u200aSpawn\u200a\u2014\u200awas intended to be an ongoing series from the start. (According to Larsen, every other founder had planned to open with limited series in case the sales weren\u2019t there.) Spawn was a character McFarlane had developed as a teenager, well before he had made it at Marvel. The series was about a demonic antihero who, after he was killed in a previous life, made a deal with a devil so he could see his wife again. It was a perfect showcase of what everyone loved about his art, minus the editorial oversight that surely would have reined in the dark subject matter. Fans ate it up, with the first issue selling 1.7 million copies, a previously unthinkable number for an independent comic starring an original character. The summer saw the launch of Larsen\u2019s The Savage Dragon (featuring a character he created in elementary school that was first published at Megaton Comics), Valentino\u2019s Shadowhawk, Lee\u2019s WildC.A.T.s, and a second title from Liefeld (Brigade), with Silvestri\u2019s Cyberforce and Supreme (a third title from Liefeld\u2019s Extreme Studios) arriving by the end of the year. The first year also brought the first defection from Marvel to Image after the founders, with Incredible Hulk artist Dale Keown launching Pitt in January 1993. The company\u2019s lineup was quickly filling up. Even better, each was a hit. Valentino said that every Image launch that first year sold more than half a million copies, which would have been a monster success for Marvel or DC. For a collective of renegade artists? \u201cThis was a phenomenon that does not really have a comparison you can make,\u201d Comix Experience\u2019s Hibbs said. \u201cIt was a movement for a lot of people.\u201d \u201cI just remember [saying] every day, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen today?\u2019\u201d Liefeld said. \u201cWe were a seismic wave of a cultural shift in the comic-book industry. You could feel it. It was exciting.\u201d Liefeld wasn\u2019t wrong. Malibu\u200a\u2014\u200apowered by the Image titles\u200a\u2014\u200atopped DC Comics in market share in August 1992 with just a fraction of DC\u2019s releases. In that first year, Image had nine titles on limited runs, which managed to comprise 24 of the top-100 selling comics of the year. In fact, the only title that sold more than the highest-selling Image release in 1992 was Superman No. 75\u200a\u2014\u200awhich famously featured the hero\u2019s death. While events like Superman\u2019s death or Batman being replaced after having his back broken by a new foe named Bane can\u2019t definitively be tied to pressure from Image\u2019s success, a major event series that DC announced shortly after Liefeld had launched Youngblood felt more reactionary. It was called Bloodlines, and it featured the publisher unleashing a legion of new Liefeldesque characters known as the New Bloods. Marvel, not to be left behind, doubled up its 1993 annuals, introducing its own wave of new characters and an Avengers and X-Men crossover event, titled Bloodties. Image was so hot that even Marvel and DC wanted to ride the wave the founders had created. While Image was designed to support the greatest comics artists and the finest storytellers, the launch lineup was filled with familiar ideas: Every title was a superhero book of sorts. That was by design, as the founders knew what their fans wanted. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t our intention for the company to be a superhero company,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cIt was our intention to compete with Marvel and DC.\u201d The tactic worked. As Hibbs shared with me, Image titles like WildC.A.T.s were selling X-Men numbers in a time when Marvel\u2019s franchise players were in their own stratosphere. In their efforts to put creators above characters, the Image founders managed to create characters that rivaled the medium\u2019s biggest names (for a time). Everywhere they went, the Image founders were followed by adoring fans. Their signings were events of a size typically saved for rock stars, with 1992\u2019s Chicago Comic-Con needing a special tent in its parking lot just to accommodate their tens of thousands of supporters. With Image\u2019s success came rapid growth. Liefeld was the first to develop his own line of comics at his imprint, Extreme Studios, with Lee\u2019s WildStorm Productions and Silvestri\u2019s Top Cow Productions expanding their footprint shortly thereafter. Because of that, Image performed even better in 1993. Forty-one of the 100 best-selling comics that year featured Image\u2019s unmistakable \u201ci\u201d icon on the cover. However, for new comics publishers, managing growth can be tricky. Image\u2019s expansion led to the first cracks in its armor. \u201c[Image] enthusiastically announced a lot of titles from outside creators right away in the summer of 1992, but that made it all the harder to keep books on time out of the gate,\u201d Miller said. \u201cA number of advertised books never came out at all.\u201d \u201cYou can now argue our na\u00efvet\u00e9 and the pennies raining down from heaven were some of the early undoings of what we did,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cBecause you go, \u2018Oh my gosh, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing, but we\u2019re making money, and oh by the way, I have so much money, why do I need to work?\u2019 \u201cThis is sort of the curse of anybody that is young. Don\u2019t give them too much success too fast, because we don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d Larry Marder, a cartoonist who was renowned for his industry savvy, was brought on in 1993 as executive director to get Image\u2019s house in order. But by then its scheduling issues were already having a significant impact on the industry. Tom Spurgeon, a comics historian who was just starting at industry magazine The Comics Journal at the time, said he\u2019d heard Image described as \u201cthis giant toddler smashing things,\u201d at least in part because its books were \u201cso successful they were immediately off schedule.\u201d At the time, there were no protections for retailers, according to Spurgeon. So if a book was off schedule, there was no recourse. Comics shops would pay for the product regardless of whether they would actually receive it on time. Eric Reynolds, now the associate publisher at Fantagraphics, was an editor at The Comics Journal at the time, and he said that Image\u2019s actions had a massive domino effect within the industry. Image\u2019s best-known and late-shipping titles would arrive months after the promised release date, tying up retailer budgets and then failing to sell once they finally arrived. \u201cThey single-handedly fucked up the cash flow of an entire industry and ruined a lot of retailers,\u201d Reynolds said. As a retailer at the time, Hibbs had a front-row seat to this destructive period. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what they were doing when it came to publishing houses and they overcommitted and started putting out books later and later,\u201d Hibbs said. \u201cThey started adding so many spinoffs that people didn\u2019t want and doing everything we spent years criticizing Marvel and DC for. People tend to make the mistakes of the generation before without even realizing it.\u201d Despite those struggles, Image was still moving huge numbers of units. It wasn\u2019t just Image; the whole industry was. Until 1993. That\u2019s when everything fell apart. In the years previous, comic-book distributors like Capital City Distribution and Diamond Comic Distributors\u200a\u2014\u200awhose role was to circulate comics from publishers to retail stores\u200a\u2014\u200aaided in expanding the market to more than 10,000 retail accounts. While this sounds like a good thing on the surface, many of these shops were undercapitalized and overextended. That growth, paired with a boom fueled by speculators buying up multiple copies of the hottest titles in hopes of a quick buck, meant the comics industry was in a bubble waiting to be burst. While indicators had been there since the early days of the publisher\u200a\u2014\u200aa Barron\u2019s story in February 1992 on Marvel\u2019s unsold inventory problem mentioned the departure of the group that would found Image\u200a\u2014\u200ait wasn\u2019t until 1993 that the overexpansion of the industry led to massive store closures and publishers being forced to face reality. Those huge order numbers meant a sizable chunk of comics, including Image titles, were collecting dust across the country. With speculators leaving comics behind and the sales potential of the medium plummeting, the industry was in trouble. Publishers cut back their lines, which meant there were fewer comics for the remaining shops to sell, which eventually led to even more shops closing. The days of new Image titles launching with more than a million copies ordered were coming to a close. This culminated in widespread consolidation within the industry, including what pundits call the \u201cdistributor wars.\u201d When Image launched, comics were distributed by a bevy of houses (including both Capital City and Diamond), allowing for competition. However, Marvel responded to Image\u2019s success by buying its own distribution company\u200a\u2014\u200aHeroes World\u200a\u2014\u200aso it wouldn\u2019t have to compete with DC and Image for space in distributor catalogs. That wasn\u2019t the smartest play\u200a\u2014\u200aas comics historian Spurgeon said, aligning national orders with a regional distributor was \u201cnot the best plan\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut the cascading moves it compelled DC and Image to make exacerbated the problem. While Marvel signed up with Heroes World, DC and fellow publisher Dark Horse Comics paired with Diamond Comics Distributors. At that point, Image was \u201cin a very important position that could have kept so much consolidation from happening,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cBut instead [Image] somewhat cravenly took the path of least resistance by lining up behind DC and Dark Horse, despite positioning themselves as rebels and mavericks. Image was the tipping point in putting Capital City Distribution out of business, thereby ending the distributor wars and giving Diamond a de facto monopoly it still maintains.\u201d The final straw in this dark period for Image came between 1996 and 1998, when two of the founders departed. First, Liefeld left amid controversy after he\u2019d created a competitive comics company and was accused of attempting to poach talent from other Image studios. Then, Lee sold his studio\u200a\u2014\u200aWildStorm\u200a\u2014\u200ato DC Comics so he could focus on the creative side. Six became four. Image was fractured. \u201cThe thing that was hurting us the most isn\u2019t that we lack the skills or we don\u2019t have the ideas or we don\u2019t know people who can help us. It\u2019s just starting to treat Image like a real business and not letting it be a frat house,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cWe sort of got scared straight, more than anything else, because we saw not only was the industry deteriorating from the bubble bursting back in 1992 and 1993, [but] we were also exacerbating it by some of our own personal actions and some of our corporate actions.\u201d \u201cWe [said], \u2018Hey, if we don\u2019t start acting a little more mature, then this may be a hard fall here,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cAnd none of us wanted the hard fall.\u201d The remaining partners\u200a\u2014\u200aLarsen, McFarlane, Silvestri, and Valentino\u200a\u2014\u200ahad to figure out how to recover, especially after Lee\u2019s departure. His studio had been a huge part of Image\u2019s lineup, and to ensure continued success and future potential, a void had to be filled. Make the wrong move and they\u2019d become an impressive but ultimately fleeting footnote in comics history. Make the right one, and the potential was significant. In their recovery effort, the partners took on more active roles in ensuring Image\u2019s success, with Valentino taking the lead as publisher in 1999. While the line had diversified beyond superheroes in its early years to include titles like Mike Grell\u2019s mystical tale Shaman\u2019s Tears and Colleen Doran\u2019s space epic A Distant Soil, Valentino was displeased with risqu\u00e9 titles that pushed titillation above all else. He worked to rebuild Image\u2019s line. \u201cI told the guys, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to have a scorched-earth policy,\u2019\u201d Valentino said. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to start all over because we can do better than that.\u2019\u201d While its sales paled in comparison with Image\u2019s previous levels with Valentino as publisher, it was a different, smaller comics industry after the bubble burst. More importantly, with Valentino at the head of the company, Image preserved its place as the industry\u2019s third-largest publisher\u200a\u2014\u200awhich was important to maintaining distribution deals\u200a\u2014\u200aand started to bring fresh blood into the fold, including creators like Warren Ellis and Brian Michael Bendis. Robert Kirkman in 2012 (Jerod Harris/WireImage) Another who joined the ranks during Valentino\u2019s time as publisher was Robert Kirkman, who is now arguably the most famous modern comic-book creator. While he\u2019s a household name now thanks to the success of The Walking Dead, back in Image\u2019s darkest days, he was \u201csome rando writer from Rando Town, Kentucky,\u201d as writer Joe Keatinge put it. (He was born in Lexington, Kentucky.) He\u2019d always wanted to make comics for Image\u200a\u2014\u200aKirkman told me that when the founders departed from Marvel, it was one of the most influential moments of his life. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the child of Image,\u201d Valentino said. While a few small projects put Kirkman in the building, a pair of books changed everything for him and signaled the beginning of Image\u2019s return to being a key player in comics. The first was Invincible, a superhero comic he cocreated with Cory Walker before he and artist Ryan Ottley developed it into one of the longest-running\u200a\u2014\u200aand consistently great\u200a\u2014\u200atitles of Image\u2019s line. The other, of course, was The Walking Dead. Kirkman pitched Image on The Walking Dead only after Invincible found its footing. But Valentino was unimpressed with the initial pitch. \u201cHe approached us with this zombie book that he was originally calling \u2018World of the Zombies,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Robert, that\u2019s horrible,\u2019\u201d Valentino said. For this book to work, Valentino told Kirkman, it needed a hook. \u201cSo [Kirkman] said, \u2018OK, the zombies are an alien invasion,\u2019\u201d Valentino told me. \u201cAnd about three or four issues into it, Eric Stephenson [then Image\u2019s director of sales and marketing] called him up and said, \u2018So where\u2019s the aliens?\u2019\u201d \u201cRobert laughed and said, \u2018There are no aliens. I just told you guys that so you would publish it,\u2019\u201d Valentino added with a laugh. Aliens or not, The Walking Dead\u200a\u2014\u200awhich started with Tony Moore as artist before Charlie Adlard took the reins on Issue no. 7\u200a\u2014\u200abecame one of the most uncommon stories in comics: a title that started with low sales (fewer than 7,300 copies of its first printing were ordered, per estimates) and steadily increased until it became one of the industry\u2019s top sellers. From there, the TV show launched and a media empire was formed, sending its sales into rarefied air. An issue that hits stores today is already the highest-selling single issue in nearly 20 years, thanks in part to its cover price of a quarter to honor Image\u2019s anniversary. However, its collections are the series\u2019 biggest revenue generator. These paperback and hardcover books bundle issues together in bulk so you can binge-read the series, perfect for crossover TV fans. Millions of the collections have been purchased, with the first compendium\u200a\u2014\u200aat a cover price of $60\u200a\u2014\u200aestimated to have sold more than 450,000 copies as of the end of 2015. In recent years, The Walking Dead has had an annual market share as high as 2.5 percent of the total comic shop market by itself. It doesn\u2019t stop there, of course. The Walking Dead is a phenomenon beyond comic-book racks. Even accounting for a recent ratings slide, its TV show is an enormous hit that draws in the largest audience in the coveted 18-to-49 demographic of any nonsports program, cable or network. The video game series developed by Telltale Games set in TWD\u2019s world has earned massive acclaim and sales of more than 28 million as of 2014, with a third season launching this past December. While many of the original titles are well liked among fans, the deal that Image developed at its inception for its founders\u200a\u2014\u200aand then passed on to others\u200a\u2014\u200ais in many ways Image\u2019s most lasting and impactful creation. Image itself takes only a flat dollar amount from each print comic it sells, while getting a fixed percentage from each collection or digital comic. That means the bulk of potential profits and all of the rights belong to the creators\u200a\u2014\u200athe latter being a key difference-maker in this adaptation-loving era. If an Image comic becomes a movie or TV show\u200a\u2014\u200alike The Walking Dead\u200a\u2014\u200athe creators are the ones who reap the profits. That\u2019s not to say Image doesn\u2019t benefit from adaptations, as the success of a TV show like The Walking Dead can be a major boon to a comic series\u2019 sales, particularly those of collections. While Image may not directly profit from the show, its indirect upside can be enormous. That structure results in a longer path to earning money and fewer guarantees of a job than from, say, Marvel or DC, but it also means significantly greater potential earnings for those willing to take the leap. It\u2019s high-variance, but it\u2019s an offer that can\u2019t be beat, especially if you\u2019re an established creator. \u201cIt\u2019s the absolute best deal in comics,\u201d Kirkman said. It\u2019s not just the monetary rights that speak to creators. While every writer or artist I spoke to had worked with Marvel and/or DC, many touted the creative freedom that Image offered. It\u2019s why creators like writer Kieron Gillen release passion projects at the place where they can most fully realize them. \u201cIf you could do anything, there\u2019s the implication you should at least try to do something,\u201d Gillen said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not using that blank paper for something big, different, redefining, you\u2019re somehow wasting it,\u201d he said, before adding with a laugh, \u201cbut that\u2019s my own personal bullshit.\u201d Several people I spoke to shared that Image is where you can find the biggest talent in comics \u201cwith the brakes off,\u201d as Gillen put it, and that\u2019s a significant advantage. To be able to create, completely unfettered, is a dream for all artists. That\u2019s different from working at Marvel or DC, where an important part of your role is as a caretaker of intellectual property. You can tell the stories you want with their characters, but only if it fits within their plans. Creating at Image, on the other hand, is closer to self-publishing than working at Marvel or DC. Yet this deal had been available for a long time before creators began migrating en masse to Image around 2009, so the question becomes, \u201cWhat changed?\u201d One of the biggest factors was Kirkman\u2019s success, which has had an incalculable impact on the fate of Image, and not just because of the revenue it brought in when the company most needed it. The Walking Dead proved the Image model could work even if you weren\u2019t a top star\u200a\u2014\u200athat the right idea could be a million-dollar one. \u201cYou need this wedge product that is able to prove to people that it\u2019s possible,\u201d said MacDonald of The Walking Dead. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a matter of people seeing it works,\u201d Larsen added. \u201cThat you can look at it and go, suddenly there\u2019s this Robert Kirkman and he\u2019s got this TV show and things are wonderful for him and he doesn\u2019t seem to be getting screwed over.\u201d Joe Keatinge said that his comic, Shutter (cocreated with Leila del Duca), wouldn\u2019t be around if Kirkman hadn\u2019t been there to hand off the baton. \u201cShutter can exist because the success of books like Sex Criminals, Fatale, Bitch Planet, and Saga opened up the doors for weird books by new creators to exist. Their doors got opened by Robert. His doors got opened by the founders,\u201d Keatinge said. \u201cYou gotta keep opening those doors, man\u200a\u2014\u200aRobert certainly has for me and many others.\u201d In 2008, Kirkman\u2019s relationship with Image was taken to another level when, despite having significant success working on for-hire projects, he left Marvel for good and became Image\u2019s first new partner since the company had been founded. Shortly after that, Kirkman unleashed a video mission statement known as \u201cThe Kirkman Manifesto\u201d on the comic industry. In the video, Kirkman suggests that comics creators should build up their names at Marvel or DC and then leave to find greater financial success creating their own work. This was the opposite of the typical career path in comics. Historically, writers and artists worked tirelessly on their own comics to become well known enough for Marvel or DC to hire them. Kirkman challenged this paradigm and encouraged creators to take full authorship. It was that kind of belief that inspired the partners to bring him onboard. Beyond admiring his work and his character, the Image founders saw a reflection of themselves, 16 years later. \u201cHe had given up a lucrative deal at Marvel, and both Marvel and DC were chasing after him at the time, and he was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do this and I\u2019m only going to do this,\u2019\u201d Valentino said. \u201cThat impressed us because that\u2019s what we did.\u201d For McFarlane, the biggest reason to add him to the mix was simple: Kirkman is a writer. Artists founded Image, and every writer they\u2019d worked with had been unwilling to commit fully to the brand. \u201cThe writers, I kept telling them, \u2018If you want your books to succeed, you have to quit Marvel and DC,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t heed that simple rule.\u201d To McFarlane, writers create competition against themselves if they don\u2019t fully commit in one direction, hamstringing the potential of their own creations. \u201cRobert not only figured [that] out on his own, he cut Marvel and DC out cold turkey as a writer. He was the first guy. I had been railing against this for what seemed like forever,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden there was this bright, shining light. Some writer was doing it on his own and was acting like an artist. He kept his skills all on his own books, so you now have to buy his books, not some corporation\u2019s books.\u201d While Liefeld was no longer a partner when Kirkman was elevated, he believes Kirkman\u2019s ascent has been essential to Image\u2019s rise, touting The Walking Dead as Image\u2019s own version of Batman or The Avengers. \u201cImage Comics exists in the form it does today because of Robert Kirkman and everything he\u2019s done,\u201d Liefeld said. \u201cYou cannot have a discussion about Image Comics, from about 2008 to present, that does not involve his success carrying the company and giving it a new foundation to build on, [which] allows Eric Stephenson to make the moves he makes.\u201d Stephenson is the other catalyst in Image\u2019s rise over the past decade. While he has been at Image since 1992\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was a writer and editor at Liefeld\u2019s Extreme Studios before joining Image as director of sales and marketing in 2001\u200a\u2014\u200ahis promotion to publisher in 2008 has been essential to the company\u2019s success. \u201cRobert is the right hand,\u201d said Liefeld. \u201cEric is the left hand.\u201d \u201cEric Stephenson isn\u2019t one important aspect to Image\u2019s present success in terms of how the company\u2019s run,\u201d Keatinge said. \u201cHe\u2019s the aspect to Image\u2019s present success in terms of how the company\u2019s run.\u201d \u201cHis contributions have been incalculable,\u201d added Valentino. Kirkman\u2019s success was a bellwether for the potential of the Image approach, but it had existed for more than a decade and a half by the time Stephenson had taken over. They needed someone who wouldn\u2019t just convey the value of the deal, but help creators find the potential of their strongest ideas. Spurgeon believes a big part of Stephenson\u2019s ability to do that relied on the fact he wasn\u2019t a creator or a businessman: He was both. \u201cI think the overall quality of the line is higher than it\u2019s ever been and I think that is because of Eric. I think it\u2019s [because] he can wear both hats,\u201d Spurgeon said. \u201cThat\u2019s hugely valuable.\u201d Stephenson and Kirkman work closely, and the latter clearly has great admiration for the former and the way he helps creators find the best version of their own work. Stephenson\u2019s method for doing so is simple, according to Kirkman. \u201cThe real heart of what Eric Stephenson does, and this is a story I tell people a lot, he\u2019ll talk to a big creator and they\u2019ll call him up and be like, \u2018What book are you looking for Eric? What would Image want from me?,\u2019\u201d Kirkman said. \u201cAnd his answer is always, \u2018I want the book that you want to do.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not looking for something specific. There\u2019s not a specific genre that he\u2019s trying to service. He\u2019s not a television network saying, \u2018Well, sci-fi shows are popular.\u2019 That\u2019s not how Eric Stephenson works.\u201d Since Stephenson became publisher, Image has launched exciting and unexpected titles that have won awards and been best sellers with concepts that likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten published at such a scale in years past. Comics like Chew, from writer John Layman and artist Rob Guillory, which tells the story of an FDA agent who receives psychic impressions from what he eats as he deals with life after a bird flu epidemic killed millions. Or Sex Criminals, Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky\u2019s comic about a couple who can stop time when they orgasm and use said powers to rob banks. Image doesn\u2019t exactly publish Superman. \u201cThe way you get books like that is by looking at what\u2019s not happening in the marketplace, the niches that aren\u2019t being filled,\u201d Stephenson said, \u201cand big-picture, that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll ultimately grow our industry, because just giving people the same thing over and over again is going to appeal to fewer and fewer readers as time goes on.\u201d No comic showcases that mentality better than Saga, a space epic by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Fiona Staples. While it was certain to garner plenty of attention as Vaughan\u2019s return to comics\u200a\u2014\u200aafter wrapping titles like Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina, he worked in TV for several years as a writer for Lost and the executive producer on Under the Dome\u2019s first season\u200a\u2014\u200areaders quickly made it Vaughan\u2019s and Staples\u2019s biggest hit to date. Saga won three consecutive Eisner Awards, the comic-book world\u2019s Oscars, for Best Continuing Series from 2013 to 2015, as well as individual wins for Vaughan and Staples. The title, which could be described as a marriage between Star Wars and Romeo and Juliet, isn\u2019t just a good comic, though. Its diverse cast and progressive themes helped it fill some of the niches Stephenson spoke of, making it both the symbol of Image\u2019s success and the changing face of comics. In recent years, readership has evolved, with digital comics giant ComiXology revealing in 2013 that the fastest-growing segment of readers were 17-to-26-year-old women who were newer to comics. As MacDonald said, \u201cSaga really appealed to this influx of female readers,\u201d and the results have been stunning. The title has generated sales that rival The Walking Dead without a movie or TV deal in sight. In the comics industry of yesteryear, certain markets were massively underserved. Saga\u2019s arrival was a shining example that readers of all types would respond if given something that speaks to them. Liefeld calls Stephenson a \u201ctastemaker,\u201d and he\u2019s proved that with the titles published under his watch. \u201cI think he\u2019s really transformed Image into the safe haven it\u2019s become for the best and brightest of the current generation,\u201d Kirkman said. Despite a tumultuous run-up to the milestone, 25 years later Image Comics is\u200a\u2014\u200ain the words of Hibbs\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cprobably the most vital [comics] publisher we have.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else would have been able to help Fiona and me reach as large an audience as we did, while still giving us total creative freedom and true ownership of our characters,\u201d Vaughan said. Very little is the same since Image launched, but the one constant has been the deal the founders created 25 years ago. It\u2019s what helped them make it through their most challenging period. And it all comes back to what the founders were looking for themselves: true economic and creative freedom. \u201cImage is the best comic company in the world because the emphasis is in the right place,\u201d writer Jonathan Hickman said. Not only have creators flocked to the publisher to develop some of the medium\u2019s most beloved titles, but Image\u2019s place in the market has improved as well. The industry has made a huge recovery in recent years\u200a\u2014\u200aaccording to Comichron, it has increased in value from a low of $255 million to $275 million in 2000 to $940 million in 2015\u200a\u2014\u200aand Image has seen its market share grow from under 3 percent in terms of total dollars in June 2009 to nearly 9 percent in December 2016. It\u2019s a dramatic turnaround that has firmly entrenched Image in a familiar spot as the third-largest North American comics publisher. Of the original founders, only Larsen, McFarlane, Silvestri, and Valentino remain. As partners, they\u2019re important to determining the overall direction of the company. Both McFarlane\u2019s Spawn and Larsen\u2019s Savage Dragon are still being published, with Larsen still creating every aspect of the book\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like he was in 1992. Lee is now the copublisher of DC Entertainment. Liefeld mended his relationship with Image with the help of Kirkman and is developing a new era for his Extreme Universe there, building off of a recent reported seven-figure movie deal. Portacio still resides on the creative side, working on projects for Marvel, DC, and Image over the years. Even the company itself recently relocated from the Bay Area to Portland, Oregon. Image has fulfilled the promise it had when it first started, even if took an unexpected path to getting there. \u201cI remember I went to one of the Image Expos [a yearly event Image holds to announce new titles] and one of the things that struck me as interesting and a little bit of a mixed bag because we all have our egos, [was realizing], \u2018Wow, this whole room is about Image. If I wasn\u2019t here, it would still be exactly the same,\u2019\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that what we did at the beginning in 1992 as a group didn\u2019t start the ball rolling. It\u2019s just the ball is rolling pretty good right now, and it doesn\u2019t need any big pushes from the original founders now. \u201cMy greatest sense of pride is we\u2019re still here 25 years later.\u201d An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated that Battle Pope was Robert Kirkman\u2019s first project for Image Comics; that reference has been removed. Also, the piece inaccurately stated that the company takes a fixed percentage from each comic and collection it sells; Image takes a flat dollar amount from each comic it sells, and a fixed percentage from each collection or digital comic.
