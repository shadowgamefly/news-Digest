It\u2019s not because there isn\u2019t a dearth of talent, and it\u2019s not because product leadership isn\u2019t an absolutely necessity for any startup. It\u2019s because no discipline is as misunderstood, misapplied, mystified, misnamed and mistaken, as the product discipline. Today is a big day for Mylestone. After a 5 month search we welcome Drew Condon as our new Head of Product. [Editor\u2019s Note: Thank dear god. I don\u2019t really pray, but if I did, someone certainly blessed me on this one.]. If you\u2019re hiring product leadership, be forewarned: this is no high school dance. Buckle in, it\u2019s time to do the rhumba. One of these two is a great product\u00a0leader 1. Learn what product is. Then learn it\u00a0again. What the hell is \u201cproduct\u201d anyway? This is a discipline that evolves so fast, even the experienced require continuous education. This Quora thread is a good initial cheat sheet: What is a Product Manager?Answer (1 of 20): It depends on the industry and the company. I will answer it from a tech startup perspective.\u2026www.quora.com Finished reading? Good, now read 50 more articles just like this throughout your search. Wash, rinse, repeat. 2. Decide the\u00a0Macro During their time at Runkeeper, Max Freiert and Drew Condon were apparently a \u201ctwo-headed product monster.\u201d Max was the \u201cbusiness\u201d guy, Drew the \u201cdesign\u201d guy. They both led big chunks of the product\u200a\u2014\u200ausually together and occasionally overlapping. I talked to a number of people at Runkeeper who explained it this way: Max was focused on how to generate value. Drew was focused on designing the experience so consumers understood it. Before you get started, you have a macro question to answer: Do you need someone to figure out the business itself, or someone to design the business so customers engage? Wanting \u201cboth\u201d is a fair answer, but candidates will lean heavily one way or the other, so you should, too. 3. Consider the 4 Foundations Every product leader\u2019s skills are rooted in some foundation, based on early career history. These will translate into unfair advantages and how they\u2019ll execute for you\u200a\u2014\u200ahere are the 4 most common foundations: 4. Seek Advice, Send\u00a0Scotch Scour your network to find product experts willing to impart a little wisdom. Given they aren\u2019t interviewing for the job, their ability to advise and provide unfettered feedback is incredible. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a purple squirrel,\u201d advised Richard Banfield, the CEO of Fresh Tilled Soil, on the first of a handful of\u00a0calls. Banfield was right by the way, and anything more than 3 calls requires a scotch delivery. Drizly to the rescue. Drew Condon, Purple Squirrel? 5. Identify \u201cTalent Look-Alikes\u201d Yeah, you\u2019re going to plunder LinkedIn to connect with candidates in your network. But when that well runs dry, then what? Here\u2019s a trick to finding a slew of people you might otherwise overlook: Steve Street | LinkedInFrom prototyping a new product with users to harmonizing your UX across multiple digital properties, corporations and\u2026www.linkedin.com Steve Street is one of the most talented product guys you\u2019ll meet. He wouldn\u2019t let me hire him, so I used him as a \u201cTalent Look Alike\u201d to find others who described themselves just like him. 6. Don\u2019t Get Flummoxed by\u00a0Titles You. Product People. Get your stories straight. What\u2019s with all the mix-master-grandflash-mashing of your damn\u00a0titles? Case in point: UX Designers now seem to be called Product Designers. So are you a product person or a designer? Oh wait, product is design now? What\u2019s that\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re an \u201cexperience\u201d designer, but not a \u201cvisual\u201d designer? Ok, so I want a product designer, but not a visual designer, but one that has UX capabilities? So what do you do? 7. 90 Minutes, No More, No\u00a0Less After a candidate has met a few team members\u200a\u2014\u200aand you\u2019ve qualified chemistry\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s time to dive deeper. Outline a specific challenge, and have the candidate lead a group strategy session as if they already had the job. Make it 90 minutes; long enough to go deep, but short enough so they\u2019re constrained and have to manage the clock. (that\u2019s how it is in real life, right?). How candidates prepare for the sessions, how they gain the respect of the team, how they own the room\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s gold, jerry, gold. 8. Back Channel Early &\u00a0Often Far too often hiring managers wait until they\u2019re nearing the end of their search to back channel references. Reputation is a huge indicator, and unlisted references will deliver in spades. \u201cHey, confidentially, what\u2019s your take on Drew Condon?\u201d is vague enough to ensure you don\u2019t expose that they might be\u00a0looking. Back channeling early will allow you to punt the less-than-stellar candidates so you can focus your energy on the top candidates. You\u2019ll need the extra effort close them anyway! 9. Hypnotize Them With\u00a0Talent Once you are down to two candidates, it\u2019s time to call in your closers. Pedro Martinez, Closing\u00a0It. I leaned on the two most impressive product leaders I know: Jeffrey Veen (True Ventures, TypeKit, Adobe) and Nate Walkingshaw (Pluralsight, Tanner Labs, Stryker) both agreed to quick interviews with our final candidates. Leaders of this caliber will provide unparalleled feedback, (\u201cThis candidate has a more contemporary approach,\u201d changed my entire thinking) but more importantly, the association alone will hypnotize candidates into wanting to \u201cstep up\u201d to the business. 10. Decide When To Pass (and\u00a0Why) As with every single hire you make, do not accept anything less than what feels like a perfect fit. If you feel unsettled. If reference checks don\u2019t ask if they can join once you hire the candidate. If people pause or caveat when you ask, \u201cwould you work with them again?\u201d Then pass. Just do it. Even if you don\u2019t have a second choice. An ineffective Head of Product will require at least 6 months recovery. 11. Hire Drew\u00a0Condon Final tip. But give us a few years with him first, ok?
