I got a little burnt out with it last year, got sidetracked into other rabbit holes, but like an affair I cannot forget, I returned to it.

What are my desired outcomes? The concept You can view the original ideas and clickable prototype here: Designing a self-directed learning network: work-in-progress v0.1core ideas, the process and an early prototypemedium.com Learning to code in order to\u00a0build Since March began I have been working full-time on this. The previous clickable prototype came to a point where the learning will not enable me to go much further on it, so I decided that building it out and eating my own dog food would teach me much more. Dennis Crowely said he learned to code for Foursquare, and this is the project I learned to code seriously for. Using jquery to make rough prototypes was the norm as a designer, but to code something from scratch is a whole other thing. Initially I experimented with using Contentful for data-entry and Vue.js to display the data. I really like what Contentful is doing as a headless CMS, but eventually I decided I couldn\u2019t decouple the creation experience from the overall user-experience. Making it easy to create cards is the whole point. Javascript has gotten both easier and harder in the last few years. For now I would say somewhat easier because I managed to get a prototype running using Vue.js and Firebase in a relatively short amount of time (1 day just for the very bare terrible minimum). This is considering that I would rate my javascript skills as non-existent though I interacted briefly with Angular. I also don\u2019t have to deal with databases and learn a backend language just to read and write data. Showing the\u00a0WIP Navigation Cards are organised into stacks. Each card can appear in multiple stacks. Cards are swipe-able on mobile and they are laid out in a simple grid on desktop. Stack & card\u00a0creation I used iframely to grab the meta data of the URL in order to automatically populate the fields: Editing Thanks to Vue and Firebase, editing cards live seem so seamless. Feature list for v0.1 of the prototype Right now it is in single-player mode, though it is set-up to ease into multi-player mode later. There are a lot of features missing\u200a\u2014\u200arearranging cards, recording progress, adding notes etc\u2014 but I thought this is a good v0.1 for a prototype. This was the list of features I planned (and completed) for this milestone: Design Apart from basic formatting to make sure it is not hideous, I didn\u2019t spend much time on the visual design. Aesthetics will not be the priority for the time being as I am focused on the product design itself, though that will evolve as I use it while I build. Code I am not proud of it right now. I intend to write a post on how I went from not knowing much javascript to building this. The hardest thing to learn for me was how data denormalization works and writing the code to make the proper calls. To be honest, I am still not sure if I am doing it right. I look forward to the day I am good enough to refactor it all. Sustenance For now, I am on the free tiers of Firebase and iframely, but there may come a point when I will need to pay for service costs, even if I fund my own time costs. I will cross that bridge when it comes. Questions These are some questions that are still up in the air: Some closing\u00a0thoughts Several times in the process of working on this, especially spending multiple days of 8 hours straight and then falling sick\u200a\u2014\u200aI wondered to myself if there is a point. I am fulfilled just by the process of making it. At this stage it I am happy to make it into my personal online library of resources, organised just the way I like to share it. There is only an opportunity cost if I am missing out on something while working on this, but I can\u2019t think of anything else I would rather be doing. There is a meta lesson here for me\u200a\u2014\u200aI am building this because in the process of building it, I had to learn a whole new ball of skills, and I thrived on it. There\u2019s very few things more satisfying (and masochistic) than spending 8 hours trying to make something work, and then see it come to life. I would have also loved to see how other people approached and learned javascript. I had to do a ton of googling\u200a\u2014\u200athere must be a better way to do this. I am also excited to apply the skills I\u2019ve picked up for this, on my other projects. I can think of a dozen things I can build with Vue and Firebase.

I intend to enable other users to create their own stack and cards in the next version, so hopefully some of you will follow this journey.
