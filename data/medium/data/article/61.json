{"content": "But Russia! How Democrats & the Accomplice Media Will Collude to Bury the Obama Unmasking Scandal Get ready for the inevitable defense of Susan Rice. This comes from Circa News: Computer logs that former President Obama\u2019s team left behind in the White House indicate his national security adviser Susan Rice accessed numerous intelligence reports during Obama\u2019s last seven months in office that contained National Security Agency intercepts involving Donald Trump and his associates, Circa has learned. Bloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake reported yesterday that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s former National Security Advisor, was the high ranking Obama official behind the unmasking of Trump associates who were \u201cincidentally\u201d monitored by the intelligence community over the past year or so. Devin Nunes, the Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman, has said that it\u2019s not so much the \u201cincidental\u201d monitoring of the Trump people that\u2019s the problem (given that there\u2019s no way to prove the Trump people weren\u2019t the targets), but rather the widespread unmasking, i.e. revealing the identities of the Trump people despite them not being the stated targets of the surveillance. That\u2019s what he was most concerned about. Lake said in his article that so long as the reports unmasked by Rice plausibly had \u201cforeign intelligence value,\u201d it\u2019s legal to unmask the names of American citizens incidentally surveilled. And he said Rice is likely on safe ground because virtually anything can be argued to have \u201cforeign intelligence value.\u201d So did those reports about the Trump people have foreign intelligence value? Nunes said no. Fox News\u2019 Adam Housley\u2019s sources from last Friday said no. And, now, this article on Circa News says no: The intelligence reports included some intercepts of Americans talking to foreigners and many more involving foreign leaders talking about the future president, his campaign associates or his transition, the sources said. Most if not all had nothing to do with the Russian election interference scandal, the sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity given the sensitive nature of the materials. Ordinarily, such references to Americans would be redacted or minimized by the NSA before being shared with outside intelligence sources, but in these cases, names were sometimes unmasked at the request of Rice or the intelligence reports were specific enough that the American\u2019s identity was easily ascertained, the sources said. Anybody with a functioning brain can easily see: It sure seems like Republicans have Rice dead to rights here. It\u2019s entirely believable that the Obama administration abused and weaponized the intelligence community against its political opponents. They did it with the IRS back in 2012, so this isn\u2019t really a surprise\u200a\u2014\u200aat least to Republicans. And, keep in mind that we\u2019re only finding all this out because of Trump\u2019s infamous March 4 \u201cWiretap\u201d tweet, where he accused Obama of \u201cwiretapping\u201d Trump Tower. That\u2019s why all this information about the Obama admin. spying on the Trump people has come out. But the problem is, it\u2019s likely Rice (and any other high-ranking Obama officials who have not yet been implicated, including even Barack Obama himself) will get away scot-free here. And it\u2019s all because of one word: Russia! That\u2019ll be Rice\u2019s defense for everything. Why did you unmask the names? Russia! Was there any foreign policy value to those reports? Russia! Why was the Trump team consistently monitored \u201cincidentally\u201d? Russia! Russia! will be Democrats\u2019 justification for everything they do. They\u2019re currently in the Denial Phase, arguing that there\u2019s no scandal here, there\u2019s no wrongdoing at all, etc. But eventually they\u2019ll move on to \u201cEverything was justified Because Russia!\u201d What\u2019s notable is that they\u2019ve backpedaled from the \u201cNunes\u2019 revelations are entirely baseless\u201d stance to the defiant posture of \u201cSusan Rice is a National Hero and was doing God\u2019s Work!\u201d The \u201cBut Russia!\u201d defensive posture is next. Even though the Russia \u201cscandal\u201d (and by scandal I mean Democrat innuendo campaign) is collapsing, and it\u2019s becoming clearer by the day that there is no there there, Democrats will keep hammering away at it, and the Accomplice Media will dutifully continue to freak out 24/7 over RUSSIA!, and steer every conversation back to RUSSSSSSSIAAAAA!!!!!!! because the Media is nakedly the propaganda/PR arm of the Democratic Party. Do you really think the \u201cmainstream\u201d media will cover this story honestly? We know it will not getting a fair shake from ABC. And CBS News\u2019 president is the brother of former Obama deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who was probably in on the Unmasking Scandal as well\u200a\u2014\u200athink about it, Rhodes was Rice\u2019s deputy on the National Security Council. It gets even better: CNN\u2019s National Security Correspondent, Jim Sciutto, was also an Obama administration political appointee. And he can triumphantly report that the Susan Rice story \u201cappears to be a story largely ginned-up, partly as a distraction\u201d from the not-ginned-up-at-all RUSSIA! investigation. So can another ultra-partisan Democrat posing as a newsman, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo (son of Democratic NY Governor Andrew Cuomo): Got that? An associate of Susan Rice says it\u2019s false, so it\u2019s 100% false. What an absolute joke of a network CNN has become. I\u2019m sure all it would take to clear Donald Trump\u2019s name in the RUSSIA! \u201cscandal\u201d is a close associate of his proclaiming his innocence. Perhaps Steve Bannon, or Ivanka, or Jared, or Donald Jr. could release a statement? I\u2019m sure that would placate CNN. And check out the New York Times\u2019 homepage from this morning, a full 24 hours or so after Eli Lake\u2019s piece ran on Bloomberg View. No mention of Susan Rice: \u201cAll the news that\u2019s fit to print\u201d? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Actually, NYT did run a story about \u201cunmasking\u201d! So maybe the Times isn\u2019t Memory Holing the entire scandal? Nevermind\u00a0:( The left-wing journalists, reporters, producers and executives that control the \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets have no interest in digging into this story and finding out the truth. They\u2019d rather no one know how high up the chain this unmasking scandal goes, so they\u2019re going to combat it. Funny how they mouth high-minded platitudes about the heroic nature of journalism as a profession, and how they are the Last Line of Defense in our Democracy, yet here we have now a major scandal unfolding implicating high-ranking members of the Obama Administration, and the media\u2019s chief concern is defending the Obama people from the accusations. So you can bet that as soon as Susan Rice comes out with a carefully worded statement citing Russia! as her reason for unmasking the names of US citizens, the New York Times and other Democratic media outlets will make that story front page news. We might even get a Sexism! defense of Rice if we\u2019re lucky. Because using the kid gloves with women is patronizing and sexist, but so is treating them just how you\u2019d treat a man. The only way you can be Not Sexist is to never criticize any (Democratic) woman ever. To the Democrats, anything is permissible in search of that ever-elusive Russia Smoking Gun. All Susan Rice must do is say the magic R-word and she\u2019ll be just fine.
