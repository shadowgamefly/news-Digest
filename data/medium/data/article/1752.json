{"name": "1752", "parent": "", "content": "How I Hacked My Perspective 3 Glass Half Full Positivity Practices. I married Captain Optimistic and his positivity used to drive me bonkers. I practiced 3 things to help me from rolling my eyes every time he seemed to spew sunshine and roses. These 3 things ended up hacking my outlook. 1. Adapt\u200a\u2014\u200aI surrounded myself with positive people and\u00a0words Positivity is not stamped on my DNA like it is my husband\u2019s. I Googled \u201cspecies adaptation\u201d and number 1 on Animal Planet\u2019s list of adaptations was: \u201cThe habit of living together in communal or family groups. Animals can derive a lot of benefit from spending time with other members of the same species. Countless species engage in group living, either in herds, colonies, harems, complex societies or loose associations. But perhaps the simplest and most common form of group living in the natural world is that of nuclear families.\u201d I had to find my \u201cpositive\u201d family, so to speak. I sought out others to find out if my husband was an anomaly. Turns out there are herds of positive people and I needed to be friends with them to help me practice a positive outlook. When my pragmatic mind kicks in they give me a nudge in the positive direction. When I decided to launch my latest business venture I borrowed the motto of my former business partner and bestie. I wrote her motto on a post-it note and stuck it on my desk: \u201cClear Your Mind of Can\u2019t.\u201d Words are powerful. I seek positive perspectives and words in conversation, I search inspirational quotes and I recently discovered this awesome card that I\u2019ll be sending to others to pay it forward: Emily McDowell\u2019s line of cards are the\u00a0bomb. 2. Habit\u200a\u2014\u200aI practice daily positivity Living with captain optimistic\u2019s glass half-full perspective has strengthened my ability to look on the bright side. But merely living with someone or surrounding yourself with those who have a positive outlook isn\u2019t enough. Create a personal positivity daily habit. Write down one good thing that happened everyday or force yourself to have an alternative thought when you feel negative thoughts ensue. I practice reframing declarative statements into questions. \u201cThere is no way we\u2019ll make that deadline.\u201d Reframe: \u201cHow can we reset expectations and work together?\u201d Simple shifts in narrative and perspective can make a world of difference. Every night I ask our boys what was your rose and thorn (best and worst part of your day). I learn so much from this and it\u2019s a simple positivity practice. It forces us all to recognize one good thing. (In case you\u2019re wondering, when Captain Optimistic is home he\u2019s only allowed 3 roses, otherwise he\u2019ll go on and on). 3. Roll with it\u200a\u2014\u200aI try to flip my perspective when having a terrible, awful, no good\u00a0day Things don\u2019t always go as planned. I\u2019ve learned to practice positivity in times of stress and life nuttiness. Practicing positivity in stressful situations helps me build resiliency. Re\u00b7sil\u00b7ient adjective (of a person or animal) able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions I run 2 businesses, have 4 boys, a dog, live on a country property and Captain Optimistic travels. Life never goes as planned. Just the other day I was squeezing into my nylons and power dress to attend a red carpet event when my babysitter discovered the toilet overflowing downstairs. Literally, shit happens. I had lined up an entire afternoon of meetings and was going to cap off the evening at the event where an important introduction was to be made. As the feeling of despair and panic at undoing my afternoon and evening ensued, I took a deep breath and said to myself \u201cFirst, let me call the plumber\u201d and then \u201cmaybe this isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Followed by, \u201cIf I\u2019m real in communicating my situation maybe the folks I have to reschedule will understand.\u201d Turns out they did understand and as I waited for the septic company to arrive, I changed my clothes and decided to change my narrative/my perspective on the situation. Turns out I had found time to check in with my boys on their school work. I read a book with my youngest son. I had an opportunity to schedule a 1:1 with the person I was to be introduced to instead of tracking him down at the crowded event. I flexed my resiliency muscle. Accepting the situation and trying to see the positive helped me roll with it. Later at the dinner table (ah, another positive, I got to have dinner with my boys) when asked what my rose and thorn was I answered, \u201cmy thorn turned into my rose.\u201d That took years of positivity practice.
