On three separate occasions this week, President Donald Trump was given an opportunity by a reporter to denounce anti-Semitism. All three times, he declined. Since ThinkProgress began tracking hate-incidents after Trump\u2019s election, we have recorded 70 instances of anti-Semitic hatred. This includes synagogues being desecrated by vandals, swastikas being scrawled onto Jewish seminaries, and 48 Jewish Community Centers in 27 states receiving bomb threats. Although the uptick in hate is impacting multiple communities, our analysis found that the largest percentage of hate instances are anti-Semitic, with anti-Jewish vitriol surging in recent weeks\u2014some of them invoking Trump\u2019s name or slogans. ThinkProgress has been tracking hate since Trump\u2019s election. Here\u2019s what we found.It disturbed us.thinkprogress.org According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the level of anti-Semitism in public and political discourse is the worst it\u2019s been since the 1930s. Yet Trump appeared to dismiss the growing issue during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. When an Israeli reporter rose to ask about the \u201csharp rise\u201d in \u201canti-Semitic incidences across the United States,\u201d Trump responded by championing his Electoral College victory. When an Israeli reporter rose to ask about the \u201csharp rise\u201d in \u201canti-semitic incidences across the United States,\u201d Trump responded by championing his Electoral College\u00a0victory. \u201cWell, I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had,\u201d he said, turning to Netanyahu. \u201c306 electoral college votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right?\u201d Trump then deflected the reporter\u2019s comment that his administration may be \u201cplaying with racist tones\u201d by citing his Jewish friends and family members. \u201cAs far as people, Jewish people, so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA son-in-law. And three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you are going to see a lot different united States of America over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening. You\u2019re going to see a lot of love. You\u2019re going to see a lot of love. Okay?\u201d At no time did Trump condemn or even directly address the surge in anti-Semitic incidents during his campaign or since his election. Netanyahu appeared to defend Trump after the question, but Israeli media characterized the president\u2019s answer as a \u201csidestep.\u201d Trump was given another opportunity to speak to the same issue the very next day at another press conference. After demanding to hear from a \u201cfriendly reporter,\u201d he pointed to Jake Turx of the Orthodox Jewish weekly Ami Magazine. Turx, wearing a traditional Jewish kippa, began his question by dismissing claims that Trump or anyone on his staff was anti-Semitic. But when he pivoted to a question about the rise in anti-Semitic attacks, things took a turn. \u201cWhat we are concerned about and what we haven\u2019t heard you address is the uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is trying to take care of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks, and there are people committing acts or threatening to\u2014\u201d Trump promptly cut Turx off, telling the journalist to \u201csit down\u201d and describing his inquiry as \u201cnot a fair question.\u201d The president then began defending himself against accusations of anti-Semitism\u2014something Turx had already addressed. \u201cNumber one, I am the least anti-Semitic person you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNumber two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did really well relative to other people running as a Republican.\u201d When Turx attempted to interject that he was only referring to the rise in hate incidents and not Trump himself, the president silenced him. \u201cQuiet, quiet, quiet,\u201d he said, gesticulating at Turx. \u201cHe lied that he was going to get up and ask a straight, simple question, so, you know, welcome to the world of the media.\u201d Trump concluded by referencing Netanyahu\u2019s support for him, and deriding Turx\u2019s inquiry a \u201cvery insulting question.\u201d Later in the same press conference, another reporter attempted\u2014for a third time\u2014to push Trump to answer the same question. \u201cI\u2019d just like to follow-up on my colleague\u2019s question about anti-Semitism,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s not about your personality or your beliefs, we\u2019re talking about a rising anti-Semitism around the country, some by supporters in your name\u2014\u201d But Trump once again cut off the reporter, claiming\u2014without evidence\u2014that some hate incidents committed by Trump supporters were actually committed by his opponents. \u201cCan I be honest with you?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it [is] written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that?\u201d \u201cSome of the signs you see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they\u2019re put up by the other side,\u201d he added. Trump provided no proof to back his claim. But there is evidence to support concern over anti-Semitism inspired by his political career: His candidacy and presidency have been endorsed by prominent anti-Semites such as Richard Spencer and former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. Jewish groups were quick to express outrage over Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to answer simple questions about anti-Semitism. \u201cIt is honestly mind-boggling why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL\u2019s national director, said in a statement. American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris was similarly frustrated by the president\u2019s non-response. \u201cInstead of answering a timely and legitimate question, the president chose instead to besmirch the reporter,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cRespectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of Americans, but rather to help solve a problem that, for many, is real and menacing.\u201d Despite the outcry, recent history suggests it is difficult to push Trump to speak out forcefully against anti-Semitism. People claiming to support Trump harassed Jewish reporters throughout his campaign\u2014including here at ThinkProgress\u2014sometimes even sending death threats to those who wrote pieces critical of him or his family. Trump supporters were also recorded shouting, \u201cGo to fucking Auschwitz!\u201d as they left his rallies, and his own speech to Republican Jews was decried as riddled with Jewish stereotypes. When Trump was asked by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer to comment on his anti-Semitic supporters the campaign, however, he said he didn\u2019t know enough to comment. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to them about it,\u201d he said.
