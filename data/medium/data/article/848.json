You want to wake up early\u2026 but your bed is so warm\u2026 and you snooze one time and another\u00a0\u2026 you feel good in that moment but a complete shit after. It\u2019s easy to fail on things that don\u2019t bring you any punishment. You wake up late, you never workout, you never talks to a girl, you never work on your side project after work, you never change your diet\u2026 the years pass and guess what happen? Nothing happen\u2026 Sad but true\u00a0\u2026 Nothing will happen\u2026 the punishment is just nights wasted on Netflix and video games. Don\u2019t expect any pain\u00a0\u2026 The only thing is that you will not feel greatness and that\u2019s all. But you will not feel bad because you never taste it. You will be in the same spot year after year and call it a life. Your brain want you to be safe\u00a0.. not happy\u00a0.. will give you thousands of good justifications why it\u2019s ok. So if there is no \u201cdirect\u201d punishment for our lack of action what should we do to get some extra motivation to change? I will teach you a little trick I did to start to wake up every day at 6 AM\u200a\u2014\u200a7 AM and it works really well for me. This trick looks stupid but it just works. What did was told to my\u00a0brother: Dude I want to wake up every day at 6 AM. During 44 days ( I read somewhere that was a time we need to build a habit). If I fail more than 4 times I will give you 100\u20ac if I don\u2019t fail you don\u2019t have to give me anything. Of course, he accepts the offer really fast.\u00a0Nothing to lose? HELL YEAH! Easiest 100\u20ac of my life. During first 11 days I fail 4 times to get up at 6 AM. I remember to feel really bad. My brain starts to give me reasons to give up. \u201cIf I don\u2019t sleep I will have problems blah blah blah\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to lose the money. After that 11 days, I get up 33 days at 6 AM straight. Not a single fail. And to be honest, after 20 ~ 25 days it\u2019s easy, you don\u2019t even think about it. It makes part of you. That initial external pressure helped me to build discipline. Nowadays, even if I fail sometimes I have enough discipline to apply changes in my life. And actually, i fall in love with the process of slowly getting better. So my advice is if you don\u2019t feel that you have enough inner power to do it alone, tell everyone you will do it. Make bets with someone that you are sure will ask you the money if you fail. Make sure you put an amount you don\u2019t wanna lose. Another idea: Quit Smoking?\u00a0Open your facebook and Instagram and post there. I will stop\u00a0smoking. Public commitment is a great idea. If someone comment \u201c You can\u2019t do it!\u201d Show them that they are WRONG! Maybe you will tell me: OH, Carlos but that\u2019s so stupid, you will bet with someone to act has your parent and pressure you. You should do the things because you want to not because you have external pressure. Yeah, thats a great concept but that\u2019s not true until you have some discipline. Your parent\u2019s force you to shower, to study, to clean your room.Your boss force to finish your work faster.\u00a0Your bills force to work on that shitty job you\u00a0hate. And you are telling me that you don\u2019t need external pressure to do something that you are not forced to do it and don\u2019t give you immediate results? Think again.
