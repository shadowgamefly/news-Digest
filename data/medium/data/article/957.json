I will remember all the long, lonely nights that I marched alone. I will remember all of those I marched with, long before you decided to arrive. I will remember all those I marched for, long before you decided to acknowledge them. I will remember marching away from my school, my home, my family, my entire lifestyle, into a vast unknown that challenged every aspect of my being, marching toward what I believed in. I will remember you saying marching was too far out of your comfort zone. I will remember the many hours I marched, through parking lots, grocery stores, campuses, parks, hot summer events, and downtown streets, registering every person I found. I will remember the many miles I marched, door to door, pleading with people to march themselves to the polls. I will remember you were too busy, it was too rainy, too hot, too cold, for you to march with me. I will remember marching through neighborhoods of people depending on the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. I will remember you were too \u201cuncomfortable\u201d there to march with me. I will remember dreaming of a women\u2019s march on January 20th, with one woman who told the world women\u2019s rights are human rights before you claimed it as your truth. I will remember you insisting she was too flawed, too stuffy, and too off putting to march for. I will remember marching against a man who spoke approvingly of sexual assault. I will remember you deciding, on your moral high ground, you could not march for someone who messed up her emails. I will remember pleading with you, begging you, imploring you to march with me because our outcome was not certain. I will remember you saying Nate Silver told you marching was unnecessary. I will remember asking you to march. I will remember you did not. I will not march with you, I\u2019ve already marched.
