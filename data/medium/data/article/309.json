{"name": "309", "parent": "", "content": "30 Things About Life I Wish I Had Known 10 Years\u00a0Ago Last week I turned 30. Unlike most people, I do like getting older. 10 years ago, I was a complete idiot. Now, a decade later, I still know nothing, but I do feel more in control of my life. I thank that personal growth to an idea I stole from Socrates, the person who was once named the wisest man on earth by the Oracle of Delphi. When Socrates heard that the oracle had made such a comment, he believed that the statement was wrong. Socrates said: \u201cI know one thing: that I know nothing.\u201d How can the smartest man on earth know nothing? I heard this paradoxical wisdom for the first time from my school teacher when I was 14 or 15. That humility made such an impact on me that I used Socrates\u2019s quote as my learning strategy. What you will find below is a list of the most important things I learned from others. We might learn things quickly, but we often forget things at the same rate\u200a\u2014\u200aand sometimes we need to remind ourselves of the things we\u2019ve learned. Here are 30 of those reminders that others taught me. You might know a lot. But like Socrates, you and I know nothing at all. So we have to keep learning. Thanks for reading!
