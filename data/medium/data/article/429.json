Strands of lights twinkled overhead, though the women arrived for the fete before sundown, toting husbands, boyfriends, and partners\u2014witnesses to their entrepreneurial success. It was early March and warm in Costa Rica, the perfect weather for the final dinner of Stella & Dot\u2019s \u201cGlam Getaway trip\u201d\u2014a reward for some 400 of the jewelry and accessories company\u2019s top sellers, called \u201cstylists\u201d in company lingo. These stylists sell the company\u2019s ear cuffs and statement necklaces independently, either through their personal networks on Instagram and Facebook or at trunk shows, hosted at the homes of friends and acquaintances. These women (and they\u2019re almost all women) are powering a digital age reinvention of direct sales companies like Avon and Mary Kay, minus the slog of selling door to door. Follow Backchannel: Facebook |\u00a0Twitter In the 14 years since Jessica Herrin began making jewelry on her living room floor, Stella & Dot has grown into a global operation with 400 full-time employees, routinely grossing $300 million in annual sales. The main brand, focused on accessories, has over 30,000 stylists; its offshoot brands\u2014KEEP Collective, which sells charms, and EVER, which sells organic skincare\u2014add another 20,000 independent sellers. The company is enough of an innovator that Sequoia Capital courted Herrin to invest $37 million in 2011, valuing the company at $370 million. \u201cJessica never needed to raise money,\u201d says Alfred Lin, the Sequoia partner who led the investment. \u201cThe investors have always knocked on her door, like, \u2018How do we invest in this company.\u2019\u201d Herrin is in many ways an investor\u2019s dream: a dot com veteran with tech bonafides, including stints at Dell and Trilogy and a prior successful startup. She is the rare female founder among a high-powered cohort that all graduated from Stanford in early \u201890s,* including men like Peter Thiel (who received his JD in 1992) and early PayPal COO David Sacks, as the New York Times noted in a profile. Voice Is the Next Big Platform, Unless You Have an AccentIt\u2019s super funny that Alexa can\u2019t understand my mom\u200a\u2014\u200auntil we need Alexa to use the web, drive a car, and do pretty\u2026backchannel.com Asked about her success, Herrin told the Times, \u201cI\u2019ve never tried to sit at the boys\u2019 table.\u201d That may, in fact, be her secret. In a world of Airbnbs and Snapchats and Dollar Shave Clubs, Stella & Dot is the kind of successful tech startup that tends to get overlooked. It\u2019s women-led and women-focused, and therefore half invisible to the techies of Silicon Valley. Yet Herrin has managed to tap into a brutally underserved market: the tens of thousands of women around the country who are fueled by an unfulfilled entrepreneurial zeal and are in need of part-time work. They don\u2019t have the time or energy to start their own companies, nor do they want to rough it in the dregs of the gig economy, shuttling food for Instacart or driving for Lyft. They want to be a part of something bigger\u2014something with purpose. This idea of empowerment by entrepreneurism is baked into Stella & Dot\u2019s mission statement, coined by Herrin and printed on everything from the website to the office wall: \u201cTo give every woman the means to style her own life.\u201d To many of Stella & Dot\u2019s stylists, Herrin has taken on the role of a cult figure\u200a\u2014\u200athe endlessly stylish, unflappably inspiring CEO who understands the desire to lean kinda-sorta in. So for those top sellers who earned trips to Costa Rica, it was access to Herrin, not the tropical paradise, that was the real prize. She zip-lined with the \u201cStyle Council Elite,\u201d the troop of power sellers who earn as much as $20,000 per month in commissions, and she led a toast to the sales reps by the pool. When the dinner finished with a dance party, there was Herrin on the dance floor. She has reason to celebrate. Herrin has managed to take the old, tarnished model of direct sales, long known for luring participants with empty promises of wealth, and recasting it as \u201csocial selling,\u201d a lucrative, almost glamorous byproduct of the social media age. Stella & Dot\u2019s headquarters sit in a vast, drab office park in San Francisco\u2019s South Bay, right off of a Brisbane highway. Inside, however, it\u2019s highly \u2019grammable, from the white fuzzy benches that line the conference room and the gold-rimmed marble coasters, to a large brass light fixture jutting out in abstract lines over the table. \u201cHello Gorgeous\u201d\u2014a company slogan that\u2019s also printed inside many of their jewelry boxes\u2014greets visitors from scripted neon lights that hang across from the elevator. We like you as you are, it seems to say. When I visited in late February, it was still an open construction site: Men with drills were installing what will soon be a showcase wall for products. The leadership team, however, was sequestered in the conference room, ignoring the racket, at a strategy meeting designing marketing for Stella & Dot\u2019s spring line. Including Herrin, 11 women sat on brass-and-black-leather chairs around the table, each one wearing slim jeans, silky tops, and decorous statement jewelry. (A single man, also wearing jeans, spent the meeting quietly typing\u200a\u2014\u200aprojecting sales into a spreadsheet while the women spoke.) Herrin, who paired her denim with a washed out tee and long cardigan, was quick to crack jokes about her appearance. Most days she rises at 5 am to complete the daily runs that keep her lean and energized. But today, with one child home sick with strep throat, she hadn\u2019t had time to shower. Tired looks different on Herrin, who for the most part stood during the three-hour-plus meeting, pacing the room to write on a whiteboard or crouching close to an employee to make a point. Google\u2019s Plan to Engineer the Next Silicon ValleysThe tech giant is quietly grooming companies overseas in a strategic move to bring the next billion online.backchannel.com Frequently, she addressed the room Socratic-style, using open-ended questions to guide the group towards an obvious answer. At stake: how to roll out a promo of hostess points, the rewards used to offer free jewelry to the party planners, who provide the space and audience for trunk shows\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially, expanding the stylists\u2019 sales network. She paused. \u201cThe other thing we need to remember,\u201d Herrin asked the room, \u201cis what\u2019s the number one reason people host?\u201d \u201cDeals?\u201d someone tentatively suggested. Herrin wrinkled her nose. \u201cStyle, fun, social,\u201d another offered. \u201cBingo. It\u2019s about style and connection rather than deals,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t wanna feel like they\u2019re making rewards off of their friends.\u201d Except, of course, that\u2019s what Stella & Dot\u2019s stylists do: They sell to the branches of friends and acquaintances and neighbors in their network. These networks have grown exponentially larger thanks to the internet, which allows them to target people outside of their home towns. That\u2019s part of why a modern wave of direct sales companies is thriving, from LuLaRoe (trademark leggings and clothes), to Scentsy (candles), to Rodin and Fields (skin care). According to the Direct Selling Association, the number of participants in direct sales businesses jumped by just under 30 percent between 2012 and 2015\u200a\u2014\u200awith almost 20 million people participating in a direct sales company. Jessica Herrin. (Courtesy of Stella &\u00a0Dot) Still, this modern cohort has to work to shed the poor reputation of its predecessors. Herbalife, an infamous direct sales supplement company, is currently settling a lawsuit with over 300,000 people who lost money attempting to run a business. To hear the lasting damages of Mary Kay, you can just saunter over to the Pink Truth message board, where ex-reps share their warnings about working with the company. Survivors of wayward direct sales businesses have similar complaints: It takes a large buy-in to gather supplies to start selling. Because anyone is allowed to start a branch, often the market is oversaturated. The only way to make money, critics say, is to sign on new participants and take a cut of their sales. And unlike traditional retail jobs, if sales go south, you don\u2019t make money. Several times during my visit, Herrin shrugged off my label of direct sales. \u201cI have never thought of us as direct sales. I think of us as innovative social selling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re driving acquisition through social media. We just use the networks of our sellers.\u201d To shake off those unwanted associations, the company pours effort into setting the right tone with its stylists\u200a\u2014\u200alike you\u2019re just attending a party of a fun, girly friend, not absorbing a hard-line sales pitch. The answer, for the most part, is making selling jewelry feel like it\u2019s about more than just jewelry. It\u2019s also why Herrin, with absolutely no irony, said to me at one point: \u201cWe are a movement, we are a movement of people who believe that there should be this community that lifts women up.\u201d At the end of the meeting, Herrin asked the staff to evaluate their message. Most everyone thought there was something missing. It needed more \u201cempowerment sharing\u201d and \u201cmission messages.\u201d The line copy needed to \u201cfeel emotional.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still missing some sparkle,\u201d someone suggested. How the Internet Gave Mail-Order Brides the PowerRural Filipinas have flipped the dating script: Now they\u2019re the ones shopping for Western men.backchannel.com After the meeting, Herrin decamped to her office to put on makeup and change her clothes before filming \u201cThe Buzz,\u201d a weekly Facebook video going over new products and techniques that airs to their sales field. She dragged a hairbrush through her hair, which immediately began to resemble a fresh blowout. She changed from the sweater into a sleek suede jacket. Stella & Dot products, she told me, should be versatile. \u201cOur motto is that every woman, she puts it on, it fits, it flatters.\u201d So, you can wear the Starburst Ear Jacket ($49) four ways: with a pearl stud, with a clear crystal stud, or either of the studs alone. The strands of most statement necklaces unclasp to create individual delicate strands. The Getaway bag expands to fit extra luggage and contracts to squeeze into the stowaway compartment of a plane. In that way, Herrin explained, Stella & Dot\u2019s accessories are an easier lift than fashion or makeup\u200a\u2014\u200athey come in to elevate a look, not make or break it. To promo the Facebook video, she shot an Instagram post, highlighting a delicate bracelet embroidered in India. A colleague posed Herrin\u2019s hand draped just-so over her knee. She snapped 15 photos with her iPhone and handed it over, but Herrin thought they looked weird. Herrin fanned her hand to a more natural position. They took another few dozen pictures until they got a winning shot. The first thing you should know about Herrin is she takes after her father. Early on in Find Your Extraordinary, a biography-slash-motivational book that Herrin published in 2016, she mentions her dad, a perennial optimist with an entrepreneur\u2019s spirit, who raised her with minimal coddling but a whole lot of support. The next thing she wants to tell you is about her mother, who was bipolar and unhappy. She left Herrin when she was young. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel like she had options,\u201d Herrin told me, sitting in her office. Early on Herrin decided: her life would be different. \u201cI was always going to be able to make my own choices. Work when I wanted to work. Support myself.\u201d The other thing Herrin wants you to know is life doesn\u2019t come as easy as it looks on her resume. She didn\u2019t just saunter into Stanford for her undergrad: She waitressed while attending a community college and transferred. Her first business, the Wedding Channel, which she launched by dropping out of Stanford business school, only came together after hard work and chutzpah-infused strategy. Though she\u2019d never been particularly interested in retail, while working at the Wedding Channel she\u2019d put herself through a study of department stores. \u201cTraditional distribution models have a lot of overhead,\u201d she told me. \u201cOn that food chain, not everyone is happy.\u201d Tech\u2019s Harassment Crisis Now Has an Arsenal of Smoking GunsFour years after #Donglegate, we\u2019re finally ready to believe women.backchannel.com Herrin\u2019s ah-ha moment happened during a business trip to Dallas, where she was negotiating a deal with Neiman Marcus. The hotel she was staying in was hosting a conference for Mary Kay, the direct sales cosmetics company founded in the \u201960s. On the way to her room, she happened to share an elevator with a cluster of top sellers, dressed in the signature Pepto Bismol pink, bursting with pride from the awards ceremony. \u201cIn that moment, in that elevator,\u201d she writes in her book, \u201cI could feel that the company was about so much more than makeup; it had been an on-ramp into the workforce for these women.\u201d Before the elevator run-in, Herrin told me in her office, her connection to women\u2019s work had been accidental. She\u2019d launched the Wedding Channel not because of the connection to the bridal industry, but because she saw an opening for a price aggregator. But the Mary Kay model made sense to Herrin. \u201cIt spoke so much to what, in my own childhood, had gone wrong for the women that were or were not in my life,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf I could be part of the next chapter of flexible work for women, then it would really be about being in the people business and the happiness business.\u201d Shortly after, she left her job at the Wedding Channel to move with her husband to Texas. She wanted to have kids, so they prioritized his career for a stretch. She took a middle management job at Dell. But the reprieve didn\u2019t last very long. Soon she was attending beading conventions and making jewelry at night with an eye toward rebranding the Mary Kay model. Herrin, right, and her cofounder Blythe Harris, left. (Courtesy of Stella &\u00a0Dot) As she researched the direct sales industry, she found the dominant sales techniques alienating. \u201c[It was] very male, very persistent,\u201d she told me, \u201cand not in a way that I thought you were going to get a lot of women confident in selling.\u201d Women, Herrin believes, are natural sellers, but they sell using subtler techniques, through recommendations. I just used a new eyeliner that didn\u2019t crease. The restaurant we ate at had the best sushi. I just saw this new movie and boy, was it a tear jerker. Herrin launched her idea as if starring in a parody video of a thinly resourced Silicon Valley startup. She made the jewelry. She built the website. She went door to door selling it. \u201cI wanted to believe in the experience enough to be my own venture capitalist and back it with my blood, sweat, tears, and savings,\u201d she told me. \u201cI just asked people who they knew and asked those people who they knew, and one turned into two turned into three turned into 50,000.\u201d The business solidified in 2007, when she met her cofounder Blythe Harris, a jewelry designer for Banana Republic, at a Stanford alumni event. Together, the pair rebranded the company under the Stella & Dot name\u200a\u2014\u200aeach name drawn from their grandmothers. Soon celebrities were wearing the line, and it was gracing editorials in magazines like O and Cosmopolitan. Yet the real buzz was generated by the labyrinth of women bringing the jewelry into their friends\u2019 homes to sell it. That is how, on a recent Sunday afternoon, I found myself in Jessica Sigler\u2019s bright midtown Manhattan apartment, with views stretching south and west. A group of women, mostly in their 30s, mingled over a spread of bite-sized banana bread, teensy mini-blueberry muffins, and three-bite frittatas, which Sigler\u2019s husband had prepared the night before. Sigler joined Stella & Dot after working as a tax accountant in D.C. Unhappy with her job and looking for a change, she quit and followed her then-boyfriend to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was attending business school. There, she was unemployed and looking for something to occupy her time. An acquaintance suggested Stella & Dot. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bunch of uneducated, \u2018I have nothing else to do, I\u2019m a stay at home mom,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cI mean that in the nicest way, but these were very well-educated, professional women that chose to do this.\u201d Five years later, Sigler is still working for Stella & Dot, where 25 hours a week nets her five to seven thousand a month. That\u2019s in addition to the time spent babysitting and tutoring for an Upper East Side parent\u2014\u201cto get into the mommy demographic,\u201d she says. Wearing a grey sweater, artfully distressed denim, and a shocking pair of glittery ear cuffs, Sigler looks like a Pinterest photo of off-duty chic\u2014exactly the sort of person you would trust to create your look. And her friends do. One of the women shows her a photo of a recent purchase, a Rag and Bone jumpsuit, looking for styling tips. Sigler suggests a pair of deep navy tassel earrings. Or, perhaps a set of gold ear cuffs. \u201cThey\u2019re $49, but you can wear them two ways,\u201d she chortles, \u201cso it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Sigler has found that the best marketer of the lines is her own body\u200a\u2014\u200awhich just happens to be petite and blond. She doesn\u2019t sell to drunk people, but when she goes to bars, she brings along pamphlets with her stylist page for when people ask after her earrings. She\u2019s sold one particularly cute cut-out tote bag to the passenger sitting next to her on a plane. \u201cI mean, the sale is meant to happen, but it\u2019s going to happen organically,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen because I force a piece on you.\u201d It\u2019s true: At her trunk show, everyone ends up buying something, with most purchasing in excess of $200. Sigler does give good advice. At one point, I ask what she would suggest for\u2026say, a 31-year-old writer who works in a mostly male industry looking to feel more powerful in her wardrobe. Just in theory. The usual answer\u2014the answer I\u2019ve come to expect from copious fashion magazines\u2014is a statement necklace. Siegler swerves: She suggests an earring. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s championing a necklace then you do a chunky earring,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think that would make you feel a little bit less uniformly and a little bit different.\u201d True. At one point, she confides in me that styling makes her feel good about herself. \u201cIt makes you feel special, and like you\u2019re actually doing something and you\u2019re\u2026I don\u2019t want to think like changing lives, but, you know. You\u2019re helping women feel better.\u201d Herrin believes she\u2019s the architect of a company that works according to her values: The harder you work, the larger your paycheck. It\u2019s the opposite of how work life manifests for most women, who find that the higher they climb up the totem pole, the larger the gap in pay. Work hard at Stella & Dot, however, and you get a free trip to Costa Rica, Herrin says. \u201cYou get recognition. You get to walk across a stage.\u201d She articulated her philosophy at length in Find Your Extraordinary. It debuted at number two on the Wall Street Journal bestsellers list, and has garnered close to perfect reader reviews on Amazon and Goodreads, largely from women who are inspired by Herrin\u2019s message of agency. While other lady tech icons advise strategic maneuvering around the boys club, Herrin advises a more can-do approach. Her advice on sexism: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let the world zap you of your confidence or positivity. I like to assume the world is awaiting my success\u200a\u2014\u200aand you should too.\u201d Herrin knows exactly how to turn that sensibility into corporate strategy. A few days after Stephanie Swobody, a newly recruited stylist, achieved the Star ranking just one month into her stint with Stella & Dot, she found a Facebook message from Herrin in her inbox: Welcome to Stella & Dot and WOW just WOW on your rocket ship to Star. Way to go, You are a total badass and I can\u2019t wait to see what you do next! It\u2019s YOUR company- wouldn\u2019t be without you, and I hope it serves you in a way that goes beyond your expectations. 37 days to star- that is AH MAH ZING! I can\u2019t wait to meet you in person! Swobody was awestruck. Not only was she being recognized, but she was being called out directly by the CEO. \u201cI\u2019ve never held a job where if you work hard you truly get paid more for it,\u201d she told me. Other stylists told me that the work philosophy is what makes selling so pleasant. Nichole Di Modica, a stylist who used to run global operations for Mary Kate and Ashley Olson, says that even at her corporate job, \u201cnever have I felt so much joy in my work.\u201d Another stylist, Tina Gibbons, told me she kept coming back to direct sales, even as several of the companies she sold for folded. She missed the female companionship when she wasn\u2019t selling. To get to a conference, for example, \u201cwe packed seven people in an SUV and drove to Minnesota together, and by the end of a six- or seven-hour drive, we knew everyone\u2019s life stories.\u201d Her group shared a hotel room, packing air mattresses across the floor. \u201cHere you\u2019re a 30- or 40-year-old woman, and you\u2019re doing things you did when you were in your 20s,\u201d she said. A part of me is filled with longing at the idea of Gibbons\u2019 girl gang at their middle-aged sleepover. It seems like a vision of a utopian workplace, one that is built for women, that bends to fit their personalities and needs. The reality is, most of these women will never start their own business, but climbing the ranks of a pre-made company allows them to breathe in some of the sparkle-dust fumes of Herrin\u2019s enterprise. It may not be everything I\u2019d wish for them\u2014I want them to climb to the top of a company through their intellect rather than their ability to recruit; I want them to find flexible work that pays for sick days and slow sales months. It\u2019s not perfect. But to the women who believe in Herrin, it\u2019s everything. Or, at the very least, it will do. About 10 minutes after we got off the phone, Gibbons followed up with an email. \u201cI would love to set you up as an online S&D hostess! Better yet, if you are looking for a killer opportunity, I\u2019m your gal! It\u2019s the best side job you will ever have and I\u2019m pretty fun to work with, if do say so myself!! \ud83d\ude09\u201d An earlier version of this story stated that Peter Thiel graduated from Stanford in 1994.

But the Mary Kay model made sense to Herrin. \u201cIt spoke so much to what, in my own childhood, had gone wrong for the women that were or were not in my life,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf I could be part of the next chapter of flexible work for women, then it would really be about being in the people business and the happiness business.\u201d"}, {"2fa0": "Shortly after, she left her job at the Wedding Channel to move with her husband to Texas.
