It\u2019s become such a curse, it\u2019s a shame, an embarrassment to need someone. Why. We want to be needed but we don\u2019t want to need. Vulnerability is a dirty feeling, like insecurity and failure. It\u2019s the newest taboo. No one will admit to disappointment. No one wants their imperfections shown. What a waste. Who will step forward and say, \u201cI need something. I need you. I am confused and helpless at times and you heal me. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s you that I need.\u201d I need you. You and your no fucks given. There\u2019s no appeal in that for me. I have lots of fucks to give. I care too much, too quickly, too fervently. Can you imagine there is such a thing as loving too much? Loving too much! I love too much! It\u2019s a curse! It\u2019s a shame! I am humiliated by my wanting. I don\u2019t want your rehearsed sex, with your props and your disengaged urgency. I don\u2019t need batteries and gadgets. Don\u2019t swing me from ceilings. Don\u2019t tie me up in ropes. Use your hands, use your lips, use your spit, use your imagination. Breathe on me. You and your twisted porn. Your glowing screen. Your vibrators and videos. Buy now! Cum now! No kissing! No undressing! Look away from my eyes! No needing! Self-sufficient! No strings! No Feelings! No Regrets! No fucks given! No love. You and your artificial risk of handcuffs and chains. Your fake danger in whips and wax. Pretend slavery and pretend submission. Your gags, your safe words and costumes. It\u2019s your need for safety is what it is. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s scared. Hiding behind your kinks and costumes. Protected. You know what\u2019s risky? Loving completely. You know what\u2019s dangerous? Needing someone without guarantees. You know what\u2019s scary? Not knowing what happens next. Will I ever be loved? You\u2019re a coward with your practiced indifference. You\u2019re an actor playing house, like an amusement park character assigned duties of sex and dinners. Scripted conversation. But you never stay to clean up the trash, open the rides, repair and replace the squeaky gears. You don\u2019t know how hard it is to carry the weight. You don\u2019t know how beautiful it is when the park is empty with the sun rising. You go home too soon. You\u2019re a mannequin, a robot. You\u2019ve abandoned your heart. Traded it in for security and assurance, sold it for a guarantee. You\u2019ve got your rules and requirements. You have checklists and criteria. You have your ego and your walls. I don\u2019t need your vacant stares; your clever texts, your discipline. I don\u2019t need your distance. I need your reckless abandon, your over-sharing, your lust and your wanting. Talk to me. Give me sensual anarchy. Give me lawless love. Take away the restraints. I\u2019m giving in, I\u2019m giving up, I\u2019m giving everything. Just your skin and mine. Undressed, touching with every inch, sweating, breathing, eyes locking, stinking like passion and wanting. Let it kill me.
