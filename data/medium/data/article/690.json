{"name": "690", "parent": "", "content": "Tools as a catalyst for culture\u00a0change Over the past two and a half years, I\u2019ve led a project at IBM that deployed a new set of tools to help improve the company\u2019s product development efforts. What is the benefit of providing better tools to employees? A first answer is that it helps increase employee productivity. While this is true and part of the answer, it is much too narrow. The broader answer is that giving employees great tools is an excellent way to concretely affect positive culture change. In this article I\u2019ll summarize what the team did and what I learned. A quick summary of the\u00a0project A few years ago, my part of IBM shifted its software delivery model from on premises to as-a-service [1]. To do this well, you must be able to rapidly evolve your service based on your changing understanding of user needs, while ensuring excellent operational quality \u2013 always on, always fast, always secure. Teams that excel at this tend to use a set of practices that we capture under the umbrella term of \u201ccontinuous delivery\u201d [2]. In late 2013 and early 2014, I led a project called \u201cIBM Service Engage\u201d that eventually (after I left) grew into the IBM Marketplace [3]. One of the reasons the Service Engage project was successful was because we were good at continuous delivery, having studied and emulated how the best continuous delivery companies like Etsy and Netflix worked. A critical contributor to our success was that we built a good, modern continuous delivery \u201ctoolchain\u201d that included a good git-based source control system, a good continuous integration engine, a good continuous deployment system, and good monitoring and alerting tools. When our CEO Ginni Rometty hired Jeff Smith as IBM\u2019s CIO, with the mandate to help IBM achieve better business and technical agility, I proposed to Jeff that we provide the entire company with a great continuous delivery toolchain that fostered radical collaboration across disciplines. Jeff agreed and for the past two and a half years, that\u2019s what my team and I have been working on. We chose and deployed best-of-breed collaboration tools like Slack and Mural, and best-of-breed continuous delivery tools like GitHub Enterprise and Travis CI to continously deploy their services to the IBM cloud. About a year into the project, we\u2019d seen some amazing uptake, but we\u2019d also realized that providing great tools was a means to an end, but not the real goal. A fool with a tool is still a fool\u00a0[4] About a year into the project, we realized that we had three distinct internal market segments: By now, some of you have probably realized that we were simply observing the normal \u201cdiffusion of innovations\u201d adoption curve. By Everett Rogers [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons Hindsight bias says \u201cthis should have been obvious\u201d. Fine. What I believe wasn\u2019t obvious then \u2013 and remains non-obvious now \u2013 was that tool adoption was not the real problem to solve. The real problem to solve was getting teams to discover and adopt the modern practices that the tools enabled. The tools we picked all had good surface usability \u2013 attractive UIs, good performance, etc. \u2013 but the magic was in the new workflows and collaborations that they enabled. For instance, you can use GitHub as just a more attractive Git UI, but it becomes magical when you fully buy into its pull request workflow to support peer reviews and social coding across teams. As another example, you can use Slack as simply a more attractive instant message client, but it becomes magical when it becomes the cockpit for your human colleagues and continuous delivery tools to collaborate on updating a production application. The magic is in the new, better practices that the tools enable. A tool is a vehicle for practices. Practices directly shape habits and tacit assumptions. Habits and tacit assumptions are the foundations of culture. We realized that our early adopters typically had learned both the tools and the better practices in some previous context. The laggards were, well, the laggards. We decided to focus our energies on the early majority, who wanted to do better, and saw the tools as key ingredient for this, but were missing the critical insight that the tools were the vehicles for new, better practices which they would need to learn and ultimately master. With this new understanding we developed and adopted a new mission statement: We help teams learn, adapt, and apply modern product delivery practices in order to deliver great outcomes. We use technology to drive the adoption and mastery of modern practices at scale. Tools as a catalyst for culture\u00a0change From the last section, one might draw the conclusion that \u201ctools are an implementation detail.\u201d This is completely wrong. Tools are critically important for many reasons, but especially these two: Hopefully the first bullet is obvious by now. To explain the second bullet, I\u2019ll share a fun and analogous story. A friend of mine is CTO at a company that is respected in the industry for its healthy culture and excellent modern continuous delivery practices. A few years ago, his boss, the CEO, walked into his office and posed an unusual question: \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to spend 15 minutes with President Obama to provide recommendations on how he should fix HealthCare.gov. What would you say?\u201d This was right after the original launch that most observers had considered a disaster. There were a myriad of problems, and many of them ran deep \u2013 to the culture of the organization creating the system. My friend said \u201cSuggest to President Obama that the team should deploy to production every day.\u201d When I first heard this story, I laughed, because it seemed so simplistic \u2013 especially when you\u2019re talking to the leader of the free world. But as I thought more about it, I came to understood the genius of it. It is genius, because it is a very concrete, measurable recommendation that you can only achieve if you solve hundreds of problems, small and large, ranging from technical, to practice, to policy, to culture. If he had instead said \u201cLet\u2019s talk about changing your culture,\u201d it might have resulted in a stimulating and thought-provoking 15 minute conversation, but would have failed to have any concrete impact. Deploying great tools to your company has a similar, concrete effect, that acts as a catalyst for positive culture change. It\u2019s all well and good for a leader to stand up and say \u201cwe want you to adopt DevOps culture\u201d or \u201cwe want you to become great at continuous delivery\u201d, but these statements are fuzzy and hand-wavey. It\u2019s a very different thing for a leader to say \u201cyou now all have access to Slack, GitHub Enterprise, Travis CI, and Safari Books Online to support your adoption of DevOps culture and continuous delivery.\u201d I think of tools as a catalyst because \u2013 if you manage to communicate and execute well [5] \u2013 you can set off a positive chain reaction: Some important details It\u2019s hard to compress two and a half years of experience into an article, but what I described above is the gist of what I learned. Before closing, I thought I\u2019d share list some important details that support the above approach. Picking the right tools We did not perform thorough analysis to select the early tools, yet they\u2019ve been wildly successful inside IBM. Did we get lucky? Nope \u2013 the secret is that we had good taste in who we followed [6]. One major lesson I\u2019ve learned from our IBM CIO Jeff Smith is \u201cfind what best looks like, and learn from it\u201d [7]. We looked around the company and around the tech industry for people who we thought were \u201cdoing it right\u201d and simply asked them what tools they were using and why. Some tools and practices kept coming up again and again, with compelling success stories, so we went for those. Two years into the project, with some more experience under my belt, I distilled a balanced scorecard based approach to provide a more rigorous set of assessment criteria, in support the \u201cfind what best looks like\u201d principle [8]. Building an \u201carmy of awesome\u201d We discovered very early in the project that we could leverage diffusion effects to accelerate adoption and amplify our small team\u2019s impact. Specifically, we identified key communities and opinion leaders within those communities, who would advocate for our tools and act as local sources of support. One such community was the IBM front-end development, or FED community. This was a thriving community of practice that was populated by top developers from around the company who cared deeply about designing and building delightful and modern web experiences for their respective products. The leaders of this community immediately loved our project because we made it safe and possible to use the same modern tools for their day jobs that they were already using for their non-IBM nights-and-weekends projects. As an intra-IBM community they shared best practices with each other, and educated newer community members. Within their particular business units, they advocated for the new tools and practices, and became existence proofs that it was possible to use these tools and practices within IBM, even if it was quite different than what had come before. Fostering continuous learning One risk of a strong internal community is that you may become cut off from improvements in the world outside your company. One of the underlying premises of Jeff\u2019s \u201cfind what best looks like\u201d principle is that in a world with more than 6 billion people, there\u2019s inevitably someone doing whatever you\u2019re doing better thank you. As a leader, you should recognize and reward your employees for adopting and promoting better ideas from outside your company. Also, it\u2019s powerful to put your money where your mouth is and invest in your people\u2019s external learning, by funding their travel to visit other excellent companies and investing in their continuing education. One of the investments I\u2019ve been most happy with is our subscription to Safari Books Online, which gives our employees access to a vast library of excellent books as well as the ability to watch replays from all O\u2019Reilly conferences, where top industry experts share their most recent insights and practices. Working with senior executives Since none of this is free, it\u2019s also important that senior executives from around the company buy into what you\u2019re doing. We had the fortunate structural advantage that our most senior stakeholder \u2013 CIO Jeff Smith \u2013 had both a passion for driving positive culture change and a mandate from the top [9]. But mandates only go so far \u2013 you also need buy-in from other senior stakeholders. We learned that just as it\u2019s very effective to have champions at the grassroots level, it\u2019s also very helpful to have champions in the executive ranks. After a year or so, we formed very effective relationships with senior leaders like David Kenny and Beth Smith from Watson, Rob Thomas from Analytics, and Arvind Krishna from Research and Hybrid Cloud. These folks saw the value, and became key partners whose advocacy for the tools and methods gave air cover to the early adopters and early majority, and helped to pull along the later adopters. They also acted as a sort of board of directors, sharing their wisdom and perspective with us to guide the path forward and course correct when necessary. In summary As the saying goes, culture eats strategy for lunch. But \u201cchanging culture\u201d is not directly actionable. However, by picking and deploying great tools, and guiding a community to embrace and teach modern practices, you can start a positive chain reaction that results in meaningful and significant contributions to positive culture change. Footnotes [1] If you\u2019re not familiar with software delivery, here\u2019s an analogy. Netflix used to provide movies by physically mailing DVDs to your house, and then you\u2019d play them on your DVD player. This is like on premises software delivery \u2013 you download it, you install it, you run it. These days Netflix provides movies by making them available on-demand, streamable over the Internet. This is like as-a-service software delivery \u2013 you never download anything \u2013 you run it over the Internet. [2] To learn more about continuous delivery, Jez Humble has a web site that provides great insights, as well as links to several great books he has written on it. [3] For a description of the early days of the Service Engage project, you can read my article \u201cWorking like a startup at IBM\u201d on O\u2019Reilly Radar. [4] Credit for this aphorism to the great Grady Booch. [5] Good execution of deploying new tools at scale is actually very difficult. I have some scars to prove it! Please don\u2019t take the positive tone of this article to imply that we got everything right. We made plenty of mistakes along the way and these could form a whole other article! [6] I shared the origin story for one of the early tools \u2013 Slack \u2013 in my Medium post \u201cListen to the wild ducks: How IBM adopted Slack.\u201d [7] Jeff talked about \u201cfinding what best looks like\u201d and several other of his key leadership and transformation techniques in this 2016 CIO Leadership Exchange talk. If you liked this article, I highly recommend listening to Jeff\u2019s talk, since many of his ideas influenced our work. [8] This scorecard has three main set of criteria: capability, operational quality, financial sustainability. Capability includes things like \u201cimproves employee productivity and happiness\u201d, operational quality covers things like availability, performance, and security, and financial sustainability talks about TCO at scale and how to offset new investments with take-outs. [9] The project was originally co-sponsored by Jeff and IBM Design General Manager Phil Gilbert, who has a similar change mandate in the realm of design, as described in this excellent New York Times profile.
