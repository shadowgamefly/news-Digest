{"name": "440", "parent": "", "content": "The Top Tech Books of 2016 (Part\u00a0I) Here are the books Backchannel loved, plus an excerpt from\u00a0each. When I first began writing about technology, a modest shelf could actually hold pretty much all the volumes that we now recognized as \u201ctech books\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness-oriented tomes about tech companies, geeky explorations of hardware or software milestones, celebratory 0r scary projections of what our current products will morph to, and one more biography of Steve Jobs. Now they tumble out like doughnuts on a conveyor belt, as zillions of writers covering the field realize that to make a statement they have to go really longform. And it\u2019s great. No, you don\u2019t have to read them all. But be happy they are there. In every one of the hundreds of tech books published each year, there are almost certainly points of view, factoids, and observations worth bringing into the world. Though Kevin Kelly (cited below) loves the idea that everything we do will be measured in numbers, I believe that the ultimate measurement is the painstakingly considered rendering of a single human being, arrived at over months or years of thought, and presented at length in a coherent narrative. And every year a certain number of books of real distinction appear\u2014ones that will last. These are our targets in Backchannel\u2019s annual year-end reading fest. Here\u2019s how it works: our staffers recommend favorites\u200a\u2014\u200ajust in time for you to use the gift certificates you got for the holidays\u200a\u2014\u200aand tell you why the book is worth reading. And then we provide proof: a juicy excerpt from every one we recommend. It\u2019s just the thing to help divert you from the fact that 2017 may be even worse than this year. Please buy at least one of these (or one of the books we will talk about tomorrow, in Part II of our best-of list). As welcome as our touts might be, the ultimate validation of an author is the decision to buy his or her book.\u00a0\u2014 Steven Levy The Top Tech Books of 2016 (Part II)Here are five more books that Backchannel loved, plus an excerpt from each.backchannel.com Time Travel A history By James Gleick It takes Jim Gleick 250 pages to ask the question outright: What is time? The query comes after several chapters of virtuoso literary criticism, Windex-clear explanations of theories usually left to physicists, and vivid historical vignettes involving time capsules and tombs. The cast of characters has included H.G. Wells, Richard Nixon, Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein, William Gibson, Mr. Peabody. T.S. Eliot, Kurt G\u00f6del, Tom Stoppard, Stephen Hawking, Woody Allen, Robert Heinlein, and Lucifer. But especially H.G. Wells. We have learned about why it is impossible to go back in time to kill your grandfather and why, in some multiverse, it might have already happened. And now he asks us what time is? That\u2019s right, because by now we readers are ready for it. It\u2019s a massive question, and by his deft discussion of it, Gleick proves once again that he is our best creator of prose rabbit holes that ultimately lead us to understanding. I am not giving anything away when I say that while discouraging our hopes of visiting ancient Rome or checking out how the 10,000-year clock fares, Gleick proves that we are already time travelers, through our timepieces and our reading and our memories. The best books stop time for us. This one expands it.\u200a\u2014\u200aSteven Levy Read an excerpt from Time Travel here: How Time Travel BeganA fiction writer discovered the fourth dimension before Einstein did. Excerpted from Time Travel by James Gleick.backchannel.com Pinpoint How GPS is changing technology, culture, and our minds By Greg Milner It\u2019s a tall order to make something like the history of GPS remotely readable, but in Pinpoint, Greg Milner manages to create the suspense of a thriller novel, successfully conveying the message that GPS is one of the defining technologies of our time, built on a faint and relatively fragile signal. Initially developed as a military technology, GPS is now an integral and easily overlooked part of our daily lives\u200a\u2014\u200afrom helping us navigate from point A to point B on our smartphones to assisting with air traffic control\u200a\u2014\u200aand, as Milner expertly shows, its existence is fundamentally changing the ways we live and think. Nowhere is that more clear than when Milner offers up a series of harrowing tales of people who\u2019ve literally driven themselves to or near death by over-reliance on GPS, trusting that, as a navigational system directed them to proceed along ever-narrower roads or through lakes, it must be right. And not surprisingly so: as Pinpoint details, our ability to form what psychologists call \u201ccognitive maps\u201d is more or less wasting away, as our dependence on GPS to create those maps for us increases. \u2014Miranda Katz Read an excerpt from Pinpoint here: How GPS Became a Human Tracking MechanismExcerpted from Pinpoint by Greg Milner.backchannel.com Sprint How to solve big problems and test new ideas in just five days By Jake Knapp with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz If there exists a formula for coming up with the out-of-the-box ideas that find their way into the products and services that grow up to become Silicon Valley startups, surely Sprint encapsulates it. Principal author Jake Knapp, a genial and remarkably tall designer, developed his method at Google, where he led design \u201csprints\u201d for Chrome, Gmail, and Google Search, among others. Now he\u2019s a partner at Google Ventures, where he\u2019s joined designers\u200a\u2014\u200aand coauthors\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz. They\u2019ve conducted sprints for more than 100 portfolio companies. Their book is a DYI guide to problem solving. It\u2019s refreshingly devoid of platitudes and leadership catchphrases. Instead, the trio offers a step-by-step guide to every last element of the five-day process, from identifying a problem on day one to testing a prototype with customers on day five. They leave no question unanswered, from the correct number of participants (best is seven) to the types of supplies you need to bring or leave behind (no devices allowed). They use real-life examples from popular startups such as Blue Bottle Coffee and Flatiron Health to illustrate their points. It\u2019s a quick read, intended as a reference to which you can return when you run into one of those inevitable roadblocks that seems insolvable. But as always, it\u2019s not the formula that helps the well-intentioned solve problems and dream up new ideas. It\u2019s what we do with it.\u200a\u2014\u200aJessi Hempel Read an excerpt from Sprint here: Inside Blue Bottle Coffee\u2019s Sprint to Get Off the GroundExcerpted from Sprint by Jake Knapp with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz, of Google Ventures.backchannel.com Death\u2019s End By Cixin Liu, translated by Ken Liu Should Cixin Liu be considered a Chinese writer, emblematic of his cultural moment, or simply a writer who happens to be Chinese? Suffice it to say: Liu is magnificent, and Death\u2019s End, released in translation this fall, brings to an appropriately spectacular crescendo his much-celebrated Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy, which began with The Three-Body Problem\u2019s invasion of aliens who shake civilization with several subatomic particles and continued with The Dark Forest\u2019s extinction-level game theory writ cosmic. (If you haven\u2019t read those two already, do that first. Really.) The Three-Body Problem won a Hugo Award, science fiction\u2019s highest honor, and Liu\u200a\u2014\u200awhom The New Yorker called \u201cChina\u2019s Arthur C. Clarke\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahas been credited for putting the science back into a genre recently and lamentably preoccupied, at least to some critics, by sociological rather than material operatics. The science of Death\u2019s End, which begins with humanity\u2019s ongoing intergalactic struggle and ends on a far vaster stage, is indeed\u200a\u2014\u200ato use Liu\u2019s phrase\u200a\u2014\u200aultra-grand: quantum physics and planetary engineering, deep-time cryogenics and a quest to slow light speed itself. (The science is not all bloodless, either; among the trilogy\u2019s most poignant moments are appreciations of nature and disgust at its despoilage.) Liu has an obvious love for science\u2014its process as well as its insights, and also its beauties: four-dimensional space, he writes in one memorable passage, \u201cimpressed itself upon the soul, and gave the observers the experience of seeing the mountain contained in a mustard seed described in Buddhist parables.\u201d Indeed. Focusing exclusively on Liu\u2019s maximalist science, though, disservices his narrative craftsmanship\u200a\u2014\u200aDeath\u2019s End could have easily been several novels, each thrilling\u200a\u2014\u200aand his human side. Liu\u2019s confidence in material engineering is equaled by his faith, reassuring in our own troubled moment, in democracy and enlightened global governance. Riding these currents are modern everymen, ennobled by love and duty and doubt\u200a\u2014\u200aand when Death\u2019s End concludes with, to reference another Chinese invention, the escalating beauty of a fireworks show, it\u2019s the pathos rather than the science that brings tears to one\u2019s eyes.\u200a\u2014\u200aBrandon Keim Read an excerpt from Death\u2019s End here: The Death of the MagicianExcerpted from Death\u2019s End by Cixin Liu, translated by Ken Liubackchannel.com Weapons of Math Destruction How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy By Cathy O\u2019Neil If you thought the world was unfair before, crack open Weapons of Math Destruction and prepare for your blood to simmer. In this tour of biased algorithms, data scientist Cathy O\u2019Neil explains how the software that runs our banks, police departments, schools, and online ads, among other things, seizes on existing social inequality and amplifies it. Algorithms determining the rankings of such disparate things as employee performance, an inmate\u2019s risk of recidivism, and the quality of colleges are often flawed because they don\u2019t have access to the ground truth. They rely instead on proxies: substitute data from which they build statistical castles. As O\u2019Neil writes, the builders of these flawed models draw \u201ccorrelations between a person\u2019s zip code or language patterns and her potential to pay back a loan or handle a job. These correlations are discriminatory, and some of them are illegal.\u201d And they serve to widen the divide between the haves and have-nots. O\u2019Neil contends we should take an active role in policing and taming these flawed algorithms. She leaves it vague how exactly we might do so, but as with many emerging challenges, the first step is to bring these secretive algorithms into the harsh light of day.\u200a\u2014\u200aSandra Upson Read an excerpt from Weapons of Math Destruction here: Be Healthy or Else: How Corporations Became Obsessed with Fitness TrackingExcerpted from Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O\u2019Neil.backchannel.com The Inevitable Understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future By Kevin Kelly In The Inevitable, Kevin Kelly uses one particular construction quite a lot: Twenty (or some similar number) years ago nobody would have believed that\u2026 And then he fills in the blank with something that\u2019s part of our everyday lives, like asking a question to a robot in the cloud and getting a very specific answer, or invoking an address halfway around the globe and getting an image of what\u2019s standing in that very spot on earth. Once you understand his point about how quickly things can shift from the realm of unbelievable to everyday stuff, then you can more easily swallow the marvels he describes in The Inevitable. You may even agree with him that they are, indeed, inevitable. Ever the techno-optimist, Kelly embraces a future where robots do a lot of the work, people augment reality with an illuminating digital layer, ubiquitous software tracking churns out metrics on everything we do, and earthlings collaborate routinely to maximize our resources and intelligence. While acknowledging that tech has a downside, he concentrates on how the future will improve our collective log. This makes for provocative reading in 2016. But if Kelly is right, 20 years from now, people will come across The Inevitable and wonder why anyone thought it would be otherwise.\u200a\u2014\u200aSteven Levy Read an excerpt from The Inevitable here: The Seven Steps Toward Making Humans ObsoleteOr, how we stopped fighting and learned to love our robot replacements.
