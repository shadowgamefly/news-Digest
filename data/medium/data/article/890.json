{"name": "890", "parent": "", "content": "Let\u2019s Talk About Bald-Shaming The latest salvo in the ongoing saga of male body-shaming is a new piece from Men\u2019s Health explaining why your man bun could be making you bald. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the cool guys emulating samurai, you could be causing your hairline to recede,\u201d they write, before explaining how tight buns stress the hair follicles and could lead to alopecia, aka hair loss, aka Get out of here, baldy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly beauty advice for dudes, but what happened to \u201cbald is beautiful\u201d? Isn\u2019t it strange to instruct men to embrace their chrome dome\u200a\u2014\u200anoting not only that bald men are more confident and attractive but that they also get the babes\u200a\u2014\u200awhile simultaneously instructing them to avoid it at all costs? Not if you\u2019re a woman. This is precisely the sort of jerk-around beauty advice ladies have been getting for years: You\u2019re great how exactly how you are\u200a\u2014\u200anow change. Only our advice goes something like this: Fat is beautiful, but here\u2019s how to drop the weight in a few short weeks. Embrace aging, but here are 18 serums to stop it in its tracks. Your vagina is fine! Now hose it down. Women are used to being told they\u2019re doing everything wrong, from pubes to faces to pregnancy, while men are usually left alone to have a dadbod and still be considered fuckable. Part of this is about capitalism: It\u2019s harder to sell to people who like themselves, and at the end of the day, men\u2019s money is just as green as women\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s why the market for men\u2019s grooming products is now booming. But with that shift comes a strange new world: Men are starting to get it both ways, too, and it\u2019s a recurring complaint from men in the body positivity movement. Before they can start a good dialog about how it feels to be body shamed, they first have the fight the stereotype that aren\u2019t supposed to care about how they look in the first place. Of course, women understand\u200a\u2014\u200agiven our access to makeup and contouring and product and flattering outfits\u200a\u2014\u200athat pretty is really a set of skills. Pampering and perfuming to put the goods in the best possible light is part and parcel of performing femininity. But we haven\u2019t historically asked this kind of aesthetic energy of men, and giving men a pass on baldness would seem to signal our understanding that they have had fewer tricks up their sleeve to alter their appearances. Spencer Kobren, Founder of the American Hair Loss Association, gets at this in some of his discussions of baldness. He calls bald shaming the \u201clast bastion of political incorrectness\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aan area of male body-shaming for which we offer men no protection. In a video in his series \u201cThe Bald Truth,\u201d he tells an anecdote about a woman approaching him at dinner in Los Angeles one night who compliments his hair and is surprised when he tells her that he actually paints the back of his head to hide the balding. She tells him it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to care so much about something so trivial. He notes the irony that the comment is coming from a 45-year-old woman who has clearly spackled so much makeup on her face that her real face is virtually undetectable. \u201cThis is all I got,\u201d he said, referring to his appearance. \u201cThis is basically what I look like. I don\u2019t wear a face full of makeup, a push-up bra, a spray-on tan, fake nails, high heels. I had a shirt on, my head was painted, and I was ready to go. This woman was basically wearing a costume to leave the house\u2026. The fact that she would even consider trivializing what we go through when it probably takes her three hours to get out of the fucking house in the morning is laughable to me, and I think it illustrates the insanity that is the way society views men dealing with issues with their appearance. They want every man to look like George Clooney, but if he tries to maintain his appearance, there\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d He\u2019s obviously pissed\u200a\u2014\u200aand he fails to realize that in spite of his looks being harder to alter, as a man, he doesn\u2019t have to be good looking if he\u2019s funny or, say, really rich\u200a\u2014\u200abut that doesn\u2019t mean his sentiment is wrong. Bald men are the butt of jokes. Being bald is bad, but not as bad as being vain about it. French dating app Zoosk ran a campaign a few years ago promoting that they verify the photos of their users, with the example being a profile photo of a dater compared with his \u201creal\u201d photo, in which he\u2019s bald. The picture was removed after some protest online from bald men, but a hair loss forum captured it for discussion before that happened. \u201cDid anyone give a fuck?\u201d a user asked about the image. \u201cDid the social justice warriors come out swinging? No, because it\u2019s men and we don\u2019t exist but also because apparently baldness is supposed to be funny. Why?\u201d Well, it can be funny. In an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David calls the cops to report a hate crime: Some kids who spray painted \u201cBald Asshole\u201d on his front door when he wouldn\u2019t give them candy on Halloween. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d he says. \u201cBald asshole? That\u2019s a hate crime. We\u2019re a sect. We\u2019re a group. You can\u2019t call us bald assholes. What if we were gay? Then it\u2019d be gay asshole. That\u2019s a hate crime!\u201d The cops laugh it off. \u201cSir, I\u2019m bald and I\u2019m not offended,\u201d one cop says, pointing to the graffiti. \u201cWith all due respect, Officer, you\u2019re not bald,\u201d Larry David objects. \u201cYou have chosen to shave your hair; that\u2019s a look you\u2019re cultivating to be fashionable and we don\u2019t really consider you a part of the bald community, with all due respect.\u201d This may be a critical distinction: Baldness is an affliction, one not chosen, so it\u2019s punching down to knock a dude who can\u2019t do much about losing his hair. Not helping matters is that women sometimes take a strange comfort in this insecurity. In 2015, Jessica Machado wrote a piece at New York magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Cut\u201d in which she admitted to a little bald schadenfreude. The piece was called \u201cI Love Watching Men Worry About Balding.\u201d In it, she discusses watching the aging men in her life begin to slowly and quietly melt down about their hair. Men who rarely admit to being affected by body-shame fears (aside from the odd beer gut or short-guy joke) are suddenly candid about losing their hair. Machado writes: \u201cWhat I do is, I shave my widow\u2019s peak back a bit, so it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m receding that bad,\u201d one friend said to another. Another buddy relayed a story of being humiliated by a homeless man who called out, \u201cHey, baldy, how \u2019bout some change?\u201d A third will beat everyone to a punch that no one was about to throw: \u201cHow threatening am I? I\u2019m the bald dude at the bar!\u201d She\u2019s not into \u201cegging on a balding man\u2019s fears\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just that there\u2019s a fascination in seeing such a forthright display of male insecurity. It\u2019s humanizing. Men! They really are just like us! \u201c\u2026Just when you get your shit together, your life\u2019s in better financial order, you\u2019re building a family, you\u2019re more comfortable with yourself, not really thinking about appearance stuff anymore, then you start to lose your hair,\u201d Machado\u2019s husband tells her. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling.\u201d The internal panic, she notes\u200a\u2014\u200aacross celebrities who seem to rush to get hair implants before a hint of balding sets in (McConaughey, Affleck, Chris Martin)\u200a\u2014\u200adoesn\u2019t translate to problems in the real world. Studies show bald men appear stronger and more dominant. Chris Martin Maybe all this fluffing about balding is just a way of masking how vain men can really be about their looks. Maybe balding is only great if you happen to look like Vin Diesel. Maybe at best, and in spite of the studies, balding is still something men resign themselves to putting up with but would never actually choose. A different Curb Your Enthusiasm episode has two men simultaneously delighting and commiserating in their shared baldness. \u201cLotta sunscreen, right?\u201d Larry David notes. \u201cNo convertibles!\u201d When the hair goes, it seems, you make the best out of balding; you don\u2019t celebrate it. Sucks, dudes. But welcome to our world. For every man\u2019s fear of balding, women are spinning multiple plates of aging angst. To name a few: weight gain, saggy tits, crow\u2019s feet, arm flab, stretch marks, armpit fat, wrinkly knees\u200a\u2014\u200aand every other microscopic part of our bodies that has been spliced and diced for improvement for decades by an industry with an eagle eye, hell-bent on squeezing every last dime out of our insecurities. None of this is to suggest that men deserve bald-shaming, or that, like women, they should now be finger-wagged into misery over things they can do little about (and shouldn\u2019t have to). But if if true equality is equal exploitation of the sexes, then instead of giving all of us a break on this relentless pressure to look better, it seems we\u2019re just getting ever closer to making everybody feel equally like shit about themselves.
