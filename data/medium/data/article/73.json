{"name": "73", "parent": "", "content": "LeBron James Killed the Dinosaurs And we\u2019re not just talking about Phil\u00a0Jackson Welcome to King of the Court, our daily celebration of the best players in basketball from the night that was. We\u2019ll be keeping track of the best player of every night of the NBA season, and tallying the results as we go along. King of the Court: LeBron\u00a0James On Tuesday, LeBron James fended off the past and the present. Prior to the night\u2019s stress test with the Raptors (Cleveland\u2019s toughest Eastern Conference competition this season), the Cavs star addressed an interview Phil Jackson gave to ESPN\u2019s Jackie MacMullan, in which the Knicks president gossiped a bit about James\u2019s departure from Miami and issues Pat Riley may have had with him: \u201cWhen LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland, and he wanted to spend the night. They don\u2019t do overnights.\u00a0\u2026 You can\u2019t hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland.\u201d James specifically objected to the use of the word posse: \u201cIf you go and read the definition of what the word posse is, it\u2019s not what I\u2019ve built over my career.\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s not what I stand for, it\u2019s not what my family stands for. I believe the only reason he used that word is because he sees young African Americans trying to make a difference.\u201d The posse comment wasn\u2019t the only stupid, candid, or strange thing Jackson said to MacMullan. He opined on how Mike Conley Jr. was New York\u2019s main offseason free-agent target (why mention it now?), how Conley\u2019s contract is \u201calmost insane\u201d (it\u2019s not your money?), his feelings about running the triangle (\u201c[W]hen they run it I want them to run it the right way\u201d), his ambivalence about running the triangle (\u201cI don\u2019t care about the triangle\u201d) (STOP TALKING ABOUT THE TRIANGLE), Carmelo Anthony\u2019s need for attention (\u201cI was never the guy who said, \u2018Let\u2019s go out to dinner.\u2019 But with Melo, I do that\u201d), and how he satisfies Melo\u2019s needs with stories about Snoop Dogg. But the \u201cposse\u201d jibe stuck because it was tone-deaf, condescending, and\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it was part of some mind game\u200a\u2014\u200anasty. The paternalistic reading lists and Zen Buddhism don\u2019t play the way they used to. Maybe it was always bullshit and we just got better detectors. There is a certain mysticism we ascribe to Jackson\u2019s teachings, and that can sometimes obscure the lengths he will go to in order to publicly manipulate people or denigrate their achievements. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be that guy that ever downplays somebody or tries to knock someone off just [to] feel better about myself,\u201d said James. This is true. He will just take on the next poor opponents and throw them down a well. You don\u2019t want to see LeBron James motivated. LeBron\u2019s line in Cleveland\u2019s 121\u2013117 victory was 28 points, 14 assists, and nine boards, which is right around the 23.4 points, 9.6 assists, and 8.9 boards per game averages that he has put up in this ruthlessly efficient season. On Tuesday, he played and guarded every position. He did stuff like this in the post: And stuff like this, while running the offense: Because of the various dramas surrounding his career\u200a\u2014\u200athose written by him or by others\u200a\u2014\u200aJames\u2019s heroism and \u201cvillainy\u201d (remember when LeBron James was considered a villain in this country?) has sometimes overshadowed his unprecedented consistency. He is nearly averaging a triple-double this season. We paint murals for Russell Westbrook over similar achievements. LeBron? We take him for granted. The Cavaliers are defending champions\u200a\u2014\u200aa fact I don\u2019t think we talk about enough\u200a\u2014\u200aand have tied their franchise-best start, at 9\u20131. He is doing what he does best: lifting other people up. Cleveland had championship swagger against Toronto on Tuesday night. The Raptors came into the game with a 7\u20132 record, the NBA scoring leader (DeMar DeRozan), the third-best offense in the league, and some scattered chatter that they were ready to make the leap and challenge Cleveland for Eastern Conference supremacy. And none of that changes. Their offense was diverse, DeRozan scored 26, they competed to the very end of the game, and Cleveland still runs this shit. The Cavs look better right now than they did in June. Ty Lue is wearing his Brad Stevens out-of-timeout-wizard hat well (ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin referred to Lue as \u201cA-Ty-O\u201d), Richard Jefferson doesn\u2019t look a day older than 30, Kyrie Irving is playing with \u201cI won the NBA Finals\u201d swagger, and Kevin Love looks like an All-Star. They are playing like their leader: consistent and ruthless. \u201cI get a thrill out of bringing a group together and helping them reach a place they didn\u2019t know they could go,\u201d James told Lee Jenkins when he returned to Cleveland. We can see that almost every night. It\u2019s a shame Phil Jackson can\u2019t. Runner-up: Frank\u00a0Kaminsky Are we sure Frank Kaminsky wasn\u2019t playing H-O-R-S-E with a ghost on Tuesday? In Charlotte\u2019s 115\u2013108 victory over Minnesota, the second-year big man was letting off Steve Nash runners and pulling up from Steph Curry\u2019s zip code. The Tank scored 20 points, 12 of which came in the fourth quarter. I am going to need a period of decompression after seeing this.
