{"name": "1347", "parent": "", "content": "Why your startup idea isn\u2019t big enough for some\u00a0VCs The one, simple equation that every VC\u00a0knows. Venture Capital functions with a power law where the majority of a fund\u2019s returns come from a small percentage of investments. Because of this, VCs need to know if a single investment can return the entire fund. As Bill Gurley famously said \u201cVenture capital is not even a home run business. It\u2019s a grand slam business.\u201d This is where the Return The Fund (RTF) analysis comes into play. http://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html If we assume an exit distribution where over 60% of a fund\u2019s investments are 0\u20132x their money, with the remainder falling somewhere between 2\u20135x, a \u201cunicorn\u201d type 10x+ outcome can put a venture fund into the desired 3x fund returns that puts them among the top performers in VC. Your 1\u20133 investments that \u201creturn the fund\u201d and probably even more (the grand slam), is what will make or break you, while the other 2x-5x investments create additional alpha. The math for a RTF analysis is pretty simple: Fund Size / % owned at exit = Minimum Viable Exit To show how this works, let\u2019s take the hottest new deep learning, autonomous vehicle startup built on the blockchain, XY.ai, as an example. XY.ai is raising a $2M seed round at a $10M post-money valuation (selling 20% of their company). VC Fund A is a $50M seed fund investing $1M So in order to pass the RTF analysis, VC Fund A must believe that XY.ai will exit for at least $500M and more realistically $625M. Now let\u2019s look at a larger fund model. VC Fund B is a $250M seed + series A fund investing $1M in\u00a0XY.ai. For more data of equity ownership at exits check out EquityZen\u2019s Path to IPO. As an investor, the difference between a company exiting for $500M vs. $2.5B is not trivial. Less than 10% of all VC-backed exits in 2016 were $500M+, per CB Insights. Jet.com was the only US-based VC-backed tech company to exit for over $2.5B. As a founder, this trickles down to thinking about their potential investor\u2019s philosophy. While some businesses are best built to exit in the hundreds of millions of dollars, larger funds could push startups through their natural inflection/exit points in order to go for broke and hit a grand slam that is very unlikely to occur. While the RTF analysis is a good barometer for investments, it is indeed just one data point in the larger diligence process. It is a quick way to gut check ownership and investment size, and also allows investors to think about how they will need to build their positions over time. But while this thought process is generally useful, like all things in startups, there are outliers.
