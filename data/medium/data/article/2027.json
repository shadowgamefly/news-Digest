Pitbull? The soundtracks from the \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 franchise are a time capsule of hip-hop music in the\u00a0aughts. For more than a decade and a half, the Fast & Furious franchise has ripped, roared, and pressed every last NOS button on its way to action-franchise preeminence. To mark the release of Fate of the Furious, the series\u2019 eighth installment, we\u2019re declaring it Fast 8 Week. Please join us in living life one quarter-mile at a time. The cover art for the soundtrack for the first Fast & Furious movie is a faded portrait shot of a smirking Ja Rule wearing a durag. It\u2019s a fitting image, despite the fact that he has only a minute of screen time in the original film. The movie premiered in 2001, at the height of Ja\u2019s ubiquity, and so naturally the rapper appears on five (of 17) songs on the OST. The two record labels that largely produced the soundtrack, Def Jam and Murder Inc., didn\u2019t skimp on additional talent. Ashanti\u2019s here, plus every other rapper not named Nas or Jay who had some buzz at the time. Here\u2019s the album cover billing: Ja Rule, Faith Evans, Scarface, DMX, Funkmaster Flex feat. Noreaga, R. Kelly, Tank, Limp Bizkit, Redman, Method Man, Caddillac Tah, Vita, Black Child, Petey Pablo, Ashanti, Fat Joe, and more\u00a0\u2026 Ja Rule was the star of the soundtrack, but Caddillac Tah made its best song: \u201cPOV City Anthem,\u201d a hardbody ringtone rap anthem. In the spirit of the year that the song was released\u200a\u2014\u200a2001\u200a\u2014\u200athe producer Mr. Fingaz sampled a two-way pager for its beat. Is the first Fast & Furious soundtrack a great rap album? No. In fact, much of its music has aged poorly and/or was horrible to begin with. Nonetheless, this and all of the other albums from the 16-year-old film franchise are great soundtracks, because they perfectly preserve the sensibilities of urban radio throughout the aughts. Given its surprisingly long life span, the Fast & Furious franchise has yielded soundtracks that have kept definitive track of hip-hop\u2019s pulse. Thus, when Ja Rule fell off, he fell off the Fast soundtracks, too. The 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack essentially replaced Ja with 2 Fast costar Ludacris, fresh off his commercial peak as a rapper. Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious both rode Pharrell and Pitbull during the Neptunes\u2019 post\u2013\u201cRock Your Body\u201d club rat wave. Fast Five put Don Omar on a \u201cHow We Roll\u201d remix with Busta Rhymes, creating a strange mash-up of reggaeton and the post\u2013Lex Luger trap maximalism that was popping among Southern rappers. Fast 6 signaled EDM\u2019s ubiquity by putting late-career Ludacris and late-career Usher together on \u201cRest of My Life,\u201d produced by David Guetta. Fast 7 yielded the franchise\u2019s biggest single, \u201cSee You Again,\u201d a tribute to the late Paul Walker. The Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth collaboration is the franchise\u2019s most successful record, and it happens to encapsulate one of the decade\u2019s more insipid pop-crossover formulas, mixing piano sappiness with arena-sized kumbaya wailing and super-sincere Top 40 rapping. For posterity\u2019s sake, as always, The Fate of the Furious soundtrack is an effective summary of urban music in 2017. Migos is on here rapping non sequiturs about bath salts, NASCAR, and David Hasselhoff on \u201cSeize the Block,\u201d with Quavo breaking off to belt a soaring chorus on \u201cGo Off\u201d with Lil Uzi Vert and Travis Scott. Returning champ Wiz Khalifa is on a minor-key trap holler called \u201cGang Up\u201d with 2 Chainz, Young Thug, and PnB Rock\u200a\u2014\u200aa cross-gen roster that summarizes hip-hop\u2019s current \u201crapsung\u201d identity crisis. There\u2019s an even larger crisis afoot in the form of token white rapper G-Eazy, who further ruins an already bad song called \u201cGood Life\u201d with Kehlani. Like it or not, no definitive record of hip-hop in 2017 is complete without accounting for G-Eazy\u2019s unfortunate run of Zara cardigan raps. And then there\u2019s Pitbull. Unlike previous Fast soundtrack MVPs, Pitbull has somehow never appeared in a Fast movie, but he\u2019s been blessing these soundtracks with bilingual bops since 2 Fast 2 Furious. That was 2003, when he still wore massively oversized white tees and made crunk music. These days, Pitbull dresses like a Cuban American 007 and makes Carnival Cruise music. The best song on the Fate soundtrack is Pitbull and the Colombian singer J Balvin\u2019s collaboration \u201cHey Ma,\u201d which strikes at American pop music\u2019s current obsession with tropical grooves. \u201cHey Ma\u201d is the slight-but-sensational work of a rapper whose appeal is as broad and enduring as the Fast franchise itself. Both have come a long and lucrative way since their humble early-2000s beginnings. The Fate of the Furious soundtrack is a veritable Shoney\u2019s breakfast buffet of contemporary hip-hop, the common ground where G-Eazy meets Kevin Gates. Big-budget soundtracks like Fifty Shades of Grey can churn out a decent pop single or two, but rarely do they capture the zeitgeist so comprehensively. When Suicide Squad was in theaters, there was a lot of consternation about the movie\u2019s cloying mix of pop and oldies, which were so hyperactive and unsubtle as to be totally overbearing. There is nothing cool or exhilarating about hearing \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d for the 1,000,000th time in the 1,000th movie that has licensed that song. You know what is cool? Kodak Black rapping about horsepower for a $110 million car movie in A.D. 2017. I don\u2019t know if Kodak Black will be around next year, but he\u2019s here now, and a Fate of the Furious soundtrack placement is the best sort of participation trophy that a young rapper could hope for. These movies are, after all, hypermasculine flicks about street racing, starring cars built for speed, handling, and bass. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no better setting to hear \u201cPOV City Anthem\u201d than in a Porsche GTS.
