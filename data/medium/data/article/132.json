Led by the 19-year-old rookie, a young Toronto team is back in the playoffs and rejuvenating one of the league\u2019s oldest franchises. It has been a year of milestones for Auston Matthews. In February, the sneaker enthusiast secured a pair of Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2 Zebras, celebrating the moment by sharing his grails on social media. Life couldn\u2019t get any better. Later that day, the Toronto Maple Leafs rookie went out and dazzled the Air Canada Centre with a two-goal performance against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the first Leafs rookie to reach 30 goals since 1989. Not bad for a Saturday. It\u2019s hard to tell which accomplishment was more difficult.

On Thursday, when Toronto takes the ice for its first-round opener against the Eastern Conference top-seed Washington Capitals, it will do so with a collection of young forwards who have combined for the third most points in NHL history by a team\u2019s rookie crop.

The Leafs\u2019 deterioration began four years ago, at the conclusion of their most recent playoff appearance. Against the Boston Bruins in the 2013 opening round, Toronto fought back from a 3\u20131 series deficit only to crumble in Game 7\u200a\u2014\u200alosing a 4\u20131 third-period lead in the cruelest way possible. The Leafs and their fans were traumatized, and the malaise spread into the next season, when Toronto posted a winning record but failed to make the playoffs. It was a return to mediocrity for the franchise, which prior to 2013 had gone seven straight seasons without qualifying for the postseason. The nosedive accelerated in 2014\u201315; Toronto fired coach Randy Carlyle in January and won only six times in regulation over its final 51 games, ending up with the fourth-worst record in the NHL. With futility came fan frustration. At a home game two weeks after Carlyle was fired, several fans threw their Leafs jerseys onto the ice. To make matters worse, the Leafs weren\u2019t even good at failing\u200a\u2014\u200ain finishing fourth in the lottery, Toronto missed out on drafting Connor McDavid or Jack Eichel. The angst seeped into the media, where the tenuous relationship between the city and top scorer Phil Kessel boiled over. After the 2015 season, the Leafs traded Kessel, in many ways the avatar of both Toronto\u2019s 2013 playoff collapse and the team\u2019s subsequent decline, to the Pittsburgh Penguins. On his way out, his time in Toronto was capped with a Toronto Sun column alleging Kessel made daily stops to a hot dog stand and that the organization \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand having him around anymore.\u201d Behind the scenes of the turmoil, however, there were beginning to be signs of light. Team president Brendan Shanahan, who was hired before the 2014\u201315 season, was working on a plan. In Shanahan\u2019s first draft, the Leafs used the eighth pick of the first round to select Nylander. The following May, Shanahan hired highly esteemed former Detroit head coach Mike Babcock, the winner of a Stanley Cup (Red Wings, 2008) and two Olympic golds (Canada, 2010 and 2014). In the 2015 draft\u200a\u2014\u200athe McDavid-Eichel one\u200a\u2014\u200athe Leafs picked fourth and grabbed Marner. One month later, Shanahan hired three-time Cup winner Lou Lamoriello to be the Leafs\u2019 new general manager. At the 2016 trade deadline, Shanahan and Lamoriello jettisoned the contract of defenseman and team captain Dion Phaneuf via trade to Ottawa, clearing long-term cap space. In Babcock\u2019s first season, the Leafs sunk to the very bottom of the NHL. Recordwise, it was the worst season in their century-long history\u200a\u2014\u200abut somehow it felt better than the year before. With the Shanny-Lou-Babcock triumvirate in place, there was newfound hope. This time Toronto had failed the right way. In the 2016 draft lottery, the Leafs won the first overall pick and the right to select Auston Matthews. The savior of Toronto hockey spent his formative years in the desert. Matthews, whose mother is from Mexico, grew up in Scottsdale and played his first hockey at Ozzie Ice in Phoenix, a complex with two undersized rinks that could accommodate only three-on-three games. As a child, he had to adjust to playing with the puck in tight spaces. \u201cHe learned how to stickhandle in a phone booth, then all of a sudden he was put out in a full sheet of ice,\u201d said his father, Brian Matthews. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got that much more time to react and execute.\u201d At age 17, Matthews broke the United States National Team Development Program single-season goals record, previously shared by Kessel and Patrick Kane. The following year, with every major college and Canadian junior program begging him to join, he shocked everyone and turned pro, electing to play overseas in Switzerland. His goal was to be as prepared for the NHL as possible before entering the draft. The 2016 first-overall pick left little doubt about his readiness when, in his first career NHL game, he scored four times against the Ottawa Senators. The goals continued to come for Matthews, who broke the single-season franchise record for rookies set by Wendel Clark. The Leafs\u2019 other rookie stars have also made this season memorable. Nylander\u200a\u2014\u200athe son of retired NHL player Michael\u200a\u2014\u200ashows the guile of a grizzled veteran on Matthews\u2019s right wing, spacing the ice and wielding a wicked shot that whistles off his stick. Marner, a center turned right-winger, creates space in crowded areas that makes it seem like defenders are trying to avoid him. Along with scoring from James van Riemsdyk and Nazem Kadri, the rookie Big Three will need to produce to compensate for Toronto\u2019s less-than-stellar defense if the Leafs are to stand a chance against Washington. But as heavy underdogs, Toronto is playing with house money. The direction of the franchise is no longer a question; today the only debate is about whether or not Maple Leafs players will be permitted to grow playoff beards given Lamoriello\u2019s past no-facial-hair policy. In Shanahan\u2019s estimation, it\u2019s a question of anatomy, not autonomy. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to,\u201d said the Leafs president. \u201cThe question is, can they?\u201d ", "title": "The Snapchat Generation Saved the Toronto Maple\u00a0Leafs", "sentences": [{"ddae": "The Snapchat Generation Saved the Toronto Maple\u00a0Leafs"}, {"043c": "Last season, the Leafs finished dead last in the NHL standings.
