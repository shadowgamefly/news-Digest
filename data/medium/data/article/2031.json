In honor of Valentine\u2019s Day (thank god that greedy excuse to sell pink and red garbage of a holiday\u2019s over) I thought I\u2019d write a little something about relationships. Bad ones. And the inevitable warning signs we sometimes miss along the way. But first, before all the greeting card company reps and the Russell Stover\u2019s fan club members leave a bunch of angry comments claiming I\u2019m a bitter little asshole who hates \u201clove\u201d because I ate too many Hersey\u2019s Kisses as a kid and puked up wax-flavored chocolates all over my first grade crush, let me clarify: I absolutely do NOT hate \u201clove\u201d or high-quality dark chocolates. I actually love love! I just don\u2019t like being told by jewelry stores and Hallmark when or how I should tell my honey pie what he means to me. And let\u2019s be honest\u200a\u2014\u200aone\u2019s first introduction to Valentine\u2019s Day generally involves a dozen tiny Batman cards that say, \u201cYou\u2019re the Greatest Valen-Bat!\u201d and include heart candies that taste like engraved foot powder (I imagine). As far as holidays go, it\u2019s no Halloween. 25 Beet-Red Warning Flags & Relationship Deal-Breakers: Note: I run an equal opportunity blog, so please adjust any gender references as necessary. 1. He has \u201caccidentally\u201d called you mom on more than one occasion. 2. He smells like warm cheese dipped in Polo. BEFORE he goes to the gym. 3. When you call him, sometimes, for no apparent reason, his phone just doesn\u2019t ring. And he \u201cnever got your voicemail\u201d\u2026 or your text messages. It\u2019s a goddamn unsolved mystery. We can send a man to the bloody moon, but we can\u2019t get this poor bastard\u2019s cell phone out of the Bermuda-fucking-Triangle. And it\u2019s not because he has T-Mobile. 4. You mention you\u2019re into yoga (dodge-ball, stamp-collecting, whatever) so he tells you about his last girlfriend who was also into yoga and how she was absolutely amazing OR a Fatal Attraction psycho. Either way, you\u2019re a disappointment. 5. You\u2019re sure there\u2019s a deep, emotionally-available guy under all the insensitivity and hair gel\u200a\u2014\u200aand if you\u2019re patient and understanding enough, you\u2019ll eventually get there. Hahahahahahahahaha! Stop it, my stomach hurts. 6. He says he\u2019s totally \u201cover\u201d his ex. Which is why he won\u2019t stop talking about her, meeting her for coffee, or having \u201cjust friends\u201d sex with her. 7. He has the sense of humor of an intellectually-stunted corpse\u2026 wrapped in plastic and weighed down with cinder blocks, at the bottom of a river. 8. When asked to list his positive traits, the best you can come up with is, \u201cHe almost never has food in his teeth.\u201d Almost. 9. He made you watch the entire first season of Entourage. 10. She made you watch the entire first season of ANYTHING on Bravo. 11. His idea of emotional intimacy is letting you stay over\u2026 until 3am, when it\u2019s all, \u201cEvvverybody out! You don\u2019t havta go home, but ya can\u2019t stay here.\u201d 12. He has all the introspection of a heavily-sedated bowl of pudding. 13. If you were injured and required immediate medical attention during Sports Center, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d let you bleed to death. Because it was pretty selfish of you to get hit by a car during Gatorade Cooler Talk. 14. When you get sick, he suddenly remembers his grandmother just died and he has to leave town for the funeral. 15. When you need a date to a friend\u2019s wedding, he suddenly remembers his grandmother just died and he has to leave town for the funeral. 16. When you want to make out, he suddenly remembers his grandmother didn\u2019t die\u200a\u2014\u200ait was his friend\u2019s co-worker\u2019s second-cousin\u2019s third-grade music teacher. He\u2019s not going to the funeral. 17. He thinks he looks like Ryan Gosling. He actually looks like Mr. Magoo. 18. She thinks she looks like Scarlett Johansson. She also looks like Mr. Magoo.* *If you\u2019re one of the\u00a0.0024% of people who find Mr. Magoo attractive, my apologies and\u2026 gross. 19. One of you thinks he\u2019s infallible. 20. You spend the entire day together and he barely acknowledges your presence. You\u2019re Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Shit. 21. His pet names for you leave much to be desired: \u201cHey you,\u201d <finger snapping sound>, or \u201cMaude.\u201d * *If your real name is Maude, and/or you resemble Bea Arthur, this, while lacking in creativity, is fine. 22. You\u2019d rather relive the 9th grade\u200a\u2014\u200awith the added humiliation of headgear and a lazy eye\u200a\u2014\u200athan spend the evening with his family. His family must suuuuuck. 23. He\u2019s a The 700 Club kinda guy and you\u2019re more of an Always Sunny In Philadelphia kinda gal. Or he\u2019s a Fox and Friend\u2019s kinda guy and you\u2019re a sentient being. 24. He\u2019s repeatedly expressed his opposition to the concept of monogamy. You\u2019re married with three kids. 25. He has the mental stability of an arsonist in a toothpick factory with a blowtorch. BONUS: He believes his money/success/hair gives him carte blanche to personify both dickholery and douchebaggery. His untreated personality disorder means he\u2019ll take that as a compliment.
