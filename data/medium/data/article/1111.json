Gorka appeared on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on Wednesday to discuss the president\u2019s approach to terrorism, and in doing so, revealed that he isn\u2019t sure if Trump sees Islam as a religion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a theological seminary, this is the White House, and we\u2019re not going to get into theological debates,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cIf the president has a certain attitude toward a certain religion, that\u2019s something you can ask him, but we\u2019re talking about national security and the totalitarian ideologies that drive the groups that threaten America.\u201d This is the second time Gorka has refused to confirm whether Trump sees Islam as a religion. After being asked if the president believes Islam is a religion on NPR last month, Gorka simply said, \u201cI think you should ask him that question. I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the president.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be controversial to say the president believes Islam is a religion. Islam, in all its various sects, is followed by nearly a quarter of humanity, or 1.6. billion people around the world. It is the world\u2019s second largest religion, and there are about 3.3 million Muslims in the United States. Gorka\u2019s comments came during a conversation about how Trump will be approaching terrorism in his administration. During his first speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Trump repeatedly spoke about the threat of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d \u201cThose are the most, clearest 3 words of his speech: the enemy is radical Islamic terrorism and that has not changed and it will not change,\u201d Gorka said on NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about specific threat groups doing specific crimes, it\u2019s about a global movement, that I like to call global jihadism, and which the president is clear on, it is radical Islamic terrorism, and that\u2019s never changed and it will not change.\u201d Other than using the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Gorka didn\u2019t have a lot of answers for how the president would be approaching terrorism. The only other thing he could point to was Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee resettlement and banning nationals from seven-Muslim majority countries. This ban is not good for national security. Despite Trump\u2019s claim during the speech that foreigners are the largest domestic terrorism threat, right-wing extremists actually pose more of a threat on U.S. soil. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the new National Security Advisor who replaced noted Islamophobe Michael Flynn, has urged Trump to not use the phrase radical Islamic terrorism and told his own staff he finds it \u201cunhelpful.\u201d Neither former presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush used the phrase in order to avoid the idea that militant groups, like ISIS, actually represent Islam. Other national security experts have similarly said the term only furthers xenophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry. Gorka was previously national security editor for Breitbart News, an outlet which embraces white supremacy, and now advises the president on national security. He holds hard line views on Islam, has called racial profiling of Muslims \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and said accepting Muslim refugees would be \u201cnational suicide.\u201d ", "title": "White House adviser isn\u2019t sure if Trump thinks Islam is a\u00a0religion", "sentences": [{"3ad0": "White House adviser isn\u2019t sure if Trump thinks Islam is a\u00a0religion"}, {"8ede": "\u201cIf the president has a certain attitude toward a certain religion, that\u2019s something you can ask\u00a0him.\u201d"}, {"e5f7": "CREDIT: Screenshot/Fox News"}, {"cab1": "Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump focusing on national security, can\u2019t confirm if the president thinks Islam is a religion."}, {"08fe": "Gorka appeared on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on Wednesday to discuss the president\u2019s approach to terrorism, and in doing so, revealed that he isn\u2019t sure if Trump sees Islam as a religion."}, {"2c33": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a theological seminary, this is the White House, and we\u2019re not going to get into theological debates,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cIf the president has a certain attitude toward a certain religion, that\u2019s something you can ask him, but we\u2019re talking about national security and the totalitarian ideologies that drive the groups that threaten America.\u201d"}, {"a802": "This is the second time Gorka has refused to confirm whether Trump sees Islam as a religion.
