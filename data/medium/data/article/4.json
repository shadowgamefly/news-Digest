Let Go Of The Need For Specific\u00a0Outcomes Not everything in life goes exactly how we plan. There are setbacks. Stuff happens. We mess up. Over-obsessing and basing happiness on specific outcomes leads to misery. My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for almost three years. It\u2019s been tough.

Watch your\u00a0language Grateful people use words that ungrateful people don\u2019t use. They often use words like gifts, givers, blessings, blessed, fortune, fortunate, and abundance. Use these words in your vocabulary more and you\u2019ll recognize more things to be grateful for. Additionally, in your language, don\u2019t focus on how inherently good you are. Rather, speak of how good things and other people have been for you. This will allow you to realize the abundance around you. The universe and everyone in it is your advocate. Go through the\u00a0motions Grateful motions include smiling, saying thank you, and writing letters of gratitude. When you do these things, you trigger the emotion of gratitude in your life. Say thank you more often. Say you love people more often. Smile at random strangers as you pass them by. Not only will it make you feel better, it is contagious. People are mirrors. They\u2019ll feel good and smile back. This will create a change reaction of positivity throughout the world. The ripple effects are endless. Think inside the\u00a0box Dr. Emmons recommends creatively looking for new situations and things to be grateful for. What in your life have you not spent time being grateful for? What could you include in your life that will generate an inflow of gratitude?Mix it up. Don\u2019t think gratitude can only come from a narrow set of sources. 5. Say \u201cI Love You\u201d\u00a0More This may be strange, but if you tell your friends and family you love them, they\u2019ll be blown away. I once knew a Polynesian missionary who told everyone he loved them. It was clear he was sincere. I asked him why he did it. What he told me changed my life. \u201cWhen I tell people I love them, it not only changes them, but it changes me. Simply by saying the words, I feel more love for that person. I\u2019ve been telling people all around me I love them. They feel treasured by me. Those who know me have come to expect it. When I forget to say it, they miss it.\u201d Said author Harriet Beecher Stowe, \u201cThe bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.\u201d As my wife, Lauren, tells our children daily, \u201cThe secret to happiness is to make everyone around you happy.\u201d By default, you will get the satisfaction of bringing joy to others and their positive energy will come back to you. 6. Have Hobbies Directed Toward Your\u00a0Dreams Most people\u2019s hobbies are just hobbies. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good to have an escape from reality. However, research has found that a person can experience leisure in anything. Your work can become your leisure\u200a\u2014\u200awhere it literally rejuvenates you. When I decided where I wanted my life to go, my life vision, I consciously chose hobbies that would best get me there. Some of these hobbies include exercise, reading, writing, journaling, having deep and meaningful conversations, and being in nature. These hobbies refresh and rejuvenate me while simultaneously pushing me toward my dreams. 7. Don\u2019t Wait Til Tomorrow For What You Can Do\u00a0Today \u201cWhen I was around thirteen and my brother ten, Father had promised to take us to the circus. But at lunch time there was a phone call; some urgent business required his attention downtown. We braced ourselves for disappointment. Then we heard him say [into the phone], \u2018No, I won\u2019t be down. It\u2019ll have to wait.\u2019 \u201cWhen he came back to the table, Mother smiled. \u2018The circus keeps coming back, you know,\u2019 [she said.] \u201c\u2018I know,\u2019 said Father. \u2018But childhood doesn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aArthur Gordon Happiness comes from embracing the now. Not letting those moments pass you by. Greg McKeown, author of Essentialism, tells of the story of missing his child being born to be at an \u201cimportant meeting.\u201d He thought the potential client would be impressed with his commitment to work. Instead, they saw his decision to miss such a monumental moment as a flaw in character. That moment was a turning point for Greg. In fact, it spurred him to change everything about his life. He now removes everything from his life that is not vital and essential. Nothing in life is permanent. Kids grow up. Friends move away. Our loved ones pass on from this life. Let\u2019s live in the present and appreciate the most important things in our lives before it\u2019s too late. The future value of time is far less than the present value. Yet, people \u201cdefer\u201d happiness to someday in the future. In so doing, they forfeit experiencing the moment and being happiness now. You must find joy in the journey, because there really isn\u2019t a destination. Goals are means, not ends. Progress is eternal. The process is everything. 8. Do Something Every Day That Terrifies You Happy people step out of their comfort zone. You can\u2019t grow if you don\u2019t challenge yourself. And growth is a requirement of happiness. If you\u2019re not growing, you\u2019re slowly decaying and dying. Elevated risk makes you feel more alive and puts you in a state of flow\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is an optimal conscious state where you feel and perform at your highest level. You become completely absorbed in what you\u2019re doing\u200a\u2014\u200apure presence. When you do things way outside your comfort zone, you naturally raise your conscious level. When you do things that involve high risk, and high probability of failure, you are forced to think differently than you normally do. You are forced to be creative and innovative. Sadly, most people play life small, safe, and easy. The goals they pursue are logical. There is little element of risk and little requirement for faith. Consequently, you should take bigger risks in your life. Do things that make you feel alive and activate flow. Of course, with this will come more failures. But if you\u2019re not failing, you\u2019re not growing. Rather than experiencing apathy in life, you\u2019ll experience more of a roller-coaster of emotions. We can never appreciate joy if we\u2019ve never felt sorrow. The more pain and fear we feel, the more we can comprehend and appreciate joy and happiness. 9. Put \u201cThe Important\u201d Before \u201cThe\u00a0Urgent\u201d Stephen Covey says that most people spend their time on urgent but unimportant things. We wake up and immediately check our email. Thus, we put our lives on reactive, rather than proactive mode. After all, email is simply a database of other people\u2019s agendas. Instead, happy people always put the important stuff first. Not only important, but important and non-urgent. The important stuff includes exercise, reading good books, setting goals, writing in your journal, and spending time with those you love. None of these things are urgent. We could easily put these things off until tomorrow\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is ultimately never. The most happy and successful people in the world spend most of their time on the important. One of my favorite non-urgent yet important things is my morning routine. I wake up several hours before I start my work day. I meditate and pray to put myself in a space of gratitude and abundance. Then I get my body moving with exercise or yard work. I eat healthy food, read my long-term goals, listen to uplifting content, and do at least one thing to move me toward my goals. 10. Forgo The Good To Pursue The\u00a0Best A lot of things in life are good, even great. That doesn\u2019t mean we should do them. In Good to Great, Jim Collins says that once-in-a-lifetime opportunities come up every day. Most people take any great opportunity that comes their way, even if it\u2019s not in alignment with their life vision. Consequently, most people\u2019s lives are moving in a thousand different directions. They aren\u2019t able to consciously move forward in a singular direction. On the other hand, happy people say no to even amazing opportunities. They will not sacrifice freedom for security. They will not get derailed by distractions\u200a\u2014\u200aeven sexy and attractive distractions. Very few things in life are best. You can only determine what\u2019s best for you once you know where you want your life to go. Be careful not to continuously engage in good activities and miss the best ones. Conclusion Happy people live in the present. They don\u2019t miss the moments that matter most. They are incredibly grateful for all they have. They focus their lives on the important and essential. They forgo the many good opportunities in order to focus on the few best ones.
