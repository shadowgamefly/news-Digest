{"name": "596", "parent": "", "content": "How Kik Predicted The Rise of Chat\u00a0Bots The messaging app started working on bots years before its competitors. But can it beat the heavyweights of Silicon\u00a0Valley? Waterloo, Ontario, is a boom town. An hour west of Toronto, the city rumbles with construction work. Even the Older Mennonites of St. Jacobs, one town over, are digging up their main street, forcing their horse-and-buggies to detour. The region\u2019s growth stems largely from the University of Waterloo, whose intensive internship programs have made it a magnet for tech recruiting. In the \u201990s the city birthed Research in Motion and its Blackberry platform, which briefly dominated the mobile industry. Today, Waterloo is also a bot town. It\u2019s where Kik Interactive, a seven-year-old startup with a mobile messaging app that\u2019s popular among teenagers, began working on a conversational platform for bots two years ago\u200a\u2014\u200along before the idea became the hot tech trend of 2016 and the latest leg of Facebook\u2019s march to world domination. There\u2019s a crowd of bot-platform contenders right now, including giants like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google and upstarts like Slack, Telegram, and Twilio. But Facebook opened its Messenger to third-party bots in April, and given its reach (close to a billion users) and its resources, it\u2019s the odds-on favorite. The bots will go where the users are, right? But Kik has plenty of users, as well as a billion-dollar valuation, and it sees this story playing out differently. I\u2019ve come to Waterloo to find out why a little Canadian company with 130 employees thinks it can compete in this game and win\u200a\u2014\u200aand why it thinks so many of the bigger players have the whole bot thing wrong. - Hi bot. Tell me what\u2019s special about Kik in the Great Bot Wars of 2016- hold on, I'm checking- OK here's what I got for u- Kik's been working on bots longer than most companies- Kik is all-mobile, it has no older platforms to support- 70 percent of Kik's 300 million users are between 13 and 24 years old, and Kik claims 40 percent market penetration among US teens- Kik has China's TenCent as an investor and partner - Tencent operates China's giant messaging service WeChat This kind of all-purpose, intelligent-assistant role is how most of us envision bots ultimately working: it\u2019s what movies like Her and products like Apple\u2019s Siri have trained us to expect. Kik, however, has something quite different in mind. For Kik, a bot isn\u2019t your automated friend, digital concierge, or omniscient genie. It\u2019s more like the new URL, the universal means of accessing somebody else\u2019s information or service without needing to download or register or sign in. Kik\u2019s bots aren\u2019t AI-powered wonders. They\u2019re more populist than futuristic\u200a\u2014\u200aeverybots for everyman. Populism can be off-putting, of course, and if you just scan the catalogue of available bots on Kik, with their movie tie-ins and product placements, you may recoil from the promotional vibe. Yet I find myself rooting for Kik and its populist vision to succeed against the odds, and you might, too. A world with a monopoly on bot-powered chat is one in which we\u2019re a lot more likely to get messages we don\u2019t want. I drive past Pluto Day Care and hang a right at the Esso station, squinting to spy Kik\u2019s sign. The lime-green logo is on an office-park directory, sandwiched incongruously between listings for a driving school and a personal injury lawyer.

Like its bot-platform competitors, Kik is cobbling together bits and pieces from the half-century history of chatbots, the annals of artificial intelligence, and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d as it tries to solve a big problem: Users want to do more and more with their phones, but they\u2019re downloading new apps less and less often. Chatbots, according to the narrative of the day, are a new \u201cconversational interface\u201d replacing apps (which replaced the browser, which replaced the desktop). Since so many of us are already spending much of our time messaging with human friends, the argument goes, we should not have to leave that environment to do things like summon an Uber ride, move money between banks, or order food. We should tell a bot to do these things, and the bot should make it so. But when I recite that spiel to Ted Livingston, Kik\u2019s affable founder, he pushes back\u200a\u2014\u200anot because he thinks the idea is hype, but because he thinks it\u2019s too narrow. \u201cWe look at chat, very simply, as a better way to deliver software,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to us, customer service and selling items on the web are interesting applications of chat\u200a\u2014\u200abut they\u2019re only a small subset of the type of experiences we\u2019ll be able to deliver.\u201d In the bot gospel according to Kik, chat is the new distribution mechanism for all things digital\u200a\u2014\u200athe portal through which we will access businesses, news, entertainment, games, and personal services, as well as one another. \u201cI think the future is that every interaction will be powered by chat, in the same way that every piece of information is now on the web. It will become the operating system for society.\u201d Livingston\u2019s iconic example is ordering hot dogs and beer from your stadium seat. Forget waiting on line and missing a big play. Forget downloading the ballpark\u2019s app that you\u2019ll almost never use again. Just scan the code next to your seat and message your order to the stadium bot, right from the Kik chat window where you\u2019re already messaging with your friends. When you\u2019re done, it will disappear, until your next visit. \u201cBots are to apps as dating is to marriage,\u201d says Josh Jacobs, president of Kik Services, who works out of Kik\u2019s new Los Angeles office. Thanks to WeChat, this interaction model is already ubiquitous in China, where the bots that represent businesses are known as \u201cofficial accounts.\u201d But it took Kik a few years and false starts to arrive here, including a push to weave partners\u2019 web content directly into chats. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the next room, right over there, and we\u2019re thinking, people don\u2019t want to build web apps, we\u2019ve tried to make it simple for years, it\u2019s not working,\u201d says Livingston. Then, he recalls, his cofounder and CTO Chris Best had an idea: What if apps were chats themselves? \u201cIt was this lightbulb moment that connected a million things.\u201d Two years ago, Kik started inviting other companies to test their bot presences on its network through what it then called \u201cpromoted chats.\u201d In April, Kik launched its new Bot Shop\u200a\u2014\u200aan in-app storefront where users can connect with new bot services (like a personal shopper from H&M) and games (like Arterra, a post-apocalyptic space adventure). A week later, Facebook announced its own new bot platform and bot store at its annual F8 developers\u2019 conference. Kik execs insist they didn\u2019t plan a David-bops-Goliath moment. But they smile as they say it. Screenshot of Kik\u2019s bot\u00a0shop Kik\u2019s bots live inside a chat app, but they don\u2019t really want to chat much with you. It turns out that, for delivering routine information, at least, conversation isn\u2019t very efficient. If you need a daily weather report, for instance, you may not want to wade through a hit-or-miss joke with each forecast. That is exactly what Poncho, a chatbot unveiled at Facebook\u2019s bot launch, provides, and it opened to scathing reviews. (\u201cFrustrating and useless\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGizmodo; \u201cthe slowest way to use the internet\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Verge.). For Kik, the important word in \u201cconversational interface\u201d isn\u2019t \u201cconversation,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cinterface.\u201d \u201cIf you go to our bot shop, almost none of them use the 26-char alphanumeric keyboard,\u201d Livingston says. \u201cThey ask you a question, but then they give you four-five-six buttons as suggestions, and you choose one. What adventure do you want to go on? A B or C?\u201d Almost like\u00a0\u2026 a phone tree? \u201cRight\u200a\u2014\u200ano big deal. But the friction to trying that experience is almost zero.\u201d Interviewing Livingston is similarly modular, like navigating a choose-your-own-adventure story: He keeps helpfully presenting you with options to select. \u201cThere\u2019s the past\u200a\u2014\u200aI can tell you, going back, how we got here. There\u2019s the present\u200a\u2014\u200awhy do I think bots are interesting? Then there\u2019s the future\u200a\u2014\u200alike, open or closed, what do I think will be exciting about bots, what could be worrisome, all that stuff. So where do you wanna go?\u201d I click on \u201cpast,\u201d and Livingston rewinds to the primal tale of Kik\u2019s formative era. In 2010 Kik released a messenger app that worked across iOS, Android, and the then-popular Blackberry, allowing users to communicate regardless of whose device they owned. The company, founded a year before, had set out to create a music app and built the messenger as a tool for sharing songs. But doing deals for music rights took forever, and meanwhile, the messenger went viral, because it let Blackberry users and the burgeoning crowd of iPhone and Android users chat cross-platform for free. It logged a million new users in two weeks\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cfastest adoption in human history,\u201d Livingston says, machine-gunning the phrase as if he\u2019s tired of it. \u201cWe were the first ones through the wall.\u201d Two weeks later, Blackberry booted Kik out of its app store, banned the app from its platform, and sued Kik for patent infringement. The company, it seems, preferred a world where, if you wanted to message a Blackberry user, you needed to buy a Blackberry. \u201cWe were on top of the world, and then one day, with one flick of a switch, it disappeared. All our users who were on Blackberry, or talking to somebody on Blackberry, could no longer use Kik. And that was everybody.\u201d For Kik, it was a rude expulsion from the garden of startup growth. Livingston and his collaborators wandered the wilderness. They\u2019d just raised $8 million from investors. \u201cWe had money, but no users,\u201d Livingston says. Other companies like WhatsApp began moving into the space Kik had opened, and Blackberry gave up trying to stop them, but the damage to Kik was done. That\u2019s when Kik got serious about turning chat into a software platform. Kik\u2019s experience of near-death-by-Blackberry also taught Livingston and company a gritty lesson in the power politics of digital media platforms. It explains why they frame themselves as champions of a bot world that\u2019s open and messy\u200a\u2014\u200aand more than a little like the Web was in its early days. Everyone at Kik, admitting the crudity of today\u2019s bot landscape, talks about the present moment as bots\u2019 \u201cNetscape 1.0, blink-tag phase.\u201d The other parallel with the \u201990s is that Livingston sees a conflict brewing between open and closed visions of botland. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a restaurant, and you launch a bot, will you put that bot on an open platform, where everybody\u2019s on a level playing field, or will you put that bot on the dominant bot platform, where they have complete control and can tax you?\u201d he asks. \u201cRight now it could go either way.\u201d Livingston and Kik are betting on a relatively more open system\u200a\u2014\u200anot because they\u2019re altruists but because they think it will work better, and because they remember what Blackberry did to them. But an early-Web ethos also has its downsides, as Kik has learned all too well. After its fall from Blackberry\u2019s grace, Kik found its way to renewed growth by catering to youth. One reason it appeals to teens is that you can use it anonymously, signing up with any old username rather than a phone number or other traceable ID. Over the years Kik\u2019s name has shared headlines with words like \u201cpredators\u201d and \u201cpornography.\u201d The Daily Dot dubbed Kik \u201cthe king of sketchy messaging apps.\u201d Kik says its problems resemble those of other chat platforms and that it tries to balance protecting users\u2019 privacy and cooperating with law enforcement. Similar issues did not stunt the rise of AOL or Facebook, so it\u2019s safe to assume that they won\u2019t hold Kik back\u200a\u2014\u200aas long as the company addresses incidents in good faith. Credit: Aaron Vincent\u00a0Elkaim The annals of artificial intelligence are shaped by two competing visions. In \u201cweak\u201d or narrow AI, the system simply masters a task\u200a\u2014\u200ait can play chess but not banter with you. With \u201cStrong AI\u201d (aka \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d), a la Hal 9000 or Samantha from Her, the system is adept enough with language and situational awareness to learn and improvise and even impersonate a sentient being. The way Livingston sees it, big companies that have poured money into AI for decades are hoping they can finally see a return on that investment. Thus we have Siri and Cortana and Alexa and Facebook\u2019s M\u200a\u2014\u200aa whole cast of characters vying to serve as our digital majordomos and intelligently cater to our needs and wishes. They will put a friendly voice in front of the yottabytes of cloud data and logic that sit behind today\u2019s search window, and we won\u2019t ever have to type again. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice story,\u201d says Kik\u2019s Josh Jacobs. \u201cIt says, the future is this new kind of technology that requires an army of PhDs to work at your company to compete. Is that true?\u201d To the Google- or Apple-style \u201cone bot to rule them all\u201d scenario, Kik counters with a \u201clet a thousand bots bloom\u201d approach. Mentioning a Kik bot will summon it into a chat, but it won\u2019t pretend to be your friend. \u201cThe bot just pops in and pops out,\u201d says Mike Roberts, Kik\u2019s head of mobile development, who oversaw the launch of the Kik Bot Shop. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit there and listen. You don\u2019t have to worry about what the bot hears, or what it thinks about what else you\u2019re saying.\u201d Jacobs argues that chatbots will be able to solve a problem for us that\u2019s entirely different from the one search engines have mastered\u200a\u2014\u200acall it the housesitter-music dilemma. You\u2019re visiting my home; how do you know how to play a song? Am I an Apple Music user plugged into Sonos, a Spotify subscriber piping tracks through Alexa, or what? \u201cAs we walk around in our daily lives,\u201d Jacobs says, \u201cwe\u2019re coming in and out of networks of available services. And there\u2019s no great interface for detecting, dynamically configuring, and interacting with them, then walking out of their orbit.\u201d For such scenarios, AI might be overkill. It might not even do a great job. Right now the 50-odd offerings in Kik\u2019s Bot Shop are pretty unassuming. They\u2019re not going to end hunger or usher in world peace; they\u2019ll summon a video clip to make you laugh, start a zombie survival game with your friends, or let you chat with a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. It\u2019s all admittedly underwhelming for the dawn of a new era. \u201cPeople ask me all the time,\u201d Livingston says, \u201cshow me a bot that points to this future, and I can\u2019t, not yet.\u201d The web looked pretty underwhelming in the mid-\u201990s, too. But a look at the Kik Bot Shop does make you wonder: What happens when your chat list gets as crowded as your email inbox? Do we really want to invite brands and marketers into the space we use to talk to our friends and family? Isn\u2019t there a possibility, as Buzzfeed\u2019s Nitasha Tiku asked after Facebook\u2019s bot launch, that \u201cusers may not want to chat with airlines and online retailers \u2018like they\u2019re your friend\u2019\u201d? Paul Gray, Kik\u2019s director of platform services, says things only get dicey when marketers treat a bot as if it were a broadcast channel. \u201cThis is not the best tool for marketers to just blast things out. \u2018Oh, great, you can reach users one on one? Let\u2019s send them a message every single day!\u2019\u201d A good bot, Gray says, is one that understands when you\u2019re losing interest. If the bot-driven commercial landscape of the future is going to serve our needs and not just become choked with the bot equivalent of spam, we will want to have some choice among platforms. Businesses will want many different options for designing and building bots. And users will want to preserve the ability to say \u201cno.\u201d Kik may be just another platform company, but today it\u2019s the one that\u2019s most vocal about such principles, and the one that looks most inclined to uphold them. I\u2019d hoped that visiting Kik in Waterloo might give me a concrete glimpse of the bot future, but there isn\u2019t that much to see yet. Kik does run frequent tests with local merchants, and before I left I scanned a code that connected me with the bot for Mel\u2019s Diner. Mind you, this is Mel\u2019s Diner of Waterloo, Ontario\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is not the same as any of the many Mel\u2019s Diners in many other locations, all of whom will no doubt fight in the future over bot-naming rights. When I left Kik\u2019s offices, I was all set to order a hot dog for delivery to my hotel room. The bot worked nicely. But Mel\u2019s offers foot-long hot dogs only, and honestly? I just wasn\u2019t that hungry. Still, I\u2019m happy to report that Mel\u2019s didn\u2019t pester me with a hard sell and hasn\u2019t bothered me since. A well-behaved bot! There just might be hope.

The company, founded a year before, had set out to create a music app and built the messenger as a tool for sharing songs. But doing deals for music rights took forever, and meanwhile, the messenger went viral, because it let Blackberry users and the burgeoning crowd of iPhone and Android users chat cross-platform for free.

The company, it seems, preferred a world where, if you wanted to message a Blackberry user, you needed to buy a Blackberry. \u201cWe were on top of the world, and then one day, with one flick of a switch, it disappeared. All our users who were on Blackberry, or talking to somebody on Blackberry, could no longer use Kik. And that was everybody.\u201d"}, {"7814": "For Kik, it was a rude expulsion from the garden of startup growth. Livingston and his collaborators wandered the wilderness. They\u2019d just raised $8 million from investors. \u201cWe had money, but no users,\u201d Livingston says.

After its fall from Blackberry\u2019s grace, Kik found its way to renewed growth by catering to youth.
