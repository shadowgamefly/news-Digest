{"name": "655", "parent": "", "content": "You Can Change Your\u00a0Story Humans are meant to weather all seasons\u200a\u2014\u200asome of abundance, and others of scarcity. We often learn who we are by trying on the shoes of someone we\u2019re not. We tend to find out what we want by finding ourselves surrounded by everything we don\u2019t want. As we know better, we do better\u200a\u2014\u200ashedding old versions of ourselves like snakes shedding their skin. Mistakes are pathways to self-awareness\u200a\u2014\u200awe, as humans, tend to make a lot of them. There will be times when you end up knee deep in a story that you\u2019re not proud of, but you cannot be happy with the person you are today if you are ashamed of the lessons it took for to become so. You literally could not have learned and grown without the experiences that have shaped you. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to hold onto your story for the rest of your life and play out the same character day in and day out. You have every right to change your story; in fact, you have the responsibility to do so if its ending is no longer serving you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it can be truly convenient staying stuck in your pain. There\u2019s a comfort to your chaos. You know the ins and outs of this feeling because you\u2019ve been festering in it for so long. You know that if you stay stuck in that story, you\u2019ll never win, it will never feel okay\u200a\u2014\u200abut at least you know. You will never get that ex-boyfriend back or fix that friendship, hence there\u2019s nothing new or scary about it. So you hold onto the dead in order to avoid facing the living. Because what\u2019s already gone can\u2019t leave you again. What\u2019s even scarier than loving ghosts? Choosing not to identify with your pain, and instead, marching towards the unknown. Isn\u2019t the root of all human fears the fear of the unknown, anyway? Sure, if you try something new you might fail\u200a\u2014\u200abut if you don\u2019t try, you already have. Where\u2019s the logic in staying stuck? So how do you do it? Well, you can\u2019t pretend the suffering didn\u2019t occur, but you can change your relationship to it. So you focus on the ending. When you change the ending of your story, your pain becomes your wisdom and your mistakes serve as your lessons. You have to surrender to the shame of whatever choices you made or personas you undertook. You have to forgive yourself for not knowing what you know now, and for not acting out of your own best interests. Instead of holding onto your pain, you can choose to take responsibility for your part in it and let it go. Instead of acting from your wounds, you can choose to heal them and move forward. Stop blaming your parents for what they did or didn\u2019t do to you. That\u2019s not saying they don\u2019t deserve it, but blaming other people only keeps you victimized by them. When you release blame, you free yourself to make different choices from those who raised you. You use the awareness of your childhood to explain why there were missing pieces, but you also use it as a pathway to fill the whole puzzle. You also have to know that you deserve the story you want to tell. You have to feel worthy of no longer needing to carry around your wounds, and no longer letting them tarnish everything and everyone they touch. When you let yourself want more, you come to understand all the ways in which you settled for less. And that\u2019s hard to face, but a crucial step if you want to overcome it. When you\u2019re in a hurricane season of your life, you tend to cling onto people who spin just as destructively as you do. Because most healthy people don\u2019t want to open their doors to an active hurricane \u2013\u200athey have too much to lose to collateral damage. That said, when you decide to change your story and move on from self-destructive behaviour, you run the risk of losing loved ones whom you forged strong bonds of mutual suffering with. Despite the fact that you may feel you owe these people for the empathy and safe haven they\u2019ve provided you, you can only carry them forward if they\u2019ve also changed their stories. Everyone has the right to whatever chaos they breed in their life. Along the same vein, everyone also has the right not to be in the middle of a storm. You can\u2019t stand next to a torrential downpour and complain that you\u2019re getting wet. When you rid yourself of the role you\u2019ve been playing, you risk losing a lot of key players that were deeply embedded into your old narrative. This is normal, and although it can be difficult, it\u2019s a sacrifice that\u2019s often necessary to make in order to move on. You can change your story or you can choose to be victimized by it and let it define you. It\u2019s your choice. Taking responsibility for your life isn\u2019t easy, but nothing good ever is. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be worth it, and that it won\u2019t offer you profound wisdom and joy once you\u2019ve reached the other side. You have every right to move on. You have the right to heal and be happy. You have the right to choose healthier people and create better outcomes. You have the right to avoid toxic behaviour and redirect your anxieties. You have the right to be at peace with the past and still show up to your present. Don\u2019t ever feel bad for moving on or letting go\u200a\u2014\u200alife only gets complicated when you get too consumed with loving ghosts.
