{"name": "606", "parent": "", "content": "War Stories: What It\u2019s Really Like Working on AAA Games at\u00a0Ubisoft Or why I quit my dream job to go\u00a0indie Back in 2005, my boss asked me where I saw myself in 10 years. I answered without hesitation: I want to be a software architect on a big-ass AAA project. The dream came to life a few years later when I began working on Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate as\u200a\u2014\u200await for it\u200a\u2014\u200asoftware architect. I was fulfilling my dream of becoming a well-respected game developer, working on a prestigious AAA franchise. Then, I suddenly quit and started a small indie games business with my girlfriend. Some of my friends and family found that move\u2014let\u2019s just say bold. They wondered why I left a safe, well-paying job with tons of advantages, including the excitement and fame of working on the next game everyone will talk about. On my last day at Ubisoft, as I said goodbye to my colleagues, nobody asked why I was leaving to work on my own games. Even people who barely knew me had a pretty good idea. Many were actually envious, although they worked on Syndicate, too, realizing one of their own dreams. I\u2019m sure many professional game developers might have a clue about why I made this move. So I decided to write about the reality of AAA games development, or: How I learned to stop worrying and go indie. Modest Beginnings In 2005, Ubisoft announced it would open a new studio in Quebec City, about 250 kilometers from the famous Ubisoft Montreal studio that created all kinds of obscure games like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Splinter Cell, and Assassin\u2019s Creed. I was recruited on day one, together with about 30 other employees. You can imagine that I was really excited. I celebrated by spending my future paycheck on a brand-new $2,000 guitar. (Five years later, I totally stopped playing guitar. Yeah, not my best move.) Most people who start a career in game development, whether in design, art or programming, are very passionate. They love playing video games, and they love creating them. During my first weeks at Ubisoft, I couldn\u2019t believe I was actually getting paid to do this. It was better than holidays. For the first two years, I worked on small PSP titles: Open Season and Surf\u2019s Up on the Playstation Portable. Those are average games, not especially good or bad, but I had a lot of fun working on them. I learned a lot and made good friends. The teams were pretty small\u2014between 15 and 25 people, if I remember correctly\u2014so everyone knew everyone else. It felt like a little family, and the team spirit was good. In retrospect, we were a bunch of noobs who had a lot homework to do. The thing is, we all wished we could work on bigger projects, AAA projects. It\u2019s not super-glamorous to tell your friends you\u2019re working on some kid\u2019s movie game. Nobody begins a career in video games to work on that kind of title. The PoP\u00a0Years After Surf\u2019s Up, our studio director met us in a conference room. (Yeah, the entire team fit in a single room. Ahhh, the good old days). He announced that our next project would be the Wii version of the upcoming Prince of Persia (PoP) game. I distinctly remember an awkward silence afterward. Nobody knew if it was good or bad news. Then someone shouted, \u201cYES!\u201d Of course, YES. This was way better than our previous projects. It wasn\u2019t Assassin\u2019s Creed, but who cares? I remember being a bit disappointed by the console (at the time, I was super-excited by the PS3 and not so much about the Wii), but overall, it was very good news. The project lasted about three years and became known as Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. It wasn\u2019t a port from the 360/PS3 version. We made a specific version just for the Wii. It\u2019s a really good game. If you didn\u2019t play it back then, go dust off your Wii and give it a try. During my time at Ubisoft, that\u2019s the project I\u2019m proudest of. I had a lot of fun, and I had ownership, meaning I strongly believed that my work had a major impact on the game. My contribution was significant, and I could see it everywhere when I was playing the game. So, obviously, I was super-motivated. I wanted that game to be the most awesome game ever. Most developers know that feeling well. At the team\u2019s peak, we had about 75 developers. A big family, but still a family. Over the course of the project, I interacted with most of them. I\u2019m pretty sure I talked at least once to everyone on the project. You might wonder why I focus so much on team sizes, but more on that later. AC3 WiiU After PoP, I contributed to several games here and there and eventually landed on a technically challenging project: porting Assassin\u2019s Creed 3 (AC3) on the WiiU. This was much different from my previous work. The team was small: two programmers at the beginning, and about 15 or so at the peak. I was excited by the challenge. Most people at Ubisoft didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to pull it off. All Assassin\u2019s Creed titles are intense games in terms of CPU and GPU performance. Believe me, your console is pretty much at its maximum capacity when running around in a big city like Boston or London. The WiiU was less powerful than the PS3 and XBox 360, at least on paper, so the odds weren\u2019t on our side. Even worse: We had to make a straight port\u2014that is, no data changes, just code optimizations. It\u2019s much cheaper to do a straight port than to downgrade all game assets. After about a year, we reached a point where it became obvious that we had successfully ported the game with similar performance as the 360/PS3. It was a huge success. Even Nintendo engineers were surprised we made it. Life was great. The downside was that the second half of the project was relatively boring. The challenge was gone. Port code, fix bugs, and optimize. Rinse and repeat until the game is shipped. I have good memories of this project, but by the end I was ready to do something completely different. Tasting the Forbidden Fruit After AC3, I worked on two internal pitches. For legal reasons, I can\u2019t say much about those projects, but they were so important to me that I need to take some time to talk about them. On the first project, we were a team of about six developers, all very senior. It was a multiplayer game, and our goal was to create a functional prototype in about a month. Our days went somewhat like this: The team spirit was so good! Our motto was \u201con est crinqu\u00e9s!,\u201d which more or less translates to \u201cwe\u2019re so hyped!\u201d During our play sessions, we were so excited that we were screaming and shouting all over the place. I think it bothered colleagues working next to us, but hell, we had so much fun. I didn\u2019t feel too guilty. Since we were such a small team that we had to break down the traditional job barriers. Everyone had their say in the game design. A UI artist made the level design because we didn\u2019t have a level designer with us. I did gameplay programming, which isn\u2019t my speciality at all. (I\u2019m more of a low-level, engine and graphics guy.) But we all really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the project was canceled. Then I started on another internal pitch with an even smaller team: two developers and one producer. This project definitely had that \u201cindie\u201d feeling. It was another multiplayer game, and again we made a pretty awesome prototype in a few weeks. Every day during lunch, we invited everyone in the studio to play. We even organized an internal tournament that attracted around 60 participants. But again, the project was canceled. I was never as happy at Ubisoft as during those two projects. I worked with very talented and motivated individuals. Because of the smaller team sizes, I had my say on the creative side of things. This was a nice change\u200a\u2014\u200abeing more of a technical guy, I could never do that before. And I absolutely loved it. When you work on a small project, your contribution is huge. So is your ownership. And your motivation. One of my former colleagues nailed it when he said that I tasted the forbidden fruit. Once you\u2019ve have that feeling, you can never go back. AC Syndicate The studio received the mandate to lead the next Assassin\u2019s Creed title: Syndicate. We knew the AC franchise well because we collaborated on every title since Brotherhood. However, this was not a collaboration like before. For the first time ever, the Quebec studio, not Montreal, would lead an Assassin\u2019s Creed game. This was a big achievement, but I wasn\u2019t happy at all. The memory of my two beloved projects was still fresh. I knew I\u2019d have to work on AC. There wasn\u2019t any way around it. As predicted, I started working on Syndicate early in the development cycle. I wanted to give it a try even though I feared I wouldn\u2019t like it. At first, since there wasn\u2019t much to do on the technical side, I collaborated a lot on Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity (ACU) with the Montreal studio. I worked on cool new tech developed for ACU, and it was fun and challenging. I got along well with most of my Montreal co-workers (even though it\u2019s harder to develop a good relationship when you communicate mostly by email). I continued collaborating on ACU every now and then until it shipped. After a few months, Syndicate started for real. The team was getting bigger and bigger as we entered production. For me, this is the root of all issues on AAA games: big teams. Too many people. Syndicate was created through collaboration with about 10 studios around the world. This is 24-hour nonstop development. When people go to sleep in one studio, it\u2019s morning in another. With so many people involved, specialization naturally occurs. There\u2019s a lot of work to do, and no one can master all the game\u2019s systems. So people specialize, there\u2019s no way around it. It\u2019s like an assembly line in a car factory: When people realize they\u2019re just one replaceable person on a massive production chain, you can imagine it affects their motivation. With specialization often comes tunnel vision. When your expertise is limited to, say, art, level design, performances, or whatever, you\u2019ll eventually convince yourself that it\u2019s the most important thing in the game. People become biased toward their own expertise. It makes decision making a lot more complicated. More often than not, the loudest voice wins, even if it doesn\u2019t make much sense. On large-scale projects, good communication is, simply put, impossible. How do you get the right message to the right people? You can\u2019t communicate everything to everyone; there\u2019s just too much information. Hundreds of decisions are made every week. Inevitably, at some point, someone who should have been consulted before making a decision will be forgotten. This creates frustration over time. On top of that, often too many people are involved in making a decision. You don\u2019t usually want to make a decision in a meeting with 20 people. That\u2019s inefficient. So the person in charge of the meeting chooses who will be present\u2014and too bad for the others. What\u2019s it going to be? A huge, inefficient meeting where no decision is made, or a small meeting that goes well but creates frustration in the long run? Being an architect, I had a high-level view of all technical developments on the project. While that sounds cool, it has its disadvantages. The higher you go up the ladder, the less of a concrete impact you have on the game. You\u2019re either a grunt who works on a tiny part of the game (\u201cSee that lamppost? I put it there!\u201d), or you\u2019re a high-level director who writes emails and goes to meetings (\u201cSee that road full of lampposts? I approved that.\u201d). Both positions suck for different reasons. No matter what your job, you don\u2019t make a significant contribution to the game. You\u2019re a drop in a glass of water, and as soon as you realize that, your ownership evaporates in the sun. And without ownership, there\u2019s no motivation. I could go on and on. There are tons of other reasons why AAA projects are unsatisfying. Don\u2019t get me wrong: It\u2019s nothing specific to Ubisoft or Assassin\u2019s Creed games. This is an inevitable side effect of creating huge games with an enormous team. I have to add that, obviously, some people are motivated. They are usually juniors and people who never got the chance to work on a AAA project before. But the excitement disappears after you\u2019ve done it a couple of times, and you\u2019re left with the sad day-to-day reality. That\u2019s a huge problem for studios working on one AAA project after another. Senior staff members get tired and leave. Taking the Leap of\u00a0Faith Since my very beginning at Ubisoft, I knew I wouldn\u2019t spend the rest of my days there. I was already dreaming of starting my own indie company. Making my own games. Back then, I didn\u2019t know much about making games. I still don\u2019t know a lot, just a tiny bit more. Indie games don\u2019t suffer from big-project issues. I think the ideal team size is five or six people. That\u2019s when team spirit is highest, as well as ownership and drive. You\u2019re not wasting time with endless email threads and bad communication. There\u2019s a lot less specialization, because a handful of people are doing everything. The job isn\u2019t tedious, and it rewards you every day. For me, going indie also means I can work on nontechnical stuff. I like tech, but I also love the creative aspect of games: gameplay, visuals, sounds, ambiance, the whole experience. Only indie games will let me cover all aspects of the creation process. So that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the number one reason I quit Ubi to make indie games. I\u2019m sure if you ask other developers, they\u2019ll tell you another story. Some of them really like it, I\u2019m sure. Others might be unhappy for a completely different reason. For me, this leap of faith was the right and only thing to do.
