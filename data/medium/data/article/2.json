{"name": "2", "parent": "", "content": "How I left my consulting career behind and broke into\u00a0tech Three months ago, I moved to San Francisco\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the most expensive cities on Earth\u200a\u2014\u200awith no job, no housing, and barely any money. Plenty of people thought it was crazy. They\u2019d thought I was crazy to leave behind a prosperous career in consulting five months ago, and they really thought I was crazy now. But here I am. Today I have a dream role at a startup as a Product Manager building out a mobile application with people I love. So how did I get here? And, more importantly, why do you care? This isn\u2019t a how-to article, but rather a knowledge drop of all the things I experienced over the past few months, and everything I\u2019ve learned from those experiences. Always keep in mind that the world is ever-changing. Don\u2019t let yourself lag behind. This is my\u00a0story It was September 27, 2016. After months of contemplating the big move, I called my friend Prateek. I was seeking guidance, as he made a similar move roughly a year prior. I told him of my plans to try and get into a coding bootcamp like Hack Reactor or App Academy to hone in on my technical skills, so I could eventually be better suited for a product management role. He then put me in contact with his friend Artur, with whom I scheduled a call shortly after. Artur made a transition into software engineering from investment banking, after attending Hack Reactor. I told Artur the same thing I told Prateek. What he said next sealed the deal, and my mind was made up. \u201cDude, you don\u2019t need to do that. If you\u2019re willing to spend that money, why don\u2019t you just come out to SF, line up interviews, and simultaneously look for a job? Get the initial experience you need elsewhere.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing his words, but you get the idea. Artur kick-started what would become one hell of a journey for me, and a friendship between Artur, his twin brother, Timur, and Ruben\u200a\u2014\u200athe Breaking into Startups crew. A couple of days later, I had coffee with a professor from Georgia Tech, whose class I took in college. He\u2019d been a mentor ever since, so I figured he could provide some insight. Boy, was I right. It turns out that he\u2019d made a similar move out to California, with little to no money, and couldn\u2019t have advocated for it more. He constantly referenced it as one of the best decisions of his life. As I drank the last bit of my cappuccino, he offered to introduce me to any of his connections on LinkedIn I felt I could resonate with. My professor had sparked an undiscovered passion that would change my life\u200a\u2014\u200abuilding relationships. Professor\u200a\u2014\u200aI wanted to take the time to thank you here. I owe you one. It was now mid-October, and after speaking with Artur and my professor from college, I knew getting more product management experience was essential. I was a consultant\u200a\u2014\u200agood at what I did. I had even run my own startup in college, but nothing that directly correlated to a product role in tech. Lightbulb. My friend Christian Zimmerman, the founder of Qoins, had just started to get off the ground with his startup. They\u2019re basically the Acorns of debt\u200a\u2014\u200aa product I could get behind and definitely a great opportunity to gain some experience. I hit him up and pitched to him to let me \u201cconsult and be on a contract\u201d as a Product Manager for them. I\u2019d work for free, and they\u2019d pay for my parking. Here\u2019s a snippet of some of the work I helped them with. We took their old website and really dove into what information users wanted, how to get users to signup, and how to keep them coming back (growth and retention rates, for my product folks). Through the redesign and a launch of the iOS app, we were able to decrease the user bounce rate by 10%, increase total signups by ~31%, and active users by ~69%. Truthfully, I\u2019m still contemplating whether we picked the right definition for an active user\u200a\u2014\u200abut this topic is for another day. What a steal for them, right? And all for just $15 worth of parking. Well, it might have been a steal for them, but I couldn\u2019t have been more grateful. I credit most of my interviews and coffee meetings to this experience, but more on that later. Experience was a major player, and there\u2019s always room for more of it. If you don\u2019t have it, find a way to improvise for it. It may not be through a job, but a side project, cheap contract role, or even just helping out a friend. It can all prove to be valuable down the line. Win small. November 4th was my last day as a consultant in Atlanta. I had two more months in the city I call home, and then I\u2019d be moving out to San Francisco. After budgeting, I had about six months worth of cash to spend. There was no turning back now. One week had gone by. Holy. Hell. It started to settle in. Did I make the right decision? I started to get nervous. The adrenaline rush of quitting my job had worn off. The fear of the unknown started to foster. Time out. Let\u2019s take a second to talk about \u201cthe fear of the unknown.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most primitive and dominant emotions for human beings. Uncertainty causes an uneasiness in people. But how do we get over this? Well, the answer is subjective, but here\u2019s what I did. Wow. One month of unemployment had flown by, and at this point, I was willing to take anything that sounded cool and try to laterally move my way into a Product Manager role from there. Silly, right? Only one month, and I\u2019m already willing to compromise my dream. I had interviewed with Uber, Workday, DoorDash, and multiple other startups. I made it to the final rounds for most of them. There were two where I walked away from the process. The rest ended in flat-out rejections\u200a\u2014\u200ain some cases from companies where I\u2019d been so certain that I\u2019d crushed it during the interview. Upon asking for feedback, this is what I received and some of my immediate thoughts\u200a\u2014\u200ahumor me: \u201cYou were a great candidate, but don\u2019t have the years of experience we want.\u201d What? Come on. Who is ever going to have 5+ years of experience for a role where you\u2019re hiring a fresh college graduate? \u201cWe decided to pursue other candidates whose qualifications better fit our needs at this time. We hope that you consider us again for employment in the future.\u201d The future? I want to be employed now. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel you are a perfect fit for the [position]. That being said, we are rapidly growing and our needs are constantly changing, so please feel free to keep an eye on our careers page and apply to any positions that are of interest to you.\u201d Okay. I might have blown this interview, but really? Completing a take-home exercise for hours on end, only to receive this in response\u200a\u2014\u200asoul crushing. Dramatic, I know. [Silence] [Crickets] [More Silence] Yeah, that was after three follow up emails. Why me? At this point, you could say I was feeling pretty bitter. What am I doing so wrong that I can make it to most final interviews, but then let the offer slip right through my hands? Do I suck at closing? Am I saying something wrong during these interviews? While I certainly responded emotionally on my end, I think it\u2019s important to point out, everybody has thoughts like these. Rejection is tough. It provokes an emotional responses. But, that\u2019s okay\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re only human. Read on. I\u2019ll explain to you what I did to combat this and how little it actually affected me later on, because trust me, the rejection definitely didn\u2019t stop to care about my feelings. Still in Atlanta, I asked my old college advisor if she would meet me for coffee (there\u2019s a theme here). She had given me quite a bit of advice throughout college\u200a\u2014\u200aI figured why not now? Nonetheless, meeting with her was a pivotal moment in the \u201cfunemployed\u201d lifestyle I\u2019d fearfully started to become more comfortable with. She dropped two pieces of advice on me: LinkedIn\u2019s Alumni Page Feature: Search for the college you attended/graduated from. Go to \u2018See Alumni.\u2019 Now you can sort through alumni in different cities, companies, job roles, etc. It\u2019s one of the easiest tools to find alumni to reach out to\u200a\u2014\u200aa huge contributing factor to how I built more relationships. \u201cA good job search is a huge list of no\u2019s and one yes. It only takes\u00a0one.\u201d This was the single piece of advice that kept me moving with each rejection I received. I could get one \u201cyes.\u201d The right yes. A few more days trickled by. I decided to kick it up a notch. Speaking with my college advisor made me realize I needed to meet as many people as I could, face to face. Impulse decision\u200a\u2014\u200abut I booked my ticket to San Francisco STAT. I know\u2026 dicey. I was banking on actually getting these meetings. But sometimes, knowing you have everything to lose is all the motivation you need. My goal was to send 50 cold emails/LinkedIn messages a day to people I think I could learn from. So ambitious. Yeah, that quickly dropped to 25 messages a day. I noticed at 50, the quality of my emails became poor. I wasn\u2019t doing enough research on the person I was emailing beforehand and was essentially using a cookie cutter email template. Therefore, my response rate was low. Really low. After the adjustment, I sent out 25 messages a day, Monday through Friday until January 6th. That\u2019s 15 days, 365 messages. Out of 365 messages, I ended up with 75 coffee meetings and phone calls. That\u2019s a ~21% cold message to coffee meeting/phone call conversion rate. My calendar was scary\u200a\u2014\u200aa lot of meetings which I didn\u2019t even note down, because they happened literally hours after I had scheduled them. Flexibility is\u00a0key. My response rate drastically increased. You\u2019d be so surprised how willing people are to help you out if the interest conveyed is genuine. In the midst of all that was going on\u200a\u2014\u200atwo days before the New Year, I received news that one of my best friends and past co-founder, Alex Prinzi, had passed away. Look, some things you just can\u2019t prepare for. It was a whirlwind of a day, and I debated writing about such a personal experience here. But Alex, and his twin brother, Leo, played such an integral part in my life from the entrepreneurial experiences we shared together (running our startup, Wazo, and provisionally patenting Cheer Straps), to the genuine friendship, unintentional mentorship, and camaraderie I grew to have for these two. Everybody should find something that motivates them to do better than they did yesterday. For me, part of that was Alex\u200a\u2014\u200athe man who lived life to the fullest. It would be an incomplete story without mentioning him. I wouldn\u2019t be half of where I am today without him. Miss ya, buddy\u200a\u2014\u200athis one is for you. In loving memory of the legend, Alexander Joseph\u00a0Prinzi. The Friday before I was supposed to fly out to SF, I made a spur of the moment decision to drive out to Houston with a friend through the night, stay the weekend, and fly out of there the following Monday. It was cheaper. I was trying to save money. Is this relevant to the story? Nope. But not everything about looking for a job is about looking for a job. I still had a life. It was D-Day. I boarded my plane. It started to take off, and it hit me like a wall. I was going to be leaving great pay, great people, and 24 years worth of experiences back in Atlanta. I\u2019m actually doing this. Everything I had planned is now in full-swing. It\u2019s time to prove to myself and everybody else if I could actually make it. I\u2019m doing it live\u200a\u2014\u200ano looking back now. During the flight, I realized nobody knows me in SF. I need a way to get my face across to thousands of people quickly. But how? LinkedIn. I typed up a post that probably took me the whole flight to come up with, and even then, it was pretty horribly written. But screw it, I decided to post it when I landed anyways, and see where it goes. We touched ground, and I immediately called an Uber to my buddy Prateek\u2019s place. He so graciously allowed me to crash in his closet. No, seriously. I lived in a closet for a month. Ignore the picture of a picture. I was using Snap Spectacles to show what I was actually living\u00a0in. To paint a picture\u200a\u2014\u200ait pretty much fit a twin size air mattress and my two suitcases. That\u2019s it. Oh, and I had to walk through the bathroom to get to it. It was an interesting place to stay for one month, but I did what I had to keep costs as low as possible. Thanks Prateek. Seriously. The very next day, the daily grind of coffee meetings, phone calls, and interviews began. What do I say when I meet these people? What\u2019s the end goal of each meeting? How do I make sure they do what they say they will do? Speaking with people you have never met can be extremely intimidating, let alone people who may be far more experienced than you. Somethings that helped me prepare for these meetings (sometimes with quite a learning curve), I\u2019ll list below. Find everything online about the person you\u2019re meeting and read! I looked through their LinkedIn, their past positions, companies sold, their interests, where they\u2019ve lived\u200a\u2014\u200aI even found an email address through a picture someone posted on Twitter in 2014. Yeah, I felt pretty creepy, but understanding what they have done only gives you more points to connect within a conversation. People love to talk about themselves. Use that to your advantage. Thank them and show appreciation when you meet them. The very first thing I did, almost every time, was show them I cared that they came out to speak with me. Thanks [name], I appreciate you taking the time to come out and speak with me. It means a lot. People respond differently to questions. Understand what they want. Some people I met loved open-ended questions, where they\u2019d go on for 30 minutes talking about themselves. Others loved pointed questions, for which they could answer quickly (think rapid fire). Honestly, I played it by ear and threw one or two of each at them to find out where they stood. Okay. That\u2019s all good and dandy, but how do I get something out of it? Learn to hate networking. Build relationships. I couldn\u2019t stress this enough. Meeting people while on the job search doesn\u2019t need to be transactional. Build the relationship with the person, and something will come of it in the future. Everybody has needs, you\u2019d be surprised how quickly you can make yourself a fit. The more people you foster a genuine relationship with, the more will flock to you. I call this the 10x Effect (part of a phrase I stole from a few friends). It\u2019s a matter of taking the time to build the foundation with each person you come across. Eventually, it becomes second-nature. The goal is to get another meeting (whether it\u2019s with them or someone else). At the end of every meeting, I asked the same question. Is there anybody else you feel like I should reach out to? The way you ask this question matters. If you ask them if THEY can introduce YOU to someone\u200a\u2014\u200awell, that adds a level of unneeded pressure. Chances are they do have someone in mind, but they want to feel as if they are in control of their own actions. Give them that control. When you say, YOU\u2019D be happy to reach out to people THEY may know\u200a\u2014\u200amore often than not, they\u2019ll say one of two things: 1. I think [name] would be great for you to chat with, I\u2019ll introduce you to them myself. Great. You now have something to follow up with on and a potential next meeting set. 2. Hmm\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure right now. I can\u2019t think of anybody. Don\u2019t fret. This could be a legitimate thing. It\u2019s tough to just spitball names off the top of your head. It\u2019s easy to respond in this situation. It\u2019s no rush. To make this easier for you, I\u2019d be happy to connect with you on LinkedIn and send you an email if there\u2019s anyone I think would be great to learn from. Yeah, sure\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s do that. Now, you have a reason to follow up with a name or two of people they know that might be of interest to you. Again, can\u2019t stress this enough\u200a\u2014\u200atry not to make this transactional. It pays ten fold to maintain relationships. A prime example unfolds later on in my story. Remember that post I created for LinkedIn? Here\u2019s a screenshot of it. It\u2019s nothing fancy\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a cheesy piece of writing with a nice picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. 52 comments. 502 likes. ~200,000 views. Pinch me. It worked. It really worked. Because of this post, I received numerous recruiter phone calls, hundreds of people offering to help, and a countless number of people encouraging me on\u200a\u2014\u200aall from a stupid post I wrote up on the airplane over to San Francisco. I even had one guy offer to house me. Being active on LinkedIn is crucial\u200a\u2014\u200aboth during your job search and even once you\u2019ve landed a job. I could only imagine how many people this post would have reached had I continued to build a presence on LinkedIn throughout my entire career (instead of just when I was looking). Again\u200a\u2014\u200aI just want to point out how underutilized LinkedIn actually is. Use it. Pushing three weeks into West Coast living, I met Eusden. I had reached out to him via a cold email about two weeks prior. He had a solid PM background at Pinterest and Hulu\u200a\u2014\u200athought I might be able to learn a thing or two from picking his brain. We met at Bravado, the coffee shop right across the street from AT&T Park. We had a normal conversation, nothing too mind blowing. Eusden was great to speak with and promised a few introductions to a few friends of his. Awesome\u200a\u2014\u200ajust what I was looking for. Time flew by, and I was nearing three months of unemployment. I was getting close\u200a\u2014\u200aor, so I thought. As mentioned earlier, I had about 75 coffee meetings and phone calls through the month of January. I landed 9 total interviews and 6 final interviews. Hell yeah. I\u2019m killing it. I prepped like a mad man for those interviews. It was time to go crush them in the next couple of weeks. A couple of more days trickled by. I had just gotten off the phone with Eusden. He offered me a contract role to work at the startup he is advising. What? That was random. Do I take it? Is it worth it? Yup\u200a\u2014\u200aI took it. It was a more than generous hourly pay, and I could certainly use the cash to keep my savings afloat. In addition, the mutual understanding between us was simple. Really, this was the best situation for me to be in, but I was far too naive to realize it at the time. 6 final interviews, right? I might as well have had egg on my face. Rejection. Rejection. Rejection. Rejection. Walked away from offer. I\u2019m an idiot. Rejection. I received 5 rejections and walked away from one offer, over the span of two days. Come on! What in the world was I doing wrong? Let\u2019s talk about Imposter Syndrome for a second. At this point, I felt like I was a fraud. I had come up with a million and one ways to get these interviews (building a product of my own, helping Qoins, etc.), all of which were legit\u200a\u2014\u200abut every time I failed to get an offer. I started to believe I was faking the hard work I had put in. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In hindsight, I did everything right. Sure, I bombed one interview so bad, but the other 4? Well, the truth is there are so many external factors that you cannot control\u200a\u2014\u200atrying to justify it will drive you insane. Instead, ask for feedback and move on. Additionally, spinning your outlook on these events can drastically change how you perform/tackle the next interview. For example, these rejections helped me realize what companies in the Valley are looking for in a PM. I started to pick and choose different tactics that worked at like-minded companies. It ends up panning out for me in the future. Back to thinking I was doomed\u200a\u2014\u200aI panicked. What do I do now? How can I convey that I\u2019m not just good, but great? Build. My good friend Kevin (whom we all call Guebert AKA Goobs) and I had been toying around with the idea of an Amazon Alexa dating app for a while. Well, the opportunity struck. He called me up on Sunday night and convinced me we should apply to Voicecamp. The application was due on the 28th. *Facepalm* \u201cGoobs, we practically have one night to complete\u00a0this.\u201d He somehow convinced me. We stayed up late that night and cranked out an Alexa dating app we named, Vocado. It was pretty much a really crappy, highly NON-functional prototype\u200a\u2014\u200afor which we shot a lame homemade video to go along with it. Submit. It was the waiting game from here on out, but we had zero expectations of actually getting the first interview. It was the beginning of March. I was at work (my contract gig), I opened my phone to 5 missed calls and 3 missed texts from Goobs. That\u2019s unusual\u200a\u2014\u200athe hell does he want to talk to me so bad for? No freaking way. I was bugging out. I called him immediately. We had made it through the initial screening and were asked to schedule an interview. We couldn\u2019t believe it. We crushed it, right? LOL. I\u2019ll cut to the chase. After a few questions, it was very apparent we weren\u2019t going to get through to the next round. We had zero business model, no real working prototype to download or in an App Store to show\u200a\u2014\u200awe made this in one night for Pete\u2019s sake. But, that\u2019s okay. It taught us a few things. We were scrappy enough to get something off the ground in one night to get the attention of someone willing to invest in our product. Talk about product validation. Goobs and I work together well. What else could we make? But most importantly, I now had another product to showcase in interviews and conversations. And damn, was this one a winner. Being able to put this down on my resume almost always sparked a conversation in interviews. You built a dating app for Alexa? Yup\u200a\u2014\u200ain one day (to be read in Dr. Evil\u2019s voice from Austin Powers). It was at this moment where I learned the value of just doing it. You want to be a software engineer? Write code for something. You want to be a growth hacker? Growth hack something. You want to be a Product Manager? Ship something. Just go do it. By mid-March, things were going smoothly. I had learned from my experiences and mistakes and had finally come up with 4 more final interviews. By this time, I had answers from 3 of those final interviews: 1 Rejection 2 Offers The last interview was pending for the week after next. Finally. Things were starting to look good. Oh, do you remember Eusden? Yeah, something interesting happened. That same Friday, Eusden threw a curveball at me. He offered me a full-time PM role at the startup I had been contracting to. The guy I reached out to through a cold email, then grabbed coffee with, then contracted for the startup he was advising, just offered me a full-time role. Well, damn\u200a\u2014\u200ado I take it? For the first time in a while, I had a good problem on my hands. March 29th was a glorious day for me. It felt like a thousand pounds of pressure were lifted off my shoulders. I had turned down two offers, walked away from the last final interview, and I accepted Eusden\u2019s offer. I couldn\u2019t be happier. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWhen it rains, it\u00a0pours.\u201d A day after I had accepted my offer\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook and 2 other startups reached out to me offering interviews and wanting to chat. Great. Now what? Nothing. I established a relationship with those recruiters that reached out and moved on. I was happy. I loved the startup, loved the people I was working with, had the role I wanted, and most of all, could finally say I enjoyed what I was doing. There was no reason for me to back out. I know I had made the right decision. It was so close to April Fools that I began questioning reality. But as I started the first day of my first week on the job, a new chapter of my life began. It felt great. I enjoyed this day. I basked in it. What I Continue to do\u00a0Today The Gems AKA Resources and Knowledge Drops Unconventional moves require unconventional strategies.
