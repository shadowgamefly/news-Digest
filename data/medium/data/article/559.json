Less than a mile down the road lay a rocky beach, along Lake Michigan\u2019s shore. The guests throw rice, as man and wife exit through doors adorned with stained glass windows. The sun shines to honor the occasion. On Sunday mornings, the organist plays familiar refrains and songs, while the waves tumble the rocks on the beach. It\u2019s rare with the aging congregation, but occasionally a baby receives eternal life through the rite of baptism. Some cry at the wet intrusion upon their heads, while others sleep through it all. In the church basement, volunteers prepare coffee and set out desserts, while the organ booms from the balcony two floors above. Mourners watch, as the casket is slid into the hearse. The country church witnesses the circle of life. And, as lives continue to circle, the waves continue to roll.
