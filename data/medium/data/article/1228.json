{"name": "1228", "parent": "", "content": "Greetings From Hawaii Where I Went The Day After I Found Out You\u00a0Cheated I found a chaise lounge by the Sheraton Pool. You have to have a wristband to get a towel and get poolside service. I needed to go to a straw hut across the lazy river to show my room key and get the stupid wristband. I didn\u2019t want to lose the spot I found, but I didn\u2019t have anything besides my clothes to mark my territory. I would have to take them off and leave them to not lose the chaise. I wasn\u2019t planning on removing my cut offs and top today, but I had to make a decision: Was standing in front of countless strangers in my bathing suit worth claiming the chair? It wasn\u2019t.It was such a mistake. I stood there feeling completely nakedI felt so exposed and so humiliated and disgusting.\u00a0My body was the evidence of the things I\u2019ve done to myself. I lost everything. And the map showing why, and how, was drawn out across my skin for everyone to\u00a0see. I took a deep breath and said fuck\u00a0it. I channeled some body language that I remember coming naturally when I was proud\u200a\u2014\u200aparroting how a confident woman behaves. I pulled my bikini bottoms out of my ass,tightened my top,\u00a0walked with my hips swinging,\u00a0legs as long as I can make them,\u00a0toes pointed,\u00a0straight posture,\u00a0shoulders back and head high.\u00a0Trying to avoid eye contact with all the fucking people on the journey to the fucking hut and it fucking sucked. They make the people working at the wristband-hut say \u201caloha\u201d to every person who approaches. The line is long and around the fifth time I hear \u201caloha\u201d I laugh. It reminded me of being at CVS with you, buying you some deodorant for your trip then I think of your\u00a0trip\u2026 I must have been still thinking of it the second time the woman said \u201caloha\u201d to me. I apologized and shook my head to indicate to her that I was clearly daydreaming, and wasn\u2019t intentionally ignoring her. I say \u201caloha,\u201d and I \u201csmile.\u201d Or whatever I\u2019m calling it now, the respectful thing where I show my teeth. Faking it so she doesn\u2019t think the thoughts and images in my eyes are directed at her. She talks and I don\u2019t care about what she is saying, but I do the thing with the teeth again and say thank you. I have the wristband and the striped towel that only members have, so now I won\u2019t be kicked out. Not kicked out like the young couple with the plain towels and the baby named Paisley. I feel bad for them, so did the security guard and everyone around. We all intentionally didn\u2019t turn our heads to watch them gather their things and leave. Oh great another baby. I need to get in the pool or do something. I stand up, again in just my bathing suit. Okay here I go\u00a0again. Walking,\u00a0chin up,\u00a0tummy in,\u00a0hiding in the I WANT TO DIE, I WANT TO DIE slouch\u2026 I make it to the steps and jump in before anyone sees. There are these really nice bean bags that float that you can use for free, you just have to find one. Again there are people scavenging for the open opportunity but I\u2019m really lucky. Lucky haha what a stupid thing to\u00a0think But I am really lucky and find one right away. Really lucky when it comes to chairs and bean bags. I\u2019m gonna try something new and just do the fun stuff \u201cnormal people\u201d do. I don\u2019t remember the last time I floated around in a tube.But then I do, I remember, and I laugh about making that joke with the DVDs at the liquor store afterwards and wonder if you have that picture still. I shake my head again, literally, and look down at my body crumpled up in the float. I count all the other women in each spot on my leg or line in my\u00a0stomach. I have to channel confident lady again or I\u2019ll drown myself. This time I start to notice the people and let myself notice the way they notice me.\u00a0I\u2019m being ridiculous.\u00a0I\u2019m the worst I\u2019ve ever looked, but the best looking person here. I feel like an asshole for thinking that but it\u2019s true. I see all the men.\u00a0They stare at me,\u00a0through sunglasses,\u00a0behind their wives backs,\u00a0in covert body contortions,\u00a0in honest smiles.\u00a0One man listening to Bob Marley tipped his hat at me approvingly. It\u2019s the bathing suit with the rasta colors. I let myself feel them look, it feels good but for the wrong reason. They are all exactly what I thought and I let myself see it.\u00a0Everyone of them are awful and disgusting. I remember that the best looking woman in the pool doesn\u2019t stand up against the sea of women out there in the world. So I think of those women, and look at these women. The old ones smile,\u00a0the heavy ones snarl,\u00a0the pretty ones look down at themselves, take a deep breath, and channel whatever they need to look back up. Everyone is sad and disgusting. I wish you were here and then dunk my head under water for thinking\u00a0it. I go back to my chair, I need some water and lunch. Now there are two guys in the chairs next to me.\u00a0I hate them already. They see me coming.\u00a0They get excited.\u00a0They smile. I don\u2019t do the thing with the teeth I just say \u201chi\u201d and lay down. I put a book over my stomach so they can\u2019t see all of your mistakes on me. I put a book over my stomach so they can\u2019t see all of your mistakes on\u00a0me. My ahi poke bowl comes with soy sauce. My ahi poke bowl comes with soy\u00a0sauce. I can\u2019t eat soy sauce anymore since you pointed out the fruit flies that are always in the soy sauce bottles of the sushi restaurants we go to. I hate myself for eating. I go throw up. I go throw\u00a0up. I come back and this time I do the teeth thing for the pigs. I realize I\u2019m being mean so I stop hating them, they feel that I stopped hating them, so they engage. They ask how the poke was. I say it was alright and feel ashamed about throwing up. They ask if I want a drink and I say I don\u2019t drink (now), but thanks.\u00a0We do that thing you do when you meet someone new. You know. They are from Philly, which makes me think about getting slapped.\u00a0They play baseball which makes me laugh out loud for the first time today. It\u2019s hot. We are all three sweaty and they ask if I want to go in the water with them. I do. The attention is making me feel better, and I like that they don\u2019t know me, which makes me think about how good this made you feel too. We float the river a few times around. I go down a water slide to seem fun and it actually is fun.\u00a0I told them I\u2019m from LA and decided that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say now.\u00a0I\u2019m not from San Francisco anymore.\u00a0I\u2019m from LA. They ask if I\u2019m married and I say no. They aren\u2019t either. They don\u2019t ask if I have a BF which makes me think they have girlfriends so I go back to hating them.\u00a0They like being seen with me, and switch off who engages more because they haven\u2019t decided which one gets me. I feel bad for not telling them it\u2019s neither and that I\u2019m using them.\u00a0Then I just decide to go for it and take what I wanted. I tell them everything. It takes over an hour.\u00a0I stop for breaths to see if they are still listening. I wouldn\u2019t have cared if they weren\u2019t because it\u2019s not about them, but they were:\u00a0mouths dropped,\u00a0eye contact,\u00a0sympathy,\u00a0gasps\u200a\u2014\u200ait wasn\u2019t fake. I finish and feel gross for doing something vulnerable with them, but good for getting what I needed. And it was with strangers so I can walk away and never care again what they think about it. We walk back to the chair in silence and sit down and I start laughing at myself and they start to console me. They tell me I\u2019m wrong, not every man is like that.\u00a0They tell me I\u2019m beautiful. And it just makes me think of how you said that to the others, and how I can\u2019t ever hear it again because it\u2019s either a lie or that I\u2019m beautiful but not beautiful enough. Their consoling feels empty and it makes me just want to talk to\u00a0you. I tell them that and start to type this to you. They come back with a Mai-Ti and leave it by my side. They say \u201cJust in case you change your mind, here you go\u201d and they give me their room number and it makes me want to barf because there it is\u2026 I hate everyone but at least I got a tan\u2026 ", "title": "Greetings From Hawaii Where I Went The Day After I Found Out You\u00a0Cheated", "sentences": [{"3717": "Greetings From Hawaii Where I Went The Day After I Found Out You\u00a0Cheated"}, {"ba88": "I found a chaise lounge by the Sheraton Pool."}, {"5d5e": "You have to have a wristband to get a towel and get poolside service.
