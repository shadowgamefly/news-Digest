But Trump has more than a hundred other federal judicial vacancies to fill across the United States, an unprecedented number that is the result of GOP obstructionism in the Senate in Obama\u2019s last two years in office. Facing more judicial vacancies than any other president entering office, Trump has the opportunity to change the make-up of the nation\u2019s federal courts for generations. Transcript: VICTORIA FLEISCHER, ThinkProgress: When Trump became President, he inherited 107 federal judicial vacancies, essentially twice the number Obama inherited. That\u2019s in large part because in 2015, the Republican majority Senate began refusing to confirm any of Obama\u2019s appointments. Remember Merrick Garland? Well, he\u2019s only one of 52 judicial nominees during Obama\u2019s presidency who never received a vote. All told, there are 874 federal judges in the United States, including the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s nominations only need simple majority in the Senate to be confirmed. And with the vacancies alone, Trump can appoint about 14 percent of all federal judges for the lifetime appointments. Take into account the number of judges coming up for retirement, and Trump\u2019s judges could make up to one half of the Appellate Court. TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m going to appoint conservative judges, I\u2019m gonna appoint people that have great reputations, that are great with the legal profession. STEPHANOPOULOS: Like? FLEISCHER: Trump hasn\u2019t provided much intel on his potential appointments, but we do know a little. He promised on the campaign to appoint only pro-life conservatives to the Supreme Court, which was instrumental in securing the evangelical vote. And he\u2019s pledged that his judges will \u201call be picked by the Federalist Society,\u201d an influential group of conservative lawyers. Trump is looking to appoint judges who are young and have less experience, ensuring the president\u2019s influence on the judicial branch for decades. And that influence will have the greatest effect at the Circuit Court level. While the Supreme Court only hears about 75 cases a year, the court of appeals decides tens of thousands. Which means that often, the lower courts have the final say on the rule of law, creating a far reaching sphere of influence over the daily lives of Americans. For example, both of Trump\u2019s travel bans were deemed unconstitutional, the first by an appellate court judge and the second by district judges. And just last month, the District Court for the 5th Circuit ruled that Texas\u2019s gerrymandering of their congressional districts was unconstitutional because it targeted minority voters. The judges Trump nominates are likely going to preside over contentious debates like gun control, voting rights, civil liberties and abortion, to name a few. So Trump\u2019s appointments will likely establish a new conservative precedent across the United States.
