It\u2019s the reason people cite for not reading as much: or not rereading their favourite books. I\u2019ve said in other blogs, if you want to read (or reread) a book you\u2019ll make time. Watch less TV, don\u2019t play that latest craze app on your phone: why not listen to an audiobook version while you drive or go for your morning walk/run? Reread that favourite book of yours, the one you\u2019ve been thinking about rereading for a while now: do it, you\u2019ll be thankful you did. With so many good unread books around, why\u00a0reread? I say: why not both. Why not reread and read new books? For me every 2 years I reread Harry Potter. And every year I reread \u201cThe Name of the Rose\u201d, \u201cOn the Road\u201d and \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d. Every year. \u201cThe Name of the Rose\u201d (by Umberto Eco) is one of those fine novels that teaches you something, makes you think and still has time to be an entertaining, page-turning medieval murder mystery. It\u2019s also a good introduction to the author\u2019s view on semiotics and how to interpret/read texts. \u201cOn the Road\u201d (by Jack Kerouac) is\u200a\u2014\u200afor me\u200a\u2014\u200aabout wanderlust. The desire to go, go, go and keep moving. The book\u2019s jazz prose and unreliable narrator also make the book interesting: the less you trust the narrator the more interesting the book becomes. \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d (by Hunter S Thompson) is dark humour, and road trip American dream satire. The perverse philosophical outlook is a good reminder that reading should be fun, and that to live well, one cannot take life seriously all the time. So, why reread a\u00a0book? A book worth reading is a book that makes you laugh in all the same places each time you read it. Or it shows you something you didn\u2019t see the first time around. A book worth rereading will teach you more, show you more and help you to appreciate the fine detail in a story. Or a biography. Not all books are worth rereading. Because, let\u2019s face it, not all books are worth reading once. You will hear people like Tony Robbins (American motivational speaker) say reading a book more than once is just a comfort thing, a security thing: you know it\u2019s going to be good, and that the best thing you can do is find a new book because that\u2019s a new challenge. I would argue Tony Robbins has never read Proust. Or dived into a book so good you never want to come out of it. And why not? Each of us takes away something different when we read. Whether you read purely because you believe it\u2019ll help you progress professionally, or you read for the pure fun enjoyment of a good story. Don\u2019t let others dictate how you should enjoy your reading time. Why you read is important As long as you remember reading is not a competition. If you don\u2019t enjoy reading\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re doing it wrong. If you think the number of books you read in a year is more important than what you read, and what you got out of reading\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re doing it wrong. The latter point is why so many don\u2019t want to reread. They feel the need to always be reading something new, something different, because otherwise how will they fit it all in? How, indeed. You will reread that book, because you will enjoy it: you\u2019ll learn something; and it will force you to slow down. There\u2019s no rush, all those other books aren\u2019t going anywhere. Thank you for reading.
