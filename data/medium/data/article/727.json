{"name": "727", "parent": "", "content": "Lyft Re-design Case\u00a0Study Image from\u00a0lyft.com I went to a Design Guru Summit workshop on May 17th. At the workshop, Frank Yoo, Lyft\u2019s head of UX and product design at Lyft, talked about the Lyft re-design. I learned useful design insights from his presentation and I wanted to share some takeaways with my design team at work. On May 26th, I met Vicki Tan, Lyft\u2019s product designer, at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk. She generously shared how their design team did A/B testing, and answered a few questions I had regarding their UX challenges. In order to better support my takeaways presentation, I did extra homework by researching more about the re-design online, and then creating a case study.

A photo of Lyft\u2019s design principles, taken at the\u00a0workshop Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of\u00a0Needs Lyft used this concept to define their design principles in a Pyramid shape. I was fascinated by how Lyft integrated psychology to define the principles order of importance. As a designer, I often run into situations where people have different ideas about design decisions; it can be tough to judge without any design principles. Therefore, with the encouragement from my colleague Klara Pelcl, I convinced our leadership to let me and Jules Cheung initiate and collaboratively set core design principles among our design team. We brainstormed together and created our own 6 principles: Know Your User, Clarity, Consistency, Efficiency, Collaboration and Beauty. By looking at Lyft\u2019s design principles graphic, it encouraged me to think about what we can do next to apply them in practice. Online Resource UX ChallengesI wanted to know what type of UX challenges Lyft faced while designing the app. I was glad to find some useful resource from Nectar Design, where Frank did a webinar about how Lyft handles UX challenges, and used the same pyramid method to tackle UX challenges. Here is a summary from Nectar Design: \u2022 Usability\u200a\u2014\u200aIt must solve a compelling user issue\u009a\u2022 Reliability\u200a\u2014\u200aEverything must work seamlessly and be as transparent as possible (Ex: ride times and costs)\u2022 Differentiate\u200a\u2014\u200aIt must be visually and interactively interesting (Ex: Lyft\u2019s glowing buttons and interactive options menu) Image from Nectar\u00a0Design Reasons for RedesignDuring the webinar, Frank talked about the reasons they re-designed the Lyft app, something I wish I could have asked him in person. Again thanks to Nectar Design I was able to find the reasons: \u2022 \u009aPoor representation of the driver that is requested\u2022 \u009aNo transparency about price or estimated time of arrival\u2022 Cars were not directional\u2022 \u009aPoor use of color\u2022 Options panel awkwardly placed\u009a\u2022 Request Lyft is vague for first time users Images from Nectar Design, I added title before and after to show comparison Success Analysis Now you probably want to know what results the Lyft re-design achieved. I might not be able to cover everything here but I\u2019ll share what I have so far. 1. Enhanced Transparency and SafetyAfter the system matches you with a driver, you can see all the important information you need\u200a\u2014\u200ayour driver\u2019s name and the color/model of his/her car. More importantly, displaying the driver\u2019s license plate number helps you quickly pick the right car so you know you\u2019re with the right driver. Image on the left is from pdxlyft, image on the right is a screenshot from my Lyft\u00a0app 2. Better Usage of Primary Color\u00a0From what I can see, Lyft uses hot pink as the primary color, and purple as the secondary. During the workshop Frank talked about the pink color and how they decided to limit the use of it, applying it only in important situations. My understanding is that they made the pink color an action item color, such as the logo, the \u201cRequest Lyft\u201d button, the destination pin and \u201cFree Rides\u201d on your profile menu. Screentshots from my Lyft\u00a0app 3. Price Estimate FeatureThe new UI includes a feature that allows users to get a ride\u2019s quote. By clicking on \u201cPrice estimate\u201d (see the image above), you have a good understanding of how much the ride is going to cost you. For example, a trip to Spicy King restaurant in Chinatown will cost me about $7-$11 from my pickup location. 4. Made It ErgonomicErgonomics make the user experience much better. The older app design had actions at both the top and bottom of the screen, which made it harder to use because your fingers had to cross the screen back and forth. What about the new design? I really like it myself as a user for the following reasons: \u2022 Tab MenuAll important menu actions are now at the bottom of the app, where you can select a type of ride you need (Carpool, Line, Regular Lyft, Plus and Premier), and you can set a pickup location right after. The UI for further actions in the request flow are also located in the same spot, resulting in a seamless experience. Image on the left is from pdxlyft, image on the right is a screenshot from my Lyft\u00a0app \u2022 Lyft CarsOn the map, the little Lyft cars were re-designed nicely, with a hint of pink and purple that shows color consistency across the app. Cars now turn directionally, which is a big help to people like me who don\u2019t have a great sense of direction with maps\u200a\u2014\u200aI can now easily figure out if the car I requested is heading towards my location or if the driver is going the opposite way (which also explains why sometime it takes longer than the estimated arrival time). Image on the left is from pdxlyft, image on the right is a screenshot from my Lyft\u00a0app \u2022 Options Before Car Arrival The new UI provides 4 options (Cancel, Split, Send ETA, Call driver) to users before their car arrives. I remember the hard time I had with the older UI, when I had to call my driver but couldn\u2019t find the button. Ease of use is much greater with all the options displayed up in front. Screenshot from my Lyft\u00a0app UX Research Lyft has different type of users\u200a\u2014\u200apassengers and drivers, how does UX research collaborate with design? As I mentioned in the beginning, Vicki Tan shared her insights during the panel at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk, where I learned quite a bit about their research. \u2022 Qualitative data vs. Quantitative data Image from Valient Market\u00a0Research Like many other companies, Lyft is metrics-driven and focuses on quantitative analysis (usually the numbers and graphs can be shared with the teams and the stakeholders in many formats, such as email, keynotes). However, quantitative data needs analysis to be useful. Because of that, qualitative data comes in handy and that\u2019s what they focus on more now. \u2022 Gather User Feedback Image from Medium post by\u00a0Violeta According to Vicki, Lyft invites real users (both passengers and drivers) to do regular weekly Q&A sessions in the office to ask them questions and listen to their feedback. By doing so, the design team learns if the users understand the features and what can be improved. I believe Lyft also uses other methods to collect qualitative data, so I did some research online and it looks like Lyft has been using \u201cLookback\u201d to aggregate a database of experiences where they can generate a montage of user feedback to better understand their needs. I tried \u201cLookback\u201d a few months ago, and found it very easy to record prototype testing on mobile. At my company, our design and UX research team have been using \u201cValidately\u201d to do both moderated and unmoderated testing. \u2022 A/B testing Image from\u00a0vwo.com During re-design progress, Lyft ran many A/B tests. As a result, Vicki found that the design they wanted was not the design the users wanted. At work, my design team faces this struggle all the time where we have different assumptions about what works for users the best. Without A/B testing, we are essentially designing features that suit our best interests, and might not be what the real users need. \u2022 Outcome\u00a0According to Nectar Design, Lyft has conducted hundreds of hours of user testing and validates their assumptions along the way. This is good because it builds confidence in the team, stakeholders, and customers.
