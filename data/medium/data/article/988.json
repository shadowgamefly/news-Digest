{"name": "988", "parent": "", "content": "I ate a\u00a0banana It is true. Yesterday on our family\u2019s return trip from Kansas City, I ate a banana. If you know me, it\u2019s kind of a big deal. I\u2019d prefer a Nutty Bar. It got me thinking\u200a\u2014 as our girls watched McFarland, USA in the back of the van\u200a\u2014 about resolutions. More specifically, about how I could get better in 2016. Too often, I have been a \u2018fly by the seat of my pants\u2019 kind of guy. Most of the time, it\u2019s gotten me in trouble. Not that life was awful, but it could have been better. Last year, my wife had me write down some goals on the notes section of my phone. I looked back on them a few times and didn\u2019t do terrible. In fact, I\u2019d say 2015 was a pretty productive year. So, I joined Medium to journal my thoughts for a year\u200a\u2014 to resolve to journal 300 days in 2016\u200a\u2014 and to share my story and the stories I write with you. Some days may be 1,000 words; some days 30. It\u2019s is, simply, my first resolution. The five rules of resolutions: specific, measurable, must be your goals, must have a time limit, must be in writing. Thanks for reading. Leave a comment for give a recommend if you think it\u2019s worth it. I look forward to sharing my story in 2016.
