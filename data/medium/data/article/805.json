{"name": "805", "parent": "", "content": "The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a SaaS Startup from Scratch\u200a\u2014\u200aBy Yourself (Part\u00a01) Welcome to no man\u2019s\u00a0land. No co-founders. No funding. No connections. No customers. No\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re not nuts. But First, a Digression\u2026 Are you like me and completely sick of all the patronizing startup advice out there? You know, the kind that goes like this: \u201cJust collect emails! I make $50K MRR and only launched to 100,000 email signups!\u201d \u201cJust build an audience! I sold $2M of info products to mine!\u201d \u201cJust do integration marketing! I get 250K signups a week from my Mechanical Turk integration!\u201d \u201cJust make your product epic! We\u2019ve never spent a dime on advertising and never did any marketing!\u201d Let me give you permission to join me in calling bullshit. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. And anyone that would lead you to believe otherwise is only trying to make themselves seem smarter and more clever than you\u200a\u2014\u200aso that you\u2019ll keep listening to them for their next nugget of advice. The stone cold truth of the matter is that most of the people pandering this advice are only doing so to build up their \u201cguru\u201d status. When they claim they got 100,000 email signups in a week (and make it look as easy as microwaving popcorn)\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re playing you. They\u2019re creating an idealized result that you will never attain. At the same time, they\u2019re implying that you should be able to get similar results\u200a\u2014\u200abut only if you know what they know. They do this so that look up to them. They do this so that you talk about them (getting you to help them grow their audience). They do this so that you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re somehow less than they are. And they do this to make you feel like you can only be successful with their continued \u201chelp\u201d (or exclusive online webinar with limited seats starting at $1,000 where they spill all their \u201csecrets\u201d). I promise I\u2019m not going to do any of that to you. What follows is straightforward, battle tested, and pragmatic advice to help you get your SaaS startup off the ground all by your lonesome\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like I did when bootstrapping Tamboo (a service that lets you record and watch what people do on your website), as well as a handful of other SaaS apps. Some of it may seem simple. Don\u2019t be fooled. There is complexity in simple things. The more you experience it, the more you\u2019ll see what I mean by that. Let\u2019s get to it. A Quick Update All thriller no filler startup warfare at its\u00a0finest! Since its original publication, The Epic Guide has become an *insanely* popular resource for bootstrapped startups\u200a\u2014\u200aon the verge of becoming a \u201ccult classic\u201d! I\u2019ve had an insane number of people asking me for even more down and to the point advice for building their startups\u200a\u2014\u200aso much so that it\u2019s inspired me to give The Epic Guide the full-length book treatment. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the book or if you\u2019re itching to pick up a copy, head on over to this page I\u2019ve set up for The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a Startup By Yourself: The Book! Now back to our regularly scheduled programming: If You Love Writing Code, You\u2019re Going to Hate Running a SaaS Business Spoiler Alert: This is NOT how you are going to spend your\u00a0days. Since most people wanting to start a SaaS business are developers, we need to get this out of the way\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast. Building and running a SaaS business has nothing to do with your ability to write code. Too many developers have the following thought process: Wow, I\u2019m pretty good at writing code, and I get paid pretty well doing that for this company. I should totally use my skills for myself instead of these jokers and build an app that I can sell over and over again to everyone. Just like that one guy I read about who made a gazillion dollars from his side project! His app\u2019s UI looked like something from 2005\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m waaaayyyyy better than that loser. When people see how awesome the apps I build are, they\u2019ll be throwing money my way! I\u2019ll get to spend all of my time writing code that I could finally be proud of. I\u2019ll get to code things the right way\u200a\u2014\u200anot the jank ass way these ass clowns do things. I\u2019ll have a build server for continuous integration and have automated unit tests for everything and I\u2019ll use that cool new framework I just saw the other day on HackerNews and\u00a0\u2026 Yeah, that would be great. Except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Unless you relish doing failed startup postmortems. This might be going a little too far, but at the same time it\u2019s probably not going far enough: Code is the least important thing about a SaaS business. In fact, most startup codebases are dismal abysses of darkness, pain, and the cause for much wailing and gnashing of teeth. They are the furthest thing from the pristine green fields you imagine them to be. The reason for this is simple: A business\u2019s software serves one purpose and one purpose only: To make the business money. You want comprehensive unit tests for your entire codebase? How does that make the business money? You want to use DI and IoC? How does that make the business money? You want to use that shiny new framework? How does that make the business money? Contrast that with the following: This customer is requesting this feature. How fast can we build that so we can get them to buy? We think making this change will get more signups. How fast can we make that happen? This thing is completely broken right now and we have customers cancelling! How fast can we get a fix in? If you try to build your SaaS app like you build enterprise software, you will most likely fail. Not because your software isn\u2019t good enough (in fact, I\u2019ll bet you it would be downright awesome). But because you took too long working on things that don\u2019t contribute to the business making money. And so you just simply run out of time and/or money. Game over. Now don\u2019t misread me here. We\u2019re talking about code, not your product. Your product still has to be good. It still needs to be solid. It still needs to do what your customers expect it to do. Customers care about your product. You\u2019re the only one who cares about your code. The other thing you need to be aware of is that you\u2019re going to spend very little time actually writing code running a SaaS business. How little? There\u2019s times that I don\u2019t write a line of code for months on end. Instead of coding, the vast majority of your time is going to be spent marketing, selling, optimizing funnels, and providing support. Those are the things that get (and keep) customers. Those are the things that you do when you run a business. Not writing code. Getting Your Idea Off The Ground Are you ready for\u00a0takeoff? Now that we\u2019ve gotten all of that out of the way, let\u2019s get to the good stuff: How to actually build a SaaS business from nothing. First off, you should know that your idea probably sucks. Dude, what\u2019s with all of this negativity? Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you that I don\u2019t kid glove when it comes to this stuff. If you want to feel good about yourself, go listen to one of the startup gurus out there that will be more than happy to spoon feed you some entreporn. We\u2019re busy building a business here. Now, back to your idea. The reason your idea probably sucks is because it\u2019s your idea. Meaning: Your idea is only worth something if other people care about it. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think. Chances are you\u2019re not Elon Musk (hello if you are!). We\u2019re building a business, not our ego. So really, your SaaS business idea is just a guess. You\u2019re guessing that this is something that people are interested in. You\u2019re guessing that this is something people would want to use. You\u2019re guessing that this is something that people will give you money for. You\u2019re guessing that this is something that can scale into an actual business that can replace your income. So Elon\u200a\u2014\u200agoing forward, we\u2019re not going to refer to your precious game-changing idea as \u201cyour idea\u201d anymore. We\u2019re going to refer to it as \u201cyour guess\u201d. This will help you disassociate your emotions from the process. And believe me, you\u2019re going to need to do just that. Finding the Right Words Blank pages are\u00a0scary. If you\u2019ve heard about value propositions, USPs, elevator pitches, etc. and think you can just skip this section\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re doing so at your own peril. Getting your messaging right is perhaps one of the most important things you need to nail. Pretty much everything down stream depends on this. And don\u2019t think you\u2019ll just do this once and be done. You\u2019ll probably get it wrong the first few times. Plus you\u2019ll need to continually come back to this as you try to grow your market. Now that we have our hunch or guess (not idea!), we need to answer three important questions: We need to do this for two reasons. First, we need to sanity check our guess to make sure that it\u2019s actually valuable to people and that we\u2019re thinking in terms of what it enables people to do. Your guess shouldn\u2019t be about software. Your guess should be about the types of superpowers or beneficial outcomes people will get as a result of using your service. Second, we need a way to quickly explain our guess to people to see how they react to it. It\u2019s simple (but infuriatingly difficult). Let\u2019s play fill in the blank: I believe that people want to <ability> so that they can <outcome>, and they would pay good money for that because <value>. For example: I believe that people want to send automated drip email campaigns to their email list signups so that they can automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers, and they would pay good money for that because trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever. Perfect. This becomes our business hypothesis. Now we need to rearrange the jigsaw pieces a little bit for when we put the message in front of people. One more time: If you <value>, you can <ability> with <Your Business Name> so that you can <outcome>. If you have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it\u2019s hard and takes forever, you can send automated drip email campaigns to your email list signups with MailZoo so that you can automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers. Awesome. Now\u200a\u2014\u200aare your messages compelling? You did do this, right? Need more prodding? When I first started out building online businesses, I didn\u2019t do this exercise and would just jump in and start coding. Most of those projects would wind up failing miserably. When I started doing this exercise (and got it right), my projects stopped failing. Now. Are your business hypothesis and customer-facing message believable? Do you really think people would give you good money for the ability you\u2019re giving them? Is the outcome you came up with plausible and something that people actually want to achieve? If not, go back to the drawing board until it sings. This can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months to get right. And if you can never get it right, chances are your guess was wrong and you\u2019ll need to come up with a new one. There are no sacred cows when it comes to building a business. I don\u2019t care how much you love your \u201cidea\u201d. If it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cbuy me!\u201d when you put it into this format, slaughter it and start over with something new. Let\u2019s Make Some Friends Oh yeah. I forgot to mention\u200a\u2014\u200ayou actually need to talk to\u00a0people. Now, let\u2019s take the underlying reason that people would pay money for our service from the exercise above. Just for reference, our example is that people would be willing to pay good money for our solution because converting leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever. Our job now is to find people that meet this criteria. In our example, we\u2019re looking for people that have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it\u2019s hard and takes forever. (See why I told you that was important?) We need to test some very important things here that will make or break our business: So now it\u2019s time to hurt our heads a little bit. Go and brainstorm 20 different and specific places you can find the kinds of people that would want to give you money for the value statement you\u2019re offering. These need to be super specific. You can\u2019t say something like \u201cpeople who participate in online forums where they talk about email marketing\u201d. No. You need to name those forums. And they can only count as one way out of the 20 we\u2019re talking about here. You\u2019ll ultimately need to figure this out for yourself, but here\u2019s some ideas based on our ongoing example: People following MailChimp on Twitter, people who hang out on inbound.org, people that have blogs with a newsletter signup box, people listening to the Smart Passive Income podcast, people who have retweeted any of Ramit Sethi\u2019s articles, people who like HubSpot on Facebook, etc. You\u2019ll probably find that this is harder than it seems. That\u2019s okay. It is. As a side note: If you can\u2019t come up with 20 good places, chance are you don\u2019t know who your customer actually is. Believe me, it\u2019s better you find this out now rather than after you\u2019ve spent 5\u20136 months heads down around the clock coding your app. Either educate yourself or pick a customer you understand better. Alright, it\u2019s about time we put ourselves out there. Like I said before, all you have right now is a guess\u200a\u2014\u200anot an idea. You\u2019re guessing that some solution you\u2019ve concocted in your head is actually going to be useful to people. So we\u2019re going to find out if people care about what you have to say. But here\u2019s the kicker\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re not going to tell them anything about our solution. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Instead, we\u2019re going to see if they care about the reason we think they\u2019d want to give us money. You\u2019ll see why in a few. So now, we\u2019re going to research 10 individual people from each of the 20 places we identified. Yes. If you\u2019re good at math, you just realized that we\u2019re going to be going after 200 people. I kid you not. You\u2019ll also see why in a few. Let\u2019s take our running example. Let\u2019s say we think that people that have blogs with a newsletter signup box would care about what we\u2019re talking about. Great. Let\u2019s go find 10 blogs that we think would give us money based on the premise that we identified. Find out how you can get in touch with the person running the blog. Ideally, you want an email address. You can settle for a contact form. But don\u2019t just leave some comment spam and walk away thinking you did your job. Now, let\u2019s send them a personalized message like the following: \u201cHey <Name>! I was just reading your post about <what the post\u2019s about>. I totally agree with you that <some point they made>. In fact, <your own thoughts on that point>. I also noticed that you have a newsletter. I was curious what kinds of things you send to your list, if you have products you are trying to sell to your list, and if you\u2019re doing it all by hand or using something like MailChimp for that? The reason I ask is I\u2019m thinking of doing something with newsletters myself and I\u2019m not too sure what people like you are doing with theirs. Anything you could share with me would be huge. Thanks and keep up the awesome work you\u2019re doing!\u201d The text in bold is just my emphasis to call out where we\u2019re slipping in the part we think they would care enough about to pay money for\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t bold your own text like that. Also: Never say you like something if you don\u2019t, express interest in something you could care less about, or mislead them in any way. It will come back to bite you. Tenfold. If you do everything right, you should probably get a handful of responses from the 200 people you sent detailed, thoughtful, well researched messages to. Yep, you read that right. A handful of responses for 200 messages. If you work in a corporate environment, this will probably mess with you. Think about it. You\u2019re used responding to emails you receive, and you\u2019re used to getting responses from people you\u2019ve sent emails to. It\u2019s common office courtesy. If you don\u2019t respond to an email, you\u2019re ostrisized. The internet doesn\u2019t work that way. Indifference is the rule. We\u2019ll talk more about how to handle rejection later on. Because of this, you may be tempted to just blast people with a template. Don\u2019t. People will see right through it. Plus that\u2019s just spammy and wrong. Okay, so let\u2019s say we get some responses. You\u2019d honestly be surprised by how much information you can get from people when you just ask them about what they\u2019re doing. Maybe they read like this: \u201cThanks so much! That was a tough post for me to write because <some reason you never would have guessed>. Yeah, I use my newsletter to try and get people to purchase my $29 e-book on <some topic that\u2019s related to their blog>. It can be hard to keep up with, and I don\u2019t always get the response I want. I tried to do it by hand, but my list got too big so I moved it to MailChimp. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not great either. Hope that helps. Good luck!\u201d I had a dog and BINGO was his name-o. If you don\u2019t get any responses, or if you don\u2019t get any responses that reinforce your hypothesis, you have a couple of options: For those of you still playing along at home, we\u2019re not done\u200a\u2014\u200anowhere near close. But if you are getting responses like this, you\u2019ve gotten some confirmation that the underlying reason people would give you money does exist. Now it\u2019s time to find out if they think your solution is worth any salt. Time To See If Our Solution Sticks Now it\u2019s time to see what happens when we actually put our idea out in front of those people who responded in a way that confirms our money-generating hypothesis. Something as simple as this would suffice (bold is my own\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t bold your stuff): Thanks for getting back to me! I\u2019ve actually been asking some other bloggers about their newsletters too and they\u2019re basically echoing what you\u2019re saying\u200a\u2014\u200athat it\u2019s a little rough to do everything by hand or with MailChimp and that they\u2019re not getting the results they want. Out of curiosity, if there were something that would let you send automated drip email campaigns to your email list signups so that you could automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers, would that be something you\u2019d be interested in? I only ask because after hearing everyone talking about this, I\u2019m thinking there could be a good opportunity to do something different here. Plus I\u2019m a developer, and I think that could be a fun project to work on\u00a0:) You can see that here, we use the ability and outcome from our earlier messaging exercise. (See why I told you to do that?) Now, one of the following is going to probably happen: Chances are, you\u2019re going to get responses #1\u20133 far more often than #4. So what do you do? If you don\u2019t get a response, you should follow up until you do or they tell you to bugger off. If their response is \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a problem\u201d, ask them under what circumstances it would become a problem or make sense for them to try what you\u2019re offering. If you get enough of these types of responses, it may be that you\u2019re close, and that you just need to target people that have the problem they refer to or are in the circumstances they describe. If their response is \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of companies already doing that\u201d, don\u2019t scrap your idea! Just because someone else is already doing what you thought was a revolutionary concept doesn\u2019t mean you should give up. In fact, it helps to prove that there might already be a market out there for you. In this case, you should ask them what they mean by \u201cexpensive\u201d and what they would like to see in the market as an alternative to the companies they mentioned. See if adjusting your offering in light of these insights will get you to \u201cHeck yes\u201d. If they\u2019ve said \u201cHeck yes\u201d, you\u2019re nailing it. After you get those \u201cHeck yeses\u201d, tell them that you\u2019re going to look into what you can do for them and ask them if they\u2019d be interested to look at what you come up with. 20x that bad\u00a0boy. The goal here is to get to 20 \u201cHeck yeses\u201d that are interested in hearing about what you come up with. You\u2019ll need to refine your message, listen to feedback, adjust your message again, try different approaches, different places, different people, etc. Make no mistake, it\u2019ll most likely suck. If you can\u2019t get to 20, you might want to reconsider what you\u2019re doing. Next Up: Hand-to-Hand Combat SaaS is a contact\u00a0sport.
