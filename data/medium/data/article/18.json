{"content": "10 books that will make you a better writer (and\u00a0why) Books every fiction writer should\u00a0own Last week, I wrote about 25 habits that will make you a better writer. This week, I thought\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s dive into books. After twenty-plus years writing, I\u2019ve collected some resources that I absolutely couldn\u2019t do with out. 25 Habits That Will Make You a WriterHard learned lessons distilled from 25 years of writingmedium.com I love borrowing books. But there are some books that a writer really should have in their own personal for-keeps libraries. These are the books that you\u2019ll keep coming back to, over and over, through your career. Here are my top ten writing craft books. Some of them I\u2019ve owned for twenty years or more. Some are new to me. Some are classics that you might already own. Maybe there are some that will be new to you. Self-Editing for Fiction Writers by Renni Browne and Dave\u00a0King http://amzn.to/2oPzo9X \u201cYou want to draw your readers into the world you\u2019ve created, make them feel a part of it, make them forget where they are. And you can\u2019t do this effectively if you tell your readers about your world secondhand.\u201d In 2004, when I was eight months pregnant, I won Nanowrimo for the first time. I wrote a truly awful first draft of a romantic suspense story. Then I had a baby girl on December 8. I never looked back. Once I knew that I could finish writing a novel, I knew that I could learn how to write well. Self-Editing for Fiction Writers is the book that taught me how to be a better writer. I finished my first manuscript and took a solid year, going through this book, chapter by chapter, exercise by exercise, and applying what I learned to my work. Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray\u00a0Bradbury http://amzn.to/2nvgBR0 \u201cI have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space travel, sideshows or gorillas. When this occurs, I pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room.\u201d Ray Bradbury\u2019s little book of essays about writing and creativity is an essential little pocket of inspiration. I\u2019ve read it half a dozen times and every single time, I pick up something new. Because it\u2019s a collection of essays, you can pick it up and read what you need, when you need it. Bradbury\u2019s advice for fiction writers has shaped my writing life. He believed, especially, in short stories and in reading a lot. And watching movies. One of my favorite parts of Zen in the Art of Writing is the way that Bradbury breaks down how and why he wrote some of my favorite short stories. On Writing by Stephen\u00a0King http://amzn.to/2nYruaf \u201cWriting isn\u2019t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it\u2019s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It\u2019s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy.\u201d In 1997, I sent a query letter to Dog Fancy magazine, pitching an idea for an article about dog-friendly restaurants in Las Vegas. They accepted. I wrote the article, my sister Alison took a couple of pictures of her dog at a dog-friendly restaurant in Las Vegas, and Dog Fancy magazine paid me $10. In 1997, gas cost about a dollar a gallon. I put my $10 in my ginormous yellow station wagon. And because Stephen King wrote, in On Writing, that he considers anyone who writes something that someone pays them for, and they use that money to pay the bills, a successful writer, when my daughter Adrienne started Kindergarten a few weeks later, I wrote \u2018writer\u2019 in the space for her mother\u2019s occupation. You\u2019d have to look hard to find a list of books for writers that doesn\u2019t include this one. That\u2019s not because the people who make the lists are lazy or unimaginative. It\u2019s because it\u2019s that good. If you only buy one, buy this one. Write. Publish. Repeat. by Sean Platt and Johnny B.\u00a0Truant http://amzn.to/2nvcfZU \u201cThe people who read pirated books are never going to buy your work anyway; it\u2019s a totally different audience than purchasing readers. Even if you could scrub your stuff from the Internet, you\u2019d only be keeping your book from pirate readers. You wouldn\u2019t convert those readers into buyers. They\u2019d simply read something else that was free.\u201d My friend Hartley talks all the time about the \u201cWrite, publish, repeat guys.\u201d When I finally picked up this book to read, I totally got why. Sean Platt, Johnny B. Truant, and David Wright are genius at figuring out how to meld art and business without losing what\u2019s important about either one. Seriously, they\u2019ve made an art of the business of writing and it\u2019s incredible. If you don\u2019t listen to their Self-publishing Podcast, you should. And definitely, read this book. Whether your plan is traditional publishing or going indie, it\u2019s important to learn the business of being an author. There aren\u2019t a whole lot of people talking about that. I don\u2019t think anyone is talking about it quite this well. Indie Writer Survival Guide by Susan Kaye\u00a0Quinn http://amzn.to/2pivrqn \u201cAdmit it, name it, and take action in the face of it.\u201d Another friend, Tracy Clark, introduced me to Indie Author Survival Guide by Susan Kaye Quinn. It\u2019s not quite as slick as Write. Publish. Repeat. but it\u2019s full of fantastic information. It\u2019s like sitting down with a friend whose several steps ahead of you in this thing, and having her tell you all of her secrets. Quinn is a solid mid-list indie author and she talks a lot in the book about how she got there. I love that she talks about things that feel possible, for any writer. Lots of the time, when you read about someone\u2019s success, they\u2019ve done something or had something happen to them that just isn\u2019t reproducible by the average writer. One more time: if you want to be a novelist, you need to know how to sell books, regardless of the mode with which you publish your work. You can take that from me. I wrote about my experience with Penguin here: How Being Published by the Big Six F*cked Me Up.All my life, I\u2019ve had one dream.medium.com Story Genius by Lisa\u00a0Cron http://amzn.to/2pivMJR \u201cEach thing you add to your story is a drop of paint falling into clear water; it spreads through and colors everything.\u201d You know how sometimes you read a book and it just instantly feels like it\u2019s yours? That\u2019s how Story Genius was for me. Lisa Cron\u2019s book is all about how our brains react to stories. It was assigned to me by my MFA mentor and I\u2019m so glad. I especially love the exercises in this one. They help me to take a deeper dive into my characters, into my story, and into the reasons why I\u2019m writing it. This book is definitely one you\u2019ll want to own, because you\u2019ll be coming back to it again and again as you write. Steering the Craft by Ursula K.\u00a0LeGuin http://amzn.to/2piHy6F \u201cUltimately you write alone. And ultimately you and you alone can judge your work. The judgment that a work is complete\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what I meant to do, and I stand by it\u200a\u2014\u200acan come only from the writer, and it can be made rightly only by a writer who\u2019s learned to read her own work. Group criticism is great training for self-criticism. But until quite recently no writer had that training, and yet they learned what they needed. They learned it by doing it.\u201d According to the intro to this book, Steering the Craft started as a course Ursula K. Le Guin gave to aspiring writers. I can\u2019t tell you how badly I wish I\u2019d been able to take that class! She teaches writers not only how to write, but how to make the story become a living thing for the reader. Beautiful. The Writer\u2019s Journey by Christopher Vogler http://amzn.to/2oU43T0 \u201cI realized that the good stories were affecting the organs of my body in various ways, and the really good ones were stimulating more than one organ. An effective story grabs your gut, tightens your throat, makes your heart race and your lungs pump, brings tears to your eyes or an explosion of laughter to your lips.\u201d Of all of the books on this list, The Writer\u2019s Journey might be my favorite. It\u2019s taught me more about story structure than any other resource, including my undergraduate and graduate work in creative writing. It\u2019s a step-by-step guide through the classic hero\u2019s journey with examples and exercises that will improve your writing if you pay attention. My free course The Plotting Workshop is based on The Writer\u2019s Journey. The Creative Tarot by Jessica\u00a0Crispin \u201cDo you know that maxim \u2018Write what you know?\u2019 Nonsense. That saying lets us off the hook for our more narcissistic impulses and for not trying to understand the world around us.\u201d This one\u2019s just pure fun. I\u2019ve been having so much fun with The Creative Tarot and my set of Rider Tarot Deck. It gets my creative juices flowing. Especially if I\u2019m feeling a little stuck. I found out about it through Austin Kleon\u2019s newsletter, so that\u2019s a nice segway into\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Steal Like an Artist by Austin\u00a0Kleon http://amzn.to/2nYFYqm \u201cDraw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use\u200a\u2014\u200ado the work you want to see done.\u201d What I love the most about Austin Kleon\u2019s work is the way it is just pure creativity. Every time I read his newsletter or pick up one of his books, it\u2019s like a booster shot of creative inspiration. Own Steal Like an Artist. It\u2019s only $5.99 on Amazon right now. Seriously\u200a\u2014\u200abest $6 spent ever. (If you really want to go all in, buy Show Your Work, too. Also $5.99!) And, whatever else you do after reading this entire post, go sign up for Kleon\u2019s newsletter. It\u2019s one of my favorite pieces of email all week.
