{"name": "932", "parent": "", "content": "Why Where You Live Can Make You Wealthier, Healthier, And\u00a0Happier By Richard\u00a0Reis Hello dear, I just got back from my daily walk. Of course, it\u2019s a gorgeous, sunny, and warm, California day. Perfect timing too, since walking fits nicely into the theme of this letter. You know, our past two letters have been pretty heavy. Talking about taxes and retirement plans ain\u2019t easy. This is why I\u2019m so happy we are going lighter today! (but it\u2019s just as important, so pay attention) Location\u200a\u2014\u200aaka where you\u00a0live Picking the right address is so important, it can make or break your bank! Yet, I think most people haven\u2019t put much thought into it (as evidenced by the strange phenomenon known as \u201crush hour\u201d). Jacob at Early Retirement Extreme put it perfectly; the three most important things that matter for where you live are: Notice, in none of these reasons did he include \u201cthe place must be nice\u201d. In other words, if you live further away from work just to live in a \u201cnicer\u201d apartment or house, you\u2019re hurting yourself (of course, this excludes moving to a bad/ unsafe neighborhood). \u201cChoosing a Place to Live is not about kitchen countertop surfaces or closet arrangements. It\u2019s about putting you in the center of where you want your life to be. You can always decorate and optimize, but you cannot teleport. So location is everything, even if it means downsizing or renting instead of buying. Living in the right place gives you back time, energy, and friends.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMr. Money\u00a0Mustache So, there you have it. In simple words; live close to where you live. That means your work and grocery outlet should be walking distance from where you live! \u201cI\u2019m still not convinced,\u201d you say? \u201cThe places closer to my job are more expensive.\u201d That might be true. It\u2019s something I hear a lot. But rarely has that person done the math. So, before making the same conclusion, let\u2019s test your assumption. Did you calculate the true cost of commuting? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American commute is 26 minutes. If you own your car, you\u2019re paying roughly $0.34 per minute driven. You commute twice so it\u2019s 52 minutes per day. Multiply that by the cost per minute and you\u2019re spending roughly $17 per day on your commutes. 2016 had 261 working days. Which means the average person with a 26min commute spent $4,437 in 2016 just to drive back and forth from work! (if your commute is longer, I have some bad, bad news). Remember you said living closer to work is more expensive? How about this; with $4,437 on commutes you could instead live in a place that\u2019s walking distance from work, costs $350 more per month than your current location, and you\u2019d STILL have more money by the end of the year! That\u2019s without mentioning the hours. 52min per day means 260min per week. That\u2019s half a workday! You\u2019re giving away an extra HALF a workday every week just to sit in your car. Are you angry yet? How about the 17% of Americans who have commutes that are 45 minutes or longer? Yeah, \u201cwow.\u201d Ok, I\u2019m done blowing your mind. Take a deep breath. It\u2019s over. Let\u2019s look at solutions. But I live in San Francisco So, you decided to live in an expensive city like San Francisco or New York. Firstly, that\u2019s not such a bad thing because it gives you access to some of the world\u2019s biggest money-making machines. In 2015, the median US household income was around $55,000 but in San Francisco, it was $88,000. Secondly, it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re in the right industry. It makes sense to live in SF if you work in tech, NY if you work in finance or fashion, or LA if you work in movies. Don\u2019t forget, the best thing is for you to live where there\u2019s an abundance of opportunities. Therefore, in some cases the high price is justifiable. Note: To find your dream city, here\u2019s a great website. However, before moving to any city I recommend you check out Trulia and their \u201caffordability heat map\u201d to find the cheapest area to live. SF affordability heat map. Stay away from red! Stay away from\u00a0red!! The real value of your\u00a0location What neighborhood you live in doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cOk, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d you say. \u201cOf course it matters! Neighborhood x is better than neighborhood y, that\u2019s where I want to be!\u201d You know what matters more than neighborhood x, y, or z? Community. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Ferraris are parked in each driveway. If you feel lonely where you live, you\u2019ll be miserable. In fact, Eric Weiner put it perfectly in his book, \u201cThe Geography of Bliss: One Grump\u2019s Search for the Happiest Place on Earth\u201d: \u201cThe self-help industrial complex hasn\u2019t helped. By telling us that happiness lives inside us, it\u2019s turned us inward just when we should be looking outward. Not to money but to other people, to community and to the kind of human bonds that so clearly are the sources of our happiness. Americans work longer hours and commute greater distances than virtually any other people in the world. Commuting, in particular, has been found to be detrimental to our happiness, as well as our physical health. Every minute spent on the road is one less minute that we can spend with family and friends\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of activities, in other words, that make us\u00a0happy. Political scientist Robert Putnam makes a convincing case in his book Bowling Alone that our sense of connection is fraying. We spend less time visiting family and friends; we belong to fewer community groups. Increasingly, we lead fragmented lives. The Internet and other technologies may salve our loneliness, but they have not, I believe, eliminated it.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEric\u00a0Weiner No matter where you live, feeling connected or lonely will determine whether or not you love or hate it (this is why I moved right across the street from my friend who I build apps with). Humans are meant to live in small communities (and if more people did it, less of us would be depressed!). \u201cBut I\u2019m shy,\u201d you say. I understand. So am I. Which is why you should check out NextDoor. It\u2019s the best way to indirectly meet your neighbors. Just browsing through I can see I\u2019ve been invited to some \u201cInternational Party & Lunch to celebrate Canada\u201d next week. I can also see one of my neighbors is giving away a free chair while another is giving away a lawnmower. Now that\u2019s how you build community! Bonus I know, I know. After reading everything I talked about, you rushed to Zillow and started looking for places closer to work. You\u2019re smart. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but I have another reason (besides more money and happiness) why turning your car commute into a walking commute is the best decision you\u2019ll make. That reason is health. Would you like to know: It\u2019s this: WALKING. Don\u2019t believe me? Watch this video. Not only is this the best habit you can pick up for your health, you\u2019ll also be in good company. In his book \u201cThe Geography of Genius: A Search for the World\u2019s Most Creative Places from Ancient Athens to Silicon Valley\u201d, Eric Weiner investigates what geniuses through the ages (the ancient Greek philosophers, the Renaissance artists, the Silicon Valley geniuses) have in common. You can guess one of their habits, right? That\u2019s it! They walked, a lot. \u201c\u2018The ancient Greeks walked everywhere, all the time.\u2019 They were great walkers and great thinkers and preferred to do their philosophizing while on the\u00a0go. The Greeks, as usual, knew what they were doing. Many a genius has done his or her best thinking while walking. While working on A Christmas Carol, Dickens would walk fifteen or twenty miles through the back streets of London, turning over the plot in his mind, as the city slept. Mark Twain walked a lot, too, though he never got anywhere. He paced while he worked\u00a0[\u2026] Recently, researchers have begun to investigate scientifically the link between walking and creativity. [\u2026] The results, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, confirm that the ancient Greeks were onto something. Creativity levels were \u201cconsistently and significantly\u201d higher for the walkers versus the sitters. [\u2026] It didn\u2019t take a lot of walking to boost creativity, either\u200a\u2014\u200aanywhere from five to sixteen minutes.\u2019\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEric\u00a0Weiner If Plato, Einstein, and Steve Jobs walked every day, maybe there\u2019s something to it? Studies have shown that walking 30min a day is the ideal dose for all the goodies (that sounds like a perfect daily commute). And that\u2019s it for today! Hopefully, after reading this you will: See you next week, be well. R P.S.: After sharing this post with a friend, here\u2019s her reply (I don\u2019t have kids, so the thought didn\u2019t even cross my mind. But if you do, living close to their school is very important. Otherwise, you get a double commute! Who wants that??) Is this helpful?
