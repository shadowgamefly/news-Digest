But, hey, stay for the cute baby polar bears. They\u2019re here for a limited time only. #globalwarmingscience) News of the election results finally made it to the Arctic. This baby polar bear doesn\u2019t know WHAT to think! (photo from weloveallanimals.com) Fellow liberal-type folks, just be aware. This article is not about what you might think and it may push some buttons. Honestly, if you had told me three days ago that I\u2019d be writing it, I\u2019d have suggested you have your medication changed. I just hope that I can write this with clarity and simplicity (Read: short and sweet) because it\u2019s almost 5 a.m. I have not been able to sleep. Again. And during all that awake time, I thought about some stuff. I did some reading. I reminisced. I hadn\u2019t thought about Corlotta in a month or so, but for some reason she was on my mind big time last night. Most prominent in my memory was the day she drove me to look at the spot where I\u2019d totaled my car a few days earlier in a DUI. It was October 10, 2010. That\u2019s my sobriety date: 10.10.10.\u00a0That was coincidental, but kind of cool. Anyhow, we parked her car and walked over to where I\u2019d wrecked. I had crossed the center line and crashed into the trees that had been planted on the sidewalk as barriers between traffic and Toys-r-Us. Thank God. Interspersed among the trees were metal poles that were about the same color and circumference as the little trees. The poles were made of much sturdier stuff. There was a pole about two inches to the right of the tree that had absorbed my impact. If I\u2019d hit THAT, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here mid-insomnia writing to you about it. Corlotta looked at me and said, \u201cOur lives are built upon seconds and inches. A few of one or the other either way, and we\u2019re standing in a homeless camp, or jail, or worse. Of course, it can go the other way, too. But I don\u2019t think that happens as easily.\u201d She was right, of course. She\u2019s ALWAYS right. I think of those words all the time: When I\u2019m scared, or angry, or afraid to make a decision. Or when I realize I\u2019ve gone the whole day without being grateful just to be breathing. When something bad happens to someone I personally care about, or when it happens to someone I don\u2019t even know. When it finally \u2018clicks\u2019 for me that I am presenting myself as someone firmly grounded in solution even though pieces of me are definitely part of the problem. That last part is where I found myself last night. BUT FIRST, Time for a Commercial Break SPONSORED BY: More Polar Bears. Because there can never be too much cuteness. Moms? Note the look on the Mama Bear\u2019s face. She can\u2019t even with these three. (Polar bears rarely have multiples. She just got lucky.) I only have two, but I promise you I had that look on my face last night, for hours. Mama Polar Bear? I UNDERSTAND YOU.

No credit; Page is inactive\u2026 SO, I want to talk today about the things that money can\u2019t buy. Because I\u2019m horrified, just like many of you. And I\u2019m afraid for the future; for my kids. So, I understand that horror,and that fear, and also the sense of betrayal and bewilderment you might be experiencing. And it\u2019s okay to feel all of that. And it\u2019s okay to assemble; to march in the streets in protest; to defend your position, and tell your side. I sure have been. But, when I told it I was forgetting something important. I forgot to listen to the other\u00a0side. I\u2019ve gotten so used to thinking of Drumpf supporters as something to be pitied for their minimal intelligence, or their lack of understanding of what electing Drumpf will mean, and all sorts of other negative things. But I realized today that \u201cDrumpf Supporters\u201d make up far more of the population than I originally guessed. I kept reading comments, and I saw that people were really mad, obviously. But I was saddened that instead of a dialogue about the pros and cons, the comments added up to one giant hate-fest. And we just don\u2019t have that luxury anymore. One thing I heard from Drumpf voters more than anything else was complaining about how the Liberals are being kept by the media, in their own little bubble and hearing what the media wants them to hear, as often as they can. And I can sort of see that. Because, for years, I\u2019ve said the same thing about Conservatives. And the more I read, the more similar the two parties became. I\u2019ve been trying to listen even though I am triggered by anger and hatred, and the people who I personally know that voted for Drumpf DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. They don\u2019t want to grab women by the pussy, or get rid of marriage equality, or force a woman to bring a baby to term against her will. Those people are out there, like they always have been. But if my community is any kind of a decent random sampling (probably not), people voted for Drumpf because to them, Hillary was the more frightening choice. They struggled, and they followed their conscience. How can I condemn them for that? It\u2019s EXACTLY why I voted for Hillary. And she\u2019s certainly not without blemishes of her own. They\u2019re not Drumpf-sized, sure.\u00a0To me, anyway.\u00a0But as you know, not everyone feels that way. And the Bernie-or-Busters? I\u2019m also seeing a lot of anger and frustration directed at this group. Things like: This what happens when you decide not to\u00a0vote! So, see? Here\u2019s the thing: A majority of Bernie Sanders supporters were educated. Many of them know the basic ins and outs of the political process. When they started a movement and decided not to vote, in effect, they were putting into motion the outcome that Bernie tried to avoid by not running as an Independent candidate. The votes that were going to go to Hillary would be split between Hillary and Bernie, giving Donald the win. So, \u201cHillary\u2019s votes\u201d were split between she and Bernie, anyway. Because those Bernie or Busters made a decision. They decided that it was time to send Washington a message that business as usual will no longer be tolerated. And you don\u2019t send Washington a message by electing Hillary Clinton. She IS Washington. So we can probably stop trying to shame that group, because we aren\u2019t telling them anything they didn\u2019t already know. Anyway, what I learned from my reading today is that I should be paying close attention to my actions, even when I\u2019m terrified, so that I don\u2019t end up becoming that which I loathe: smug, arrogant, preachy (oops!), cruel, critical and accusatory of others without knowing their story, hateful, xenophobic, etc. etc. etc. DRUMPF IS ONE\u00a0MAN He was elected by a country who has had enough. In many cases (though definitely not all), he was chosen on the ballot as the lesser of two evils, rather than the greater of two goods. That suggests to me that while racism, and sexism, and ageism are alive and kicking here, maybe there\u2019s also more good than I had allowed myself to previously see.
