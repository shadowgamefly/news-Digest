The announcement comes in the midst of a massive advertiser exodus following revelations that he and Fox News paid millions of dollars to five women who said they were sexually harassed by O\u2019Reilly. O\u2019Reilly said that he booked this vacation \u201clast fall\u201d and that he often takes vacation \u201caround this time of the year.\u201d He is reportedly scheduled to return in on April 24. But Gabriel Sherman, a journalist for New York Magazine who literally wrote the book on Fox News, reports that \u201ctonight\u2019s show could be his last.\u201d According to Sherman\u2019s sources, lawyers for Fox News \u201care currently doing a \u2018deep dive\u2019 investigation into O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior.\u201d Sherman also reports that James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, wants O\u2019Reilly gone.

The number of ads on the show has dramatically declined and large national brands have been replaced with ads for Elvis gospel albums and catheters. Lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s accusers, said earlier this week that she expects more women to come forward.
