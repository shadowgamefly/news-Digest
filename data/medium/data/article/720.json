{"name": "720", "parent": "", "content": "Putting the \u201cHip\u201d Back in\u00a0Hipmunk Improving Hipmunk\u2019s Android Experience Company and Project\u00a0Overview Hipmunk is a popular travel site that helps customers find great deals on flights, hotels, and cars by aggregating listings from a variety of travel partners including Priceline, Expedia, Booking.com, Hotels.com, and more. Basically, it\u2019s like Kayak, but with a way cuter mascot. In addition to a desktop site, Hipmunk has mobile apps available on Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store. Being an Android user (sorry Apple), I decided to take on the challenge of improving their Android app. I\u2019ll walk you through my six-step process below. Results After incorporating my changes, I achieved the following results:\u200b Step 1: Guerrilla Usability Testing\u200b Before embarking on my redesign, I needed to first uncover the pain points of Hipmunk\u2019s current design. Alongside my colleague, Terri, I headed off to the Westfield shopping mall in San Francisco to conduct my first usability tests. During the tests, I asked users to complete 2 tasks: My goal was to conduct studies with five random participants and after several hours and countless rejections, I finally succeeded! I rushed back to my laboratory to analyze my findings and uncovered several pain points, which I jotted down on sticky notes. I then used an affinity map to help me prioritize these pain points by level of importance. Through this exercise, I was able to hone in on three pain points to solve for, which I assessed were important to either the user, the business, or both:\u200b Step 2: Creating\u00a0Personas During my studies, I collected background information on my participants, which enabled me to create a user persona. Using this information, I developed the following persona: Step 3: Task Flows and UI Sketching\u200b Once I felt I had a good handle on the type of user I was designing for and their needs, I began drawing out task flows and sketching out potential solutions on paper. In the task flow below, I mapped out the current process for booking a hotel using Hipmunk\u2019s Android app. Before diving into Sketch, my design tool of choice, I drew out a few potential redesign options. This allowed me to quickly get my ideas down without spending too much time worrying about aesthetics. After getting feedback from fellow designers on my sketches, I proceeded to generate Hi-Fi mockups of my solutions. Step 4: Hi-Fi\u00a0Mockups My first design change involved tweaking the layout of the homepage to make booking hotels more intuitive. During my usability tests, I noticed that several users attempted to use the search bar and homepage images to book a hotel; however, each of these methods defaults to searching for flights.\u200b To resolve the search bar issue, I added radio buttons, which enabled users to choose how the search bar will behave. To limit the confusion caused by the homepage images, I created a separate tab view for flights, hotels, and cars. If a user wants to browse flights, they\u2019ll click through images on the \u201cFlights\u201d tab. If they\u2019re interested in hotels or cars, they\u2019ll do the same on those tabs. NOTE: Currently, you can only rent a car on the desktop site. I added the cars section to showcase what the app could look like, should Hipmunk ever decide to build that functionality into their mobile app. Next, I tackled the photo gallery issue. During my study, users struggled to find additional images of the hotel they were interested in. It wasn\u2019t clear to users that clicking on the main profile picture would take you to the photo gallery. I solved this problem by simply adding a chevron to the right of the screen. In addition to having problems getting into the gallery, several users had problems getting out of the gallery. This is because there is no visible back button on the screen once in the gallery. A simple left-facing arrow placed in the top left corner solved this problem. I also added left and right chevrons on top of the images to make it more apparent to users that they can swipe left and right. The next pain point I addressed was the difficulty involved in locating Hipmunk\u2019s refund policy\u200a\u2014\u200aand by difficult I mean virtually impossible. None of the users I tested were able to find this policy (I\u2019m assuming this was intentional) so I sought to make it easier to locate. Originally, the refund policy was buried in Hipmunk\u2019s Terms of Service, which was hidden under a secondary menu. In my redesign, I created a new FAQ page, which could be accessed through the main menu. My final design tweak involved two changes to the menu. First, I added a new section for the FAQ page that I created. Second, I changed the \u201cDiscover\u201d label to \u201cHome\u201d and the compass icon to a standard home icon. I made this change because during my usability tests, I witnessed several users struggle to find their way back the homepage as it was unclear to them what the term \u201cDiscover\u201d actually meant. This replacement eliminated the ambiguity. Step 5: Interactive Prototype\u200b Once I completed all of my Hi-Fi mockups, I created an interactive prototype using Marvel. I then used this prototype to validate my design solutions. Step 6: Validation Now that my prototype was complete, it was time to do a final round of usability testing to see if my changes actually solved the identified pain points. I tested 5 different users and asked them to complete the same tasks as before. The results were as follows:\u200b\u200b\u200b Although there are still plenty of improvements to be made, based on the results of the latest usability tests, I conclude that my changes significantly improved the usability of Hipmunk\u2019s Android app. With these changes, users could more quickly and easily book hotels, enter and exit photos galleries, and find answers to their most common questions. If that\u2019s not a win, then I don\u2019t know what is! Thanks for\u00a0Reading!
