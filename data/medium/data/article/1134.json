{"name": "1134", "parent": "", "content": "A Trump Administration Official Was Involved in a Bush-Era Purge of Gay Employees A government investigation found that Jim Renne was a key player in a scandal in which staff were targeted on the basis of sexual orientation. By Justin Elliott It was one of the uglier scandals of the Bush administration: Top officials at an agency dedicated to protecting whistle-blowers launched a campaign against their own employees based on suspected sexual orientation, according to an inspector general report. Staffers were abruptly re-assigned from Washington, D.C., to a new office 500 miles away in Detroit in what the head of the office reportedly described as an effort to \u201cship [them] out.\u201d Staffers who refused were fired. Crude anti-gay emails were found in the agency chief\u2019s account. Now one of the major players in the scandal has a new assignment: He works in the Trump administration. In December, James Renne was appointed to the Trump \u201clanding team\u201d at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, as part of the transition effort between the election and the inauguration. He was then hired January 30th in a senior role at the Department of Agriculture, though his exact job duties are not clear. Renne was part of the wave of early political appointees on so-called \u201cbeachhead teams,\u201d whose role is to lay the groundwork for the new administration\u2019s policies. (We published details on hundreds of beachhead hires, obtained through public records requests.) The White House Just Announced It Won\u2019t Go After Federal Protections for LGBT AmericansIt seems religious freedom is a losing argument, even on the right.psmag.com In the Bush administration, Renne was hired in 2004 as deputy special counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, the small federal agency that is supposed to protect employees across the government from retaliation for whistle-blowing. The tenures of Renne and his boss, Special Counsel Scott Bloch, were almost immediately mired in controversy after career employees said they were improperly fired. Language stating that job discrimination protections extend to sexual orientation also disappeared from the agency website. A little-noticed inspector general report, released in 2013, depicts Renne as a central player in the efforts. Bloch and Renne, it found, hatched the plan to abruptly open a new \u201cMidwest Field Office\u201d in Detroit and re-assign career staff there. Employees who declined to move lost their jobs. The report found that the employees were targeted for no legitimate reason, pointing to \u201cfacts which reflect that Bloch and Renne may have been motivated in their actions by a negative personal attitude toward homosexuality and individuals whose orientation is homosexual.\u201d One evening shortly after he was hired in 2004, Renne took the lead in removing the language from the agency\u2019s website about how job protections cover sexual orientation, the report says. From the report: \u201cMr. Renne was depicted as intently searching the OSC website with the assistance of a senior career official to identify passages, which interpreted [the non-discrimination law] as extending protection to employees on the basis of their sexual orientation. According to this account, Mr. Renne demanded that OSC\u2019s information technology manager remove these materials from the website immediately.\u201d That change was later the subject of congressional hearings. Renne did not respond to requests for comment. The Department of Agriculture, which hired him, declined to comment. The scandal at the Office of Special Counsel dragged on for years, spawning congressional and criminal investigations. In a formal complaint filed at the time, the employees who were reassigned to Detroit pointed to a \u201cConcerned Catholic Attorneys\u201d letter Renne had signed in 2000 that is a broadside against a range of gay rights efforts. It warns that the \u201chomosexual lobby\u2019s power has grown exponentially.\u201d The inspector general report found that Renne played a central role in the plan to open a Detroit office, noting that \u201cthe reorganization was formulated by Mr. Bloch and Mr. Renne very early in their tenure.\u201d An outside consultant they hired to help with the plan told investigators that \u201cit appeared that Mr. Bloch may have been heavily influenced by Mr. Renne.\u201d That consultant, retired Lieutenant General Richard Trefry, told investigators: Mr. Bloch indicated to General Trefry that there was a sizeable group of homosexuals employed by OSC, which had developed during the years prior to his taking office, that he \u201chad a license\u201d to get rid of homosexual employees, and that he intended to \u201cship them out.\u201d The report continues: Further, in the portions of Mr. Bloch\u2019s official e-mail account that were available to the investigative team, there were crude and vulgar messages containing anti-homosexual themes that appeared to have been forwarded from his personal email.\u00a0\u2026 Similarly, Mr. Bloch\u2019s public media references to [his predecessor as Special Counsel, Elaine] Kaplan contained repeated, negatively-phrased assertions regarding her sexual orientation. For example, in interviews he granted during 2007, Mr. Bloch described her as a \u201clesbian activist,\u201d a \u201cpublic lesbian,\u201d a \u201cwell-known gay activist\u201d, and similar depictions. Now in private practice, Bloch told ProPublica the report is \u201cfilled with untruth, outright falsehoods, and innuendo.\u201d When the report was released, Bloch denied that he ever talked about targeting gay employees. The inspector general report says it was based on interviews with more than 60 people and examination of over 100,000 emails. The Trump Administration Is Pretending Older LGBTQ Americans Don\u2019t ExistHHS is looking to erase LGBTQ seniors from an annual survey that determines services for older Americans.psmag.com The affected employees ultimately came to a settlement with the government. The terms were not released. During the investigation into his tenure, Bloch\u2019s home and office were raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and he ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge arising from his hiring the company Geeks on Call to do a \u201cseven-level wipe\u201d on his government computers. Years later, Bloch later unsuccessfully sued the government over his firing. There\u2019s little public record of what Renne has been doing since his time working with Bloch. The Trump landing team announcement identified him as working for Renne Law. A fellow member of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence landing team said that Renne had worked at the ODNI inspector general office. And Bloch said he also heard that Renne had gotten a job in the intelligence community after their work together. An ODNI spokesman declined to comment.
