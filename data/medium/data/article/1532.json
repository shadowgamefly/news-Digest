If we would want to appeal rationally to Russia,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for the Russian leadership to reevaluate what they are doing. Why they are supporting a regime that is committing mass murder against its own people. So, Russia could be part of the solution. Right now I think everyone in the world sees Russia as part of the problem.\u201d McMaster continued, insinuating that he believed Russia had to be knowledgeable of Syria\u2019s plan to launch a chemical attack. \u201cI think what we should do is ask Russia how could it be, if you have advisors at that airfield, that you didn\u2019t know that the Syrian Air Force was preparing and executing a mass murder attack with chemical weapons? I think we ought to ask them that question.\u201d The U.S. military strategy on Syria has complicated Trump\u2019s attempt to warm relations with Russia.

Voice of America reported Sunday that a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin has been cancelled. But for Russia or any other nation, McMaster said, supporting Syria\u2019s regime isn\u2019t in its best interest, and Russia ultimately decides the kind of relationship it wants with the United States. \u201cIt can be whatever they wanted to be,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cDo they want to be a relationship in which we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest?
