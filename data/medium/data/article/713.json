{"name": "713", "parent": "", "content": "10 Steps for better Onboarding Experience Onboarding is one of the most crucial elements of every app. Very often, it will determine whether a user will continue using an app or not because of how simple it is to use. Onboarding is way more than just 5 intro screens and explanatory tooltips on a user interface. I\u2019ve described my onboarding process below using the most interesting examples. 1. Focus on User\u00a0Goals Let\u2019s start with a simple question: What is our user\u2019s main goal? Why are they using our app? For example: Whatsapp\u2019s purpose is to connect the users with their friends. To achieve our goal we usually have to complete some additional, unrelated tasks that only distant us from desired goals. These steps should be limited to minimum. 2. Create customer\u00a0journey The next step is to create a path the user has to take to achieve his goal. Focus on key moments like \u201cOpening the App for the first time\u201d, \u201cCreating a profile\u201d or \u201cChoosing your first contact\u201d. The last step is the most important\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the moment when the user achieves his goal. Airbnb created Journey map to show user process Flight Experience by\u00a0LEGO Cellphone purchasing experience by Jessica\u00a0Tien To learn some more about customer journey check Megan\u2019s extensive article 3. Cut out useless\u00a0s**t For each step reduce user input to a minimum and explain in detail why you need information that is absolutely necessary. Everything else should be available to update later. In this step focus solely on the goal; achieving it makes the user return to your app. The goal isn\u2019t adding an avatar to your profile, filling in your location or creating a profile. Appear.in lets you jump right into the video call without any obstacles like having to sign up or choosing a\u00a0name 4. Introduce features one by\u00a0one Most of the time, users focus on one feature. But what if we want to explain more than a single feature? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Medium app. We have the main feature\u200a\u2014\u200areading articles. On the other hand, Medium lets us create articles. We don\u2019t want to explain how to write articles for users only interested in consuming content. In this case we should create an app porch\u200a\u2014\u200aa place where we define who we are dealing with, and give the proper instructions. Medium Introduces writing features only if you try to write an\u00a0article. Youtube introduces Live Streaming feature only in dedicated tab 5. Do it interactively Way too often I see onboardings completely detached from the app itself. Static text is the least engaging way to introduce features and explain the rules of our app. Instead, try to make use of the app\u2019s mechanics. It\u2019s a great way to utilize already designed interface solutions. Slack uses its bot feature to introduce app features and fill in personal information. Trello uses cards to introduce features in a simple\u00a0way 6. Explain why you need\u00a0it No one likes to waste time filling out long forms and reading onboarding instructions. Unfortunately, in some cases it\u2019s inevitable. To ease the pain, let the user know which exact information is mandatory to fill in. A good explanation will decrease the number of users closing the app. GetResponse clearly shows what the inputted text is used\u00a0for. Clear information why birthday information is important by\u00a0Apple 7. Let them\u00a0play Don\u2019t force anything. Some users like to explore on their own. Be sure you always have a \u201cskip\u201d button visible. It allows exploratory users to have fun. It also helps returning users, who already know your app. 8.Tailor onboarding to different user\u00a0goals This step is well known to game designers. Some features are dedicated to advanced users and should be promoted only to them (it doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be available to everyone). As a result, your user will have a less steep, longer learning curve and won\u2019t be overwhelmed by options. Evernote recognizes user goal by simply asking\u00a0user 9. Make use of your blank\u00a0screens If your app starts with a blank slate, try to use it in a way to help your user understand your tool. A good idea is to suggest popular user content or create sample data. 10. Talk to your user 1 on\u00a01 Last, but not least! Talk to your user! Talk often. There\u2019s no better source of information than 1 on 1 interviews. You\u2019ll be amazed by how they use your app and how different their problems are with navigating around your app. Wrapping it\u00a0up Onboarding is difficult and fragile matter. Take your time and try the process described in my article. Be sure to involve users. Number of discovered issues might be hard to tackle, but keep on fighting for better experience! Fixing problems iteratively is inevitable element of every design process. With each session you\u2019ll observe improvement, it\u2019s the greatest motivation. Good luck!
