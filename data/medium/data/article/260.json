{"name": "260", "parent": "", "content": "9 Mantras That Changed My Life\u00a0Forever Almost a year ago, all of this started by accident. I found myself muttering the same phrase every morning as I walked my dog. 2 words: \u201cThank you.\u201d I would say those two words over and over again. A kind of chant. I probably looked a little crazy. \u201cThank you,\u00a0rock.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u00a0tree.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u00a0home.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u00a0shoes.\u201d As the months passed, I realized I was actually becoming more grateful by default. Weird. A few weeks after \u201cthe becoming,\u201d I found this story, which somehow passed me when it was published: How a Password Changed my Life.The following events occurred between \u2639 and \u263a.medium.com The guy quit smoking by changing a password?? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Then, Tony Robbins proclamation in \u201cI Am Not Your Guru.\u201d \u201cI would say to myself every\u00a0morning: I am unstoppable. I am unstoppable. I am unstoppable.\u201d He would say this for hours on end as he ran. Is he unstoppable? I don\u2019t know. He believes he is unstoppable, though, and that apparently matters. I wanted more. Could there be something to this mantra thing? Does it really change you? \u201cMantra\u201d comes from a Sanskrit root meaning \u201ca sacred message or text, charm,\u00a0spell\u201d \u201cSacred.\u201d \u201cCharm.\u201d \u201cSpell.\u201d These are all words we don\u2019t care for much in this day and age. They scare us because we can\u2019t see them. It\u2019s funny how a lot of the best outcomes in life require faith. I actually got a frustrated researching this phenomenon. Most of what comes up when you look for \u201chow words affect the brain,\u201d is anecdotal information from adrenaline-fueled-entrepreneur corners of the Internet. The rest is difficult to separate from the religious roots from which the practice began. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I was curious how language specifically affects the body. Instead, I came away with \u201cSPEAK YOUR DREAMS INTO REALITY(!),\u201d and other such high-flying quotables. (By the way, this is not the first time I\u2019ve run into this missing facts problem. It\u2019s becoming more plain to me people spout catchy-sounding stat bites without sources. Our blind trust of the Internet is very scary. \u201c9 out of 10 businesses fail.\u201d Do they really? Where is your source? What time frame are you talking about? For that matter, what does \u201cfailure\u201d really mean? And what qualifies as a \u201cbusiness.\u201d But I digress.) So it seems, on the matter of mantras, that I will have to ask you for a little faith. This is my experience, which is all I can ever offer you anyway. As I looked back, I\u2019ve had different mantras through the years\u200a\u2014\u200athose which have been a point of constant focus and attention for an extended amount of time. Each of them has changed my life in a profound way. Thinking these things did not change my life. I spoke them aloud as often as possible. Like a crazy person. 1. \u201cLOVE IS SACRIFICE\u201d Romantic or platonic, not much speaks louder than giving up something you care about for another person. 2. \u201cFOCUS ON\u00a0FOUR\u201d This connected culture makes us think we have to impact 4,000 people to be important\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe 4 MILLION! That\u2019s too many friends. Instead, focus on four. If four people are bawling at your funeral, you nailed it. 3. \u201cNO DAYS\u00a0OFF\u201d When I left on my 5 A.M. alarm for Saturday and Sunday, these things happened: (See also\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Tweak Has Made All the Difference In Your Life?) 4. \u201cTHERE\u2019S MORE WHERE THAT CAME\u00a0FROM\u201d Most people have a deep fear: One day, they will run out of ideas. (gasp) Writer\u2019s block specifically has reached legendary status over the years. The word has a plague-like reputation. Once you are afflicted, you will be doomed to a life with the \u201cnormies.\u201d Here\u2019s the truth: All blocks are self-inflicted. The human brain is infinite, constantly processing new thoughts and emotions and stimuli and interactions. It is ever-searching, ever-seeking, and rarely at rest. I heard recently that Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) doesn\u2019t even plan comics ahead of time now. He just sits at the desk and starts. Even though he\u2019s been making office jokes since 1989, there\u2019s more where that came from. 5. \u201c30 x 30 x\u00a030\u201d If you do just 30 seconds more of what you love day after day, you will likely be much more fulfilled at the end of a year. If you spend 30 consecutive days acting on an interest and don\u2019t hate it, you have likely found a potential career. (If you do hate it, at least you explored the option.) If you plan on taking 30 years to build exactly the life you want, you will have much more patience for the little bumps along the way. 6. \u201cI LOVE YOU, BUT I CAN\u2019T GIVE YOU MY FOCUS RIGHT\u00a0NOW.\u201d What has suffered in this generation is our ability to work deeply. We settle for shallow interactions, quick dopamine hits, and endless entertainment. Ignore things that are mildly important to obsess over that which is most important. 7. \u201cHEALTH COMES\u00a0FIRST\u201d I wasn\u2019t able to accomplish much in 2014. A large reason for this was because it felt like my guts were about to fall out of my stomach at any moment. Sustainable health is the foundation to sustainable anything else. 8. \u201c80% LOVE, 20% BUSINESS\u201d My friend told me once: \u201cSEO is the only way to\u00a0win.\u201d No. The only way to win is doing things that energize you at least 80% of the time. Use the other 20% to set up a structure which will increase that 80% to 100%. 9. \u201cCREATION BEATS AFFIRMATION\u201d One of the great ironies of life is this: the praise which follows success can stonewall your progress. Affirmation is a fickle, hollow drug. Do not allow it to own your self esteem. Instead, create new work. Improve your process. Continue to grow. These things you control. There\u2019s (Even) More Where This Came\u00a0From Have you ever worried you might become worthless? I know I did. Once I wrote my first viral hit, I would terrified I could never write another. First I was paralyzed. Then I was liberated. Now, millions of people have read my work all over the world. I\u2019ve wrapped up the epiphany between paralyzed and liberated in my book: The Ultimate Guide to Infinite Ideas, which I\u2019m giving away for free. Get your copy right here.
