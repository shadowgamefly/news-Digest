CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak On Thursday, House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced he was stepping down from the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. Nunes blamed \u201caccusations\u201d by \u201cseveral leftwing activist groups\u201d for triggering an actually-very-real investigation into Nunes\u2019 alleged improper handling of intelligence. His chosen replacement? Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), a senior member of the committee, and a strong Trump supporter during the campaign. That support has not waned since Trump was elected and could cause problems for someone taking over an investigation marred by accusations of collusion with the White House. Conaway, who is now charged with investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, compared Russian cyber attacks on Democrats to Mexican entertainers energizing Democratic voters. He told the Dallas Morning News in January: Harry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into Las Vegas, to entertain, get out the vote and so forth. Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don\u2019t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. Asked if this was really the same as Russian email hacking of private information to support one candidate, Conaway said, \u201cSure it is, it\u2019s foreign influence. If we\u2019re worried about foreign influence, let\u2019s have the whole story.\u201d He pointed to the Democratic electoral success in Nevada in 2016, saying the Mexican singers who campaigned there \u201care monster in the Hispanic community.\u201d \u201cHe knows there\u2019s a big difference between Vicente Fernandez performing at a Hillary Clinton event and Vladimir Putin ordering interference with our elections,\u201d fellow Intelligence Committee member Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) said in response. \u201cThe intelligence community has indicated that Vladimir Putin essentially ordered cyberwarfare, and nothing else compares to that.\u201d Prior to the election, Conaway hewed to the traditional Republican position more critical of Russian aggression, stating on his congressional website in 2014 that Putin is a \u201cmegalomaniac\u201d and that his aggressive actions were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Since the election, Conaway\u2019s website has been quiet when it comes to Russian actions against the United States. Conaway: \u201cThat might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife\u2019s [Texas Tech] Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns\u200a\u2014\u200ashe really likes the Red Raiders.\u00a0\u2026 The logic is that because [Putin] really didn\u2019t like presidential candidate Clinton that he automatically liked Trump? That assessment is based on what?\u201d Comey: \u201cIt\u2019s based on more than that, but part of it\u00a0\u2026 is the logic. Whoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win, by definition you want their opponents to lose.\u201d Conaway: \u201cI know, but this says\u00a0\u2026 [Russia] wanted both of them, her to lose and him to win.\u201d Comey: \u201cThey\u2019re inseparable. It\u2019s a two-person thing.\u201d Conaway: \u201cI\u2019m just wondering when you decided [Russia] wanted him to win.\u201d Comey: \u201cWell, logically, when they wanted her to lose.\u201d Conaway stuck with Trump after the Access Hollywood video of him bragging about groping women surfaced and roiled the campaign. He told the Abilene Reporter-News on October 13 that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201chorrible, awful, and he\u2019s probably embarrassed,\u201d but noted that \u201cno candidate is perfect.\u201d The reason Trump didn\u2019t lose Conaway\u2019s support? \u201cIt\u2019s a binary choice, Clinton or Trump.\u00a0\u2026 He (Trump) is still the one I\u2019m supporting. I refuse to do anything that would help Hillary become president.\u201d Conaway\u2019s wife, Suzanne, was also not fazed by the Access Hollywood tape, telling CNN in October that she still supported Trump and traveling the country in a \u201cWomen Stump for Trump\u201d bus tour. She dismissed the accounts of Trump sexually assaulting women as \u201cunsubstantiated allegations.\u201d During the 2016 election, Conaway served on the executive board of the Trump campaign\u2019s Agriculture Advisory Committee. After Trump\u2019s widely-panned inaugural address that angrily described \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d Rep. Conaway told the San Angelo Standard-Times that Trump\u2019s detractors should be hopeful, because \u201csuccess brings a lot of healing.\u201d He said he thought the speech \u201cappealed to a broad swath of both sides, people who feel they have not been represented in the White House,\u201d and was \u201cexcited to be able to work with the White House for the first time in eight years.\u201d When millions of people demonstrated against Trump the day after inauguration, Conaway\u2019s response was to criticize the foul language that appeared on some protesters\u2019 signs. \u201cThere was a taint to that march that just cut me to the core,\u201d he said at a later event at the Agriculture Department. \u201cWomen carrying signs and wearing costumes in the foulest, nastiest, crudest, crassest manner possible, talking about female body parts.\u201d Conaway was aware that the reason many people made signs of that nature was in direct response to Trump\u2019s own foul boasting, but Conaway found more fault with the signs. \u201cThe trigger for that obviously was Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange with Billy Bush, which should never have happened, it was never excused in a private conversation, but now it\u2019s perfectly all right to carry signs as badges of honor across this nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Conaway concluded. House Republicans cancel all hearings on Russian investigation, blame DemocratsNunes and Gowdy say Democrats are obstructing things. They aren\u2019t.thinkprogress.org Trump gets Conaway\u2019s benefit of the doubt in national security matters, too. Conaway said that Trump\u2019s accusation that Obama wiretapped him was understandable because Trump is \u201cnot someone who\u2019s spent a lot of his career talking about intelligence issues and police investigations, those kinds of things.\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said Nunes \u201ccontinues to have [his] trust\u201d amid the Ethics investigation and also said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that Conaway would \u201cfollow the facts wherever they lead.\u201d Conaway will have Reps Trey Gowdy (R-SC), and Tom Rooney (R-FL) as deputies to assist him in the probe.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) called Nunes\u2019 move a \u201cfresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands.\u201d He said he looked forward to partnering with Conaway \u201cand putting our investigation fully back on track.\u201d ", "title": "Republican now leading Russia probe has a history of making wild claims in defense of\u00a0Trump", "sentences": [{"9db0": "Republican now leading Russia probe has a history of making wild claims in defense of\u00a0Trump"}, {"e4f3": "The new Devin Nunes is a lot like the old Devin\u00a0Nunes."}, {"6ced": "Rep.
