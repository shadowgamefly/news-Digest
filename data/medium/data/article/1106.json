We join in solidarity with many others who are also hearing these cries, knowing that together we can be a remarkable force for transformation and liberation.\u201d \u201cBuddhism is respected around the world as a religion of compassion and peace,\u201d it adds. \u201cWe are wanted and needed in this movement, and we have much to contribute.\u201d \u201cIf the policies of the new administration prevail, millions of people in vulnerable and less privileged communities will\u00a0suffer.\u201d Signers stressed that \u201cBuddhism does not align itself with any party or ideology,\u201d but noted that the current political moment is a unique. \u201cIf the policies of the new administration prevail, millions of people in vulnerable and less privileged communities will suffer,\u201d the statement, which doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name, reads. \u201cHopes will be dashed. Undoubtedly, lives will be lost. International conflict will intensify and environmental destruction will worsen.\u201d The letter also suggested various ways for Buddhists to aid the vulnerable during the Trump era, such as joining protests or lending their worship spaces to the New Sanctuary Movement to aid undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. \u201cOur Buddhist communities can become centers of protection and vision,\u201d it reads. \u201cThis can take many forms. It can mean providing sanctuary for those in danger or skilfully confronting those whose actions would harm the vulnerable among us. It can be standing up for the environment or becoming an active ally for those targeted by hate and prejudice.\u201d Vatican, U.S. bishops want Trump to \u2018reconsider\u2019 his stance on climateTop-level cardinal hopes the president will listen to \u201cdissenting voices.\u201dthinkprogress.org Signatories included a host of prominent Buddhist teachers and thinkers, including 13 major names such as author Jack Kornfield, writer Rev. angel Kyodo williams, Roshi Joan Halifax, and monk-activist Bhikkhu Bodhi. \u201cNow\u2026that the Trump administration has been issuing executive orders and proposing bills and policies that clash so strongly with Buddhist ethical values, even the most reticent Buddhist teachers are starting to feel the need to speak up,\u201d Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi told ThinkProgress in an email. He noted that he tentatively expects Buddhists to make similar statements in the future. Buddhists make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, according to PRRI, representing a wide array of traditions and theological schools. Melvin McLeod, editor-in-chief of Lion\u2019s Roar magazine, lauded this diversity as a strength of the community, but said sweeping expressions of political solidarity such as Monday\u2019s letter\u200a\u2014\u200awhile certainly not unprecedented\u200a\u2014\u200aare \u201cquite unusual.\u201d \u201cI think it is really the first time such a broad and diverse group of Buddhist teachers have come together,\u201d McLeod told ThinkProgress. \u201cIt does represent a broad consensus of Buddhist teachers.\u201d The letter is the latest in a growing wave of faith-based opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda. Since his election in November, progressive and conservative religious groups have voiced passionate resistance to the president\u2019s cabinet nominations, plan to repeal Obamacare, both versions of the Muslim ban, budget proposals, and stance on climate change, among other issues. This post was updated to include comments from Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. It was also corrected to remove a quote attributed to Bodhi that was actually Bodhi quoting McLeod.
