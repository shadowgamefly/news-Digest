Follow us on Facebook for continued coverage on the SCOTUS nomination. Chief Judge Merrick\u00a0Garland Garland is unquestionably qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. A 19 year veteran of the DC Circuit\u200a\u2014\u200aa court that is widely viewed as the second-most powerful in the nation\u200a\u2014\u200aGarland graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Justice William Brennan, and spent a few years as a partner in the multinational law firm Arnold and Porter. He also held senior positions in the Justice Department, including a leadership role in the department\u2019s criminal division and a stint as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. At age 63, Garland is also the oldest person nominated to the Supreme Court since President Nixon named Justice Lewis Powell in 1971. Thus, if confirmed, Garland is unlikely to match\u200a\u2014\u200aor even approach\u200a\u2014\u200aJustice Scalia\u2019s nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court. 6 Quotes From Senate Republicans About Merrick Garland That Are Really Awkward NowJustice by CREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed moments after\u2026thinkprogress.org Garland\u2019s relatively advanced age may help explain why Hatch floated the DC Circuit chief judge as his ideal Obama nominee. Another factor that almost certainly played a role is Garland\u2019s reputation for moderation. In 2003, for example, Garland joined an opinion holding that the federal judiciary lacks the authority \u201cto assert habeas corpus jurisdiction at the behest of an alien held at a military base leased from another nation, a military base outside the sovereignty of the United States\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aan opinion that effectively prohibited Guantanamo Bay detainees from seeking relief in civilian courts. A little over a year later, the Supreme Court reversed this decision in Rasul v. Bush. Although, in fairness, it should be noted that legal experts disagree about whether the decision Garland joined was mandated by existing precedents. The former prosecutor also has a relatively conservative record on criminal justice. A 2010 examination of his decisions by SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Tom Goldstein determined that \u201cJudge Garland rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants\u2019 appeals of their convictions.\u201d Goldstein \u201cidentified only eight such published rulings,\u201d in addition to seven where \u201che voted to reverse the defendant\u2019s sentence in whole or in part, or to permit the defendant to raise a argument relating to sentencing on remand,\u201d during the 13 years Garland had then spent on the DC Circuit. To be clear, Garland\u2019s record does not suggest that he would join the Court\u2019s right flank if confirmed to the Supreme Court. He would likely vote much more often than not with the Supreme Court\u2019s liberals, while occasionally casting a heterodox vote. Nevertheless, as Goldstein wrote in 2010 when Garland was under consideration to replace the retiring liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, \u201cto the extent that the President\u2019s goal is to select a nominee who will articulate a broad progressive vision for the law, Judge Garland would be a very unlikely candidate to take up that role.\u201d That Awkward Moment When The GOP's Top Judicial Attack Dog Sang Merrick Garland's PraisesJustice by CREDIT: AP Photo/Evan Vucci Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland once earned considerable praise from a\u2026thinkprogress.org The Garland nomination, in other words, appears to be an attempt to box in Senate Republicans who\u2019ve refused to confirm anyone Obama nominates. There are strong reasons to doubt whether this strategy will work, however. Sen. Hatch, who undoubtedly regrets his decision to praise Garland shortly before this nomination, has outright refused to meet with anyone Obama nominates to replace Scalia.
