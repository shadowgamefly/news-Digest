{"name": "1542", "parent": "", "content": "The House just moved toward eliminating the agency that protects elections from\u00a0hacking A committee voted to terminate the Election Assistance Commission. Just months after an election plagued with foreign influence, a Republican-controlled House committee voted Tuesday to eliminate the independent, bipartisan agency tasked with helping states secure their voting systems. The Committee on House Administration voted 6\u20133, along party lines, to move forward with the Election Assistance Commission Termination Act, legislation that would eliminate the only agency responsible for making sure voting machines cannot be hacked. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was formed in the wake of the disastrous 2000 election to administer federal help to states to update and improve their voting systems. In recent years, the agency has worked to ensure that elections are accessible to those with disabilities, allocated funds for innovative election technology, and studied and reported election best practices, among other roles. Thomas Hicks, one of three commissioners currently on the EAC, told ThinkProgress that eliminating the agency would be \u201ca huge mistake.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only agency that deals with the administration of elections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe touch 8,000 jurisdictions across the country, from voter registration to the counting of ballots... My read of the [termination] bill is that it just eliminates the agency but doesn\u2019t move the responsibilities around.\u201d In a preliminary vote Tuesday, the House committee decided to bring the issue to the entire chamber for a vote. Rep. Gregg Harper (R-MS), the chairman of the committee, argued that the EAC was formed as a temporary agency, and that the issues it was designed to address have been resolved. But a number of voting rights organizations have pushed back on that claim. Before Tuesday\u2019s vote, the Brennan Center for Justice wrote a letter to Harper and the ranking Democratic member of the House committee, urging them to vote against the EAC termination legislation. \u201cA lot of Americans are expressing concerns right now about the security of the election system and their confidence in the election system,\u201d said Tomas Lopez, counsel with the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program. \u201cThe EAC is exactly the kind of place that can actually address the concerns that people have.\u201d A group of 38 organizations and individuals, including the League of Women Voters and the NAACP, also wrote a letter urging the committee to oppose the legislation, and to instead strengthen the EAC and provide it with the additional staff it needs. At full capacity, the EAC should have four commissioners working to respond to election issues. While Russian hacking appears to have been a problem unique to the 2016 election, Hicks said that every election brings new challenges, which speaks to the need for the EAC. \u201cIn 2012, it was long lines, and the agency was not actually up and running,\u201d he said, referring to the almost four-year period ending in December 2014 when the EAC had no commissioners. \u201cThe president had to use an executive order to have an outside commission look at these problems, when I think that\u2019s something our agency was formed to do,\u201d he said. That three-year period was not the only time the agency has been criticized for inaction, and Hicks admitted that the EAC is not perfect. But he said that given its ongoing work, it\u2019s vital that the agency is allowed to continue functioning. Currently, the EAC is working to update the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, a set of set of requirements that states can use to check that their voting systems are functional, accessible, and secure. Without those requirements, states would suffer, Hicks said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s voluntary, 47 out of 50 states use some form of it,\u201d he said. The guidelines have not been updated since 2007, Hicks added, pointing out how far technology has come in the last decade. \u201cWe really need to be working on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge issue that needs to be dealt with.\u201d The legislation will now move to the full Republican-controlled House, whose GOP members have in the past been opponents of legislation that would make it easier to vote.
