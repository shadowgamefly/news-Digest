{"name": "818", "parent": "", "content": "I Interrupt My Regularly Scheduled Post\u2026 Or I Have an Announcement that Could Probably\u00a0Wait Dear People of Earth (i.e., the tiny section of humanity that's currently reading this), I like to think of myself as a good communicator so I wanted to let all four of you know what I\u2019m planning (I hope I\u2019m up to four readers by now. Really? It\u2019s still only two. Damn. Hi, Mom and Dad). After much intense deliberation\u200a\u2014\u200aduring which time I attempted to numb painful dental work with Netflix, alcohol and pureed French fries*\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve come to a very difficult conclusion: You should always floss even when you\u2019re really, really tired. Also, as of this week, I\u2019m gonna start posting every OTHER Wednesday. At least for the next few weeks. So this post isn\u2019t really a post-post, it\u2019s just the best way I know how to tell everyone (Mom, Dad) not to be surprised that I didn\u2019t actually post this week, but that I will be posting next week\u2026 and then not posting the following week, but posting the week after that week (See. I told you I was a good communicationer). Now, I assure you I have very valid reasons for changing my blogging schedule and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m lazy. If I was lazy, I wouldn\u2019t even write this, derrr. I\u2019m doing this because: (A) I\u2019ve become super busy and, more than anything, I do not want the quality of my posts to suffer. Of course, I realize I\u2019ve set a very low bar and \u201cquality\u201d is a subjective term, especially when I use it, but it could actually get worse. I know, right?! How is that even possible? Just friggin\u2019 trust me (for instance, I could start using the word \u201cfriggin\u2019\u201d). And I\u2019m afraid if I continue to write a new piece every week, there\u2019s a significant chance I\u2019ll just start posting pictures of my left knee with captions like \u201cThis is my knee\u201d and \u201cThis is my knee from a slightly different angle.\u201d Shit. Maybe I should pitch this idea to Medium under the category of \u201cPersonal Development.\u201d While some people might consider that a \u201cquality\u201d post, those people probably also like modern art\u00a0\u2026 and blogs about how getting up early leads to financial success *obscene hand gesture*. BUT most importantly: (B) I\u2019m working on my very own\u2026 wait for it\u2026 ThunderPuff website! Unfortunately, it\u2019s taking longer than I anticipated due to my inability to code. I really wish I could code. If I knew how to code and started getting up at 4am, I would probably be a self-actualized, time-management-life-work-balance-relationship-success-happiness-guru, millionaire by now. See you next week! *Recipe for Vodka Fries\u2122 You basically have two options: Note: Do NOT use flavored vodka. Far More Important Note: Don\u2019t do any of this. It\u2019s gross.
