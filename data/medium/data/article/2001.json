I doubt this is going where you think. I am the exception. I love my weekly trip to the grocery store. I especially like it when I have taken the time to pick out 6 or 7 recipes for the week. I make a list and all is right with the world. Oh sweet certainty, do not leave me. My world is a happier place when the decisions have been\u00a0made. I hate not having a plan. All of us looking at each other around 6 p.m.. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. What do you want?\u201d \u201cDo we have anything?\u201d \u201cWell this, but it is frozen. Or that, but we are missing x y or z to make it complete.\u201d Ughhhhhhh!!!!! The summer, with its irregular and ever changing venues, puts a real damper on my meal plan and prep. We eat way too much junk and not enough good. I feel bad about not putting tasty and healthy meals on the table and in mouths. I dare say I am a better than average cook and take pride in a nutritious meal on the table. It is the one thing my tribe almost always remembers to thank me for doing. So with the Labor Day weekend behind us, I pulled out my recipe binder. I selected six favorite recipes, made my list and headed for the grocery. Everything has been unpacked. The pantry, refrigerator and freezer are stocked. I have six to seven answers to the question of, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d For this, I give thanks.
