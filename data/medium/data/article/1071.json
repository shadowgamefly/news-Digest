Secret Sauce breaks down every channel just like this one, so if you think this is valuable check it out. It\u2019s for sale now. SEO In One\u00a0Day SEO is simply not as hard as people pretend like it is; you can get 95% of the effort with 5% of the work, and you absolutely do not need to hire a professional SEO to do it, nor will it be hard to start ranking for well-picked key terms. Of all the channels we\u2019ll be discussing, SEO is the one that there is the most misinformation about. Some of it is subtle, but some of it is widely spread and believed by so-called SEO consultants who actually don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. SEO is very simple, and unless you\u2019re a very large company it\u2019s probably not worth hiring somebody else to do. How Google\u00a0Works In order to understand what we need to do for SEO let\u2019s look back at how Google started, how it\u2019s evolving today, and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on Google. The Early Days of\u00a0Google The idea for PageRank\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle\u2019s early ranking algorithm\u200a\u2014\u200astemmed from Einstein. Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote\u200a\u2014\u200athe more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and rank them. They realized that because of links, the Internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could use links. So they set about attempting to \u201cdownload\u201d (or crawl) the entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if you did a search for \u201cuniversity,\u201d they could look at the pages that talked about \u201cuniversity\u201d and rank them. Google Today Google works largely the same way today, although with much more sophistication and nuance. For example, not all links carry the same weight. A link from an authoritative site (as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it) is much more valuable than a link from a non-authoritative site. A link from the New York Times is probably worth about 10,000 links from sites that don\u2019t have much authority. At the end of the day the purpose of Google is to find the \u201cbest\u201d (or most popular) web page for the words you type into the search bar. All this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about, and then make it clear that we\u2019re popular. If we do that we win. In order to do that, we\u2019ll follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required. Gaming the\u00a0System Google is a very smart company. The sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible; bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around Silicon Valley powered by Google\u2019s algorithms. If you get too far into the SEO rabbit hole you\u2019ll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process. Automated software like RankerX, GSA SER, and Scrapebox, instructions to create spam or spin content, linkwheels, PBNs, hacking domains, etc. Some of that stuff works very short term, but Google is smart and it is getting smarter. It gets harder to beat Google every day, and Google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day. Most don\u2019t even last a week before everything you\u2019ve done disappears and your work evaporates. That\u2019s not the way you should do things. Instead of Internet-based churn and burn we\u2019ll be focusing on building equity in the Internet. So if you see some highly-paid SEO consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links, or when you see some blackhatter beating the system, just know that it\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019re going to build authority and get traffic fast, but we\u2019re going to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t disappear or cripple your site in the future. On-Page SEO The first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to Google what our site is about. For now we\u2019re going to focus our home page (our landing page) on ranking for one keyword that isn\u2019t our brand or company name. Once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape, but for now we\u2019ll stay laser focused. Keyword Research The first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is. Depending on how popular our site is and how long it\u2019s been around, the level of traffic and difficulty we\u2019ll get from this effort may vary. The Long\u00a0Tail There\u2019s a concept we need to be familiar with known as the \u201clong tail.\u201d If we were to graph \u201cpopularity\u201d of most things with \u201cpopularity\u201d being the Y axis and the rank order being the X axis, we\u2019d get something like a power law graph: There are some big hits that get the majority of attention, and after a few hits the graph falls sharply. The long-tail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller. Think of Amazon. They probably have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren\u2019t bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail. In SEO this matters because, at least in the beginning, we\u2019re going to go after long tail keywords\u200a\u2014\u200avery exact, intention-driven keywords with lower competition that we know can win, then gradually we\u2019ll work our way to the left. Our site isn\u2019t going to outrank ultra-competitive keywords in the beginning, but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort. The keywords we\u2019re looking for we will refer to as \u201clong-tail keywords.\u201d Finding the Long\u00a0Tail In order to find our perfect long-tail keywords, we\u2019re going to use a combination of four tools, all of which are free. The process looks like this: Don\u2019t be intimidated\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s actually very simple. For this example we\u2019ll pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book (and we\u2019ll probably have to build out a site so you see if we\u2019re ranked there in a few months). Step 1: Brainstorming and Keyword Generating In this step we\u2019re simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work. Don\u2019t concentrate too much on culling the list at this point, as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process. So since this is a book about growth hacking, I\u2019m going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit: Growth hacking Growth marketing Internet marketing Growth hacking guide Growth hacking book Book about growth hacking What is growth hacking Growth hacking instructions That\u2019s a good enough list to start. If you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshitter.com. If you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes. Try to get a solid list of 5\u201310 to start with. Now we\u2019ll plug each keyword into UberSuggest. When I plug the first one\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cgrowth hacking\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ain, I get 246 results. Clicking \u201cview as text\u201d will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list. Go through that process with each keyword you came up with. Now we\u2019ll assume you have 500+ keywords. If you don\u2019t, try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword, and you\u2019ll have that many quickly. Ideally you\u2019ll have over 1500. Step 2: Traffic Estimating Now that we have a pretty good list of keywords. Our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while. You\u2019ll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldn\u2019t do much for us. For example, my growth hacking list came up with \u201c5 internet marketing techniques.\u201d We probably won\u2019t go after that one, but instead of guessing we can let Google do the work for us. This will be our weeding out step. Google Keyword\u00a0Planner The Google Keyword Planner is a tool meant for advertisers, but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels. Google doesn\u2019t make any promise of accuracy, so these numbers are likely only directionally correct, but they\u2019re enough to get us on the right track. You\u2019ll have to have an AdWords account to be able to use the tool, but you can create one for free if you haven\u2019t use AdWords in the past. Once you\u2019ve logged in, select \u201cGet search volume data and trends.\u201d Paste in your enormous list of keywords, and click \u201cGet search volume.\u201d Once you\u2019ve done so, you\u2019ll see a lot of graphs and data. Unfortunately the Keyword Planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within, so instead we\u2019re going to export our data to excel with the \u201cdownload\u201d button and play with it there. Now what we\u2019re going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after. This varies a bit based on how much authority your site has. So let\u2019s try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank. Go to SEMrush.com and enter your URL, looking at the total backlinks in the third column: As a general rule (this may vary based on how old your site is, who the links are from, etc.), based on the number of links you have, this is the maximum level of \u201cdifficulty\u201d you should go after. Number of Backlinks Maximum Difficulty < 30:<40 <100:40\u201350 <1000:50\u201370 1000+:70+ Go ahead and sort the data by difficulty, and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get those keywords later). For now you can simply delete those rows. Exact Match One important thing to note is that Google gives us this volume as \u201cexact match\u201d volume. This means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms, but not if they are used in a phrase, so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall. Now with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest, and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit. Here are mine: growth hacking strategies growth hacking techniques growth hacking 101 growth hacking instagram growth hacking twitter Mine all look the same, but that may not necessarily be the case. Keyword Trends Unfortunately the \u201ckeyword difficulty\u201d that Google gives us is based on paid search traffic, not on natural search traffic. First, let\u2019s use Google Trends to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously. You can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other. For my keywords it looks like this: The ones I\u2019m most excited about are purple and red, which are \u201cGrowth hacking techniques\u201d and \u201cGrowth hacking Twitter.\u201d Now we\u2019ll take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords. Manual Keyword Difficulty Analysis In order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword, we\u2019re going to have to look at the keywords manually, one by one. That\u2019s why we started by finding some long-tail keywords and narrowing the list. This process gets a lot easier if you download the SEOQuake Chrome extension. Once you\u2019ve done that, do a Google search and you\u2019ll notice a few changes. With SEOQuake turned on the relevant SEO data of each site is displayed below each search result. We\u2019re going to alter what is displayed, so in the left-hand sidebar click \u201cparameters\u201d and set them to the following: Now when you search, you\u2019ll see something like this SEOQuake adds a ranking number, and the following at the bottom: The Google Index: This is how many pages from this base URL Google has indexed Page Links: The number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to SEMrush\u2019s index (usually very low compared to reality, but since we\u2019ll be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples) URL Links: The number of pages pointing to any page on the base URL Age: The first time the page was indexed by the Internet Archive Traffic: A very rough monthly traffic number for the base URL Looking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions. You\u2019ll notice that the weight of the indicators change. Not all links are from as good of sources, direct page links matter much more than URL links, etc., but if you google around and play with it for a while you\u2019ll get a pretty good idea of what it takes. If you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one. If you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your on-page SEO in place. Generally it will be a mixture of both. Keep in mind that we\u2019re going to optimize our page for this exact keyword, so we have a bit of an advantage. That said, if you start to see pages from sites like Wikipedia, you will know it\u2019s an uphill battle. Here are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things, starting with \u201cGrowth hacking techniques.\u201d Entrepreneur.com is definitely a big name, and \u201cgrowth hacking techniques\u201d is in the title explicitly. This will be difficult to beat, but there are no links in the SEMRush index that point direct to the page. (By the way, I wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneur.com\u200a\u2014\u200aI could probably do that and build a few links to that easily, even linking to my site in the article). Yongfook.com, have never heard of that site. 206 total links, not much traffic, this one I could pass up. It does have quite a bit of age and \u201cGrowth hacking tactics\u201d in the title explicitly, so that would make it tough, but this one is doable to pass up after a while. Alright, so quicksprout is relatively popular, a lot of links, good age, lots of traffic, a few links direct to the page but not a ton. But the word \u201ctactics\u201d doesn\u2019t even appear here. This page isn\u2019t optimized for this keyword, so I could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for \u201cgrowth hacking tactics.\u201d Let\u2019s jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page. 17 total pages indexed? Created in 2014? No links in the index, even to the root URL? This one\u2019s mine. I should be able to front-page easily. So this looks like a good keyword. Now we just have to get the on-page SEO in place and start building a few links. On-Page SEO Now that we have our keyword selected, we need to make sure Google knows what our site is about. This is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places. Most of this has to do with html tags, which make up the structure of a webpage. If you don\u2019t know html or understand how it works, just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you. Here is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized. On-Page SEO Checklist \u2610 Your keyword is in the <title> tag, ideally at the front (or close to the front) of the tag \u2610 Your keyword is close to the beginning of the <title> tag (ideally the first words) \u2610 The title tag contains less than the viewable limit of 65 characters (optional but recommended) \u2610 Your keyword is in the first <h1> tag (and your page has an <h1> tag) \u2610 If your page contains additional header tags (<h2>, <h3>, etc) your keyword or synonyms are in most of them \u2610 Any images on the page have an <alt> tag that contain your chosen keyword \u2610 Your keyword is in the meta description (and there is a meta description) \u2610 There is at least 300 words of text on the page \u2610 Your keyword appears in the URL (if not the homepage) \u2610 Your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy \u2610 Your keyword (or synonyms\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle recognizes them now) is used other times throughout the page \u2610 Your keyword density is between\u00a0.5% and 2.5% \u2610 The page contains dofollow links to other pages (this just means you\u2019re not using nofollow links to every other page) \u2610 The page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site If you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an on-page perspective. You\u2019ll likely be the best-optimized page for your chosen keyword unless you\u2019re in a very competitive space. All we have left now is off-page optimization. Off-Page SEO Off-Page SEO is just a fancy way to say links. (Sometimes we call them backlinks, but it\u2019s really the same thing.) Google looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote. If you link to something, in Google\u2019s eyes you\u2019re saying, \u201cThis is worth checking out.\u201d The more legit you are the more weight your vote carries. Link Juice SEOs have a weird way to describe this voting process; they call it \u201clink juice.\u201d If an authoritative site, we\u2019ll say Wikipedia for example, links to you, they\u2019re passing you \u201clink juice.\u201d But link juice doesn\u2019t only work site to site\u200a\u2014\u200aif your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site, it passes link juice as well. For this reason our link structure becomes very important. Checking Link\u00a0Juice There are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are. Unfortunately none of them are perfect\u200a\u2014\u200athe only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages. Google crawls most popular pages several times per day, but they don\u2019t want you manipulating them, so they update their index pretty slowly. That said, you can check at least a sample of Google\u2019s index in the Google Search Console (formerly known as Webmaster Tools). Once you navigate to your site, In the left-hand side select \u201cSearch Traffic\u201d then \u201cLinks to your site.\u201d There\u2019s a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links Google knows about (I\u2019m 99% convinced it\u2019s only a sample), but it\u2019s at least a representative sample. To see all of your links, click on \u201cMore\u201d under \u201cWho links to you the most\u201d then \u201cDownload this table.\u201d This, again, seems to only download a sample of what Google knows about. You can also select \u201cDownload latest links\u201d which provides more recent links than the other option. Unfortunately this doesn\u2019t let us see much a to the value of the links, nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from. To use those there are a wide variety of tools: If you have a budget I\u2019d go with ahrefs.com as they have the biggest index, followed by Moz\u2019s Open Site Explorer (most of the data you can get with a free account, if not then it\u2019s slightly cheaper than ahrefs), and finally SEMrush, which is free for most purposes we need. MajesticSEO uses a combination of \u201ctrust flow\u201d and \u201ccitation flow\u201d which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site. All of these use different internal metrics to determine the \u201cauthority\u201d of a link, but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial. Link Structure HTML links look something like this: <a href=\u201dhttp://www.somesite.com\u201d title=\u201dkeyword\u201d>Anchor text</a> Where http://www.somesite.com is the place the link directs you to, the title is largely a remnant of time gone by, and the linked text\u200a\u2014\u200athink the words that are blue and you click on\u200a\u2014\u200ais called the \u201canchor text.\u201d In addition to the amount of link juice a page has, the relevance of the anchor text matters. Generally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible. External linking (from other sites) shouldn\u2019t be very heavily optimized for anchor text. If 90% of your links all have the same anchor text Google can throw a red flag, assuming that you\u2019re doing something fishy. If you\u2019re ever creating links (like we\u2019ll show you in the future) I only ever use something generic like the site name, \u201chere\u201d or the full URL. Internal Structure Generally speaking you don\u2019t want orphan pages (those that aren\u2019t linked to by other pages), nor do you want an overly-messy link structure. Some say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this: That\u2019s close, but it gets a couple things wrong. First, you\u2019ll never have a structure that organized, and second, in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level. This can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or \u201crecommended\u201d pages. That allows you to specify anchor text, and pass link juice freely from page to page. Unfortunately it\u2019s impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess, so you\u2019ll just have to imagine what that actually looks like. We have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site. Robots.txt, disavow, nofollow, and other\u00a0minutia Most of SEO is managing stuff that can go wrong. There is a lot of that, but we\u2019ll go over what will cover 99% of needs, and you can Google if there\u2019s something really crazy. Robots.txt Almost every site has a page at url.com/robots.txt\u200a\u2014\u200aeven google has one. This is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl. Most are pretty good about listening, except the Bingbot, which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it. (I\u2019m mostly kidding.) If you don\u2019t want Google to crawl a page (maybe it\u2019s a login page you don\u2019t want indexed, a landing page, etc.) you can just \u201cdisallow\u201d it in your robots.txt by saying disallow: /somepage. If you add a trailing / to it (e.g. disallow: /somepage/) it will also disallow all child pages. Technically you can specify different rules for different bots (or user agents), but it\u2019s easiest to start your file with \u201cUser-agent: *\u201d if you don\u2019t have a need for separate crawling rules. Disavow Google will penalize spammy sites, and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors. Say, for example, you wanted to take out a competitor. You could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized. This is called \u201cnegative SEO,\u201d and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords. Google generally tries to pretend like it doesn\u2019t happen. In the case that this does happen, however, you can \u201cDisavow\u201d links in the Search Console, which is pretty much saying, \u201cHey Google, don\u2019t count this one.\u201d I hope you\u2019ll never have to use it, but if you hire (or have hired) a bad SEO or are being attacked by a competitor, that is how you combat it. Nofollow A link can have a property called \u201cnofollow\u201d such as this: <a href=\u201dhttp://www.somesite.com\u201d title=\u201dkeyword\u201d rel=\u201dnofollow\u201d>Anchor text</a>. If you want to link to somebody but you don\u2019t want it to count as a vote (you don\u2019t want to pass link-juice), or you support user-generated content and want to deter spammers, you can use a nofollow link. Google says it discounts the value of those links. I\u2019m not convinced they discount them heavily, but other SEOs are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else. Redirects If you\u2019re going to change a URL, but you don\u2019t want its link juice to disappear, you can use a 301 redirect. A 301 will pass a majority of the link juice. Canonical URLs If you have two pages that are virtually the same, you can add something like <link rel=\u201dcanonical href=\u201dhttps://www.someurl.com/somepage\u201d> to say \u201chey, treat this page as if it were that page instead, but I don\u2019t want to 301 it.\u201d And with that, we\u2019re ready to build our first links. Link Building Link building is where SEO really starts to matter, and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt. The best way to build links is to not build links. I\u2019ve worked for companies in the past that don\u2019t have to ask for them, they just flow in from press, customer blogs, their awesome blog posts, etc. If this is an option (and we\u2019ll go over a couple of ways to make it more likely) you\u2019re in a great place. If not, at least in the beginning, we\u2019re going to manually create just a few. We\u2019re going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in India to do so. That is a recipe for disaster, and I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve seen that take down a site. Web 2.0s The easiest way to build high quality links are what SEOs call \u201cweb 2.0s.\u201d That\u2019s just a way to say \u201csocial sites\u201d or sites that let you post stuff. Now tweeting a link into the abyss won\u2019t do you anything, but profiles, status pages, etc. do carry some weight. And if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link. Some of the easiest are: Twitter (in your bio) Github (the readme of a repo) YouTube (the description of a video\u200a\u2014\u200ait has to actually get views) Wordpress (yes, you\u2019ll have to actually create a blog) Blogger (same here) Tumblr Upvote-based sites (HackerNews, GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, etc.) If nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links. There are always big lists of \u201cweb 2.0s\u201d you can find online, but keep in mind if you\u2019re going to build something out on a blogging platform you\u2019re going to have to really build something out. That\u2019s a lot of content and time, but you have to do it the right way. We generally keep a bigger list of Web 2.0s here. Some may be out of date, but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen Web 2.0s anyway. Expired Domains Another way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain. This is more difficult to do, but there are a lot of options such as expireddomains.net. (Google \u201cexpired domains\u201d and you\u2019ll find dozens of sites monitoring them.) You\u2019ll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself. Link Intersection Another way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool. These find sites that link to \u201ccompetitor a\u201d and \u201ccompetitor b\u201d but not to you. Theoretically, if they link to both of your competitors, they should be willing to link to you. Moz, Ahrefs, LunaMetrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well. Now that we have a few basic links flowing, we\u2019re going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press, eventually getting to a point where we don\u2019t have to build any more links. Your First Drip of Traffic\u200a\u2014\u200aBecoming an Authority Site Awesome\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have a site that converts well, your SEO is in place, ready for you to drive traffic. Now what? As you\u2019re probably learned at this point, a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic. We\u2019re going to fix that. This section takes a lot of time and effort, and in the beginning you\u2019ll likely wonder if you\u2019re doing anything at all. Remember that class in college that is so difficult it\u2019s the point where most people give up, effectively weeding out the people who aren\u2019t ready to major in a specific subject? Well this is the weeder-out chapter of growth hacking. Take a Long-Term View The reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time\u200a\u2014\u200alosing weight, investing in a 401(k), etc. In the beginning you\u2019re going to have a little seedling of traffic, and you\u2019ll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees, thinking, \u201cI must be doing something wrong.\u201d You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. The traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood. But don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re a startup. Our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable (meaning we won\u2019t die before we start to see the rewards), but at the same time we\u2019re building equity in the Internet. The type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away. We want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years. Combining hundreds (or thousands) of little trickles, our site that converts, and a great product we will create a giant river. Future chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from, so in this chapter we\u2019re going to focus on traffic that\u2019s network-agnostic. Traffic that we can\u2019t get by tapping any specific network. Just to give you some idea of scale, I\u2019ve seen this process drive over 500,000 visits per day, though the build up to that level took almost a full year. What could you do with 500,000 visits per day? Monitoring Alerts To start we\u2019re going to use the keywords we found in the SEO chapter, and inject ourselves (and our company) into the conversation wherever it\u2019s taking place. To do this we\u2019re going to use software called BuzzBundle. BuzzBundle This software lets us do a few things: Disclaimer: This is not the SEO comment spam you\u2019ve\u00a0seen This step takes thought, effort, and a real human who understands what they\u2019re typing. I don\u2019t often say this, but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy. If you\u2019re trying to replicate the automated SEO spam you\u2019ve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work, but you\u2019ll get banned, your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be, and you\u2019ll be banned Productive Commenting We\u2019re not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us SEO traffic. Our comments must do two things: If you do these two things a few changes will take place: First, you\u2019ll notice that people click on your links because you\u2019re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. Second, people will respect your company because you\u2019re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. And with that disclaimer, we\u2019ll move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done. Now that all of that is out of the way, let\u2019s fire up BuzzBundle and get to work. Accounts and\u00a0Personas The first thing you\u2019ll want to do in BuzzBundle is go to Accounts -> Add new accounts. This is the starting point for everything we\u2019ll do, as we need accounts to comment. One thing you\u2019ll notice about BuzzBundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts. I find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view, but I don\u2019t want to go too far overboard and be spammy. I\u2019d recommend doing something simple\u200a\u2014\u200acreate 2\u20133 personas, each of whom you identify with (or are you), and enter them into your BuzzBundle accounts. Personally I don\u2019t even change my name, I just use a different one (eg. Austen J. Allred vs. Austen Allred) or use a few photos, just so it isn\u2019t literally the same name and same photo blanketing the Internet. Disqus Disqus is a comment system used all over the place, and it carries some caveates. Disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post, so there are two workarounds: Both of these work, but the second one is much easier in my view. UTM Parameters Using links with our UTM parameters here will be very beneficial. We\u2019ll be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site, and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic. Link Shorteners If you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted, it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some 301 redirects. To keep it simple you can use a link shortener that 301s such as bit.ly, or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and 301 the traffic from a certain page to your money site. Using BuzzBundle Let\u2019s get started with the BuzzBundle. First, it\u2019s going to ask you for a keyword. We already have a keyword from the SEO section, but we may want to do something even a bit more generic. For this one I\u2019m going to go with \u201cgrowth hacking.\u201d Simply hit \u201cgo\u201d and let BuzzBundle get started. It will load different content types into different columns, but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to. The first thing I clicked on was this: It\u2019s a review of another book about growth hacking. All I had to do was comment, tag the author, ask him if he were willing to review our book, and offer to send him one for free. (If you\u2019re reading this now it\u2019s going to be pretty awkward). My assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic, because it is. The fact that there\u2019s now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus. As an aside, I much prefer to hold \u201cshift\u201d and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if I\u2019m just going to be commenting as myself. The next one I found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week. I left the following comment: Note how I followed him on Twitter so that it\u2019s obviously personal and not an automated spam comment. I even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks. That is how you get people on your team. As you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response, I\u2019d recommend starting to sort by reach, ramping up the number of keywords you\u2019re searching for, and possibly even gasp upgrading to the paid version of BuzzBundle.
