{"name": "1884", "parent": "", "content": "Please Fix The Diversity & Inclusion Loop It Feels\u00a0Broken Give me a time machine and an invisibility cloak and I\u2019ll do it right now. I\u2019ll go back to the first time I considered becoming a software engineer and slap the taste of ambition right out of my mouth. Sure, it\u2019s a bit violent, but the young me needs to know that tech companies won\u2019t make people like me feel like I belong. After picking himself off the floor, Young Kwaku is going to ask why I did that. I\u2019ll have to tell him: \u201cBecause you\u2019re Black, and they don\u2019t really care about\u00a0you\u201d To prevent this raw form of neglect from happening again, we\u2019ve come up with some real ways to solve the problem of diversity in tech. For years, Big Tech Execs have been broadcasting messages through the air waves, stating double-sized intentions to make things change. But from down here, the words sound fake, and the initiatives\u2026 they look completely half-baked. I think \u201cdiverse\u201d as a company flavor would taste pretty good. It\u2019d be a part of every healthy diet, since it makes people smarter. Plus, more inclusive work environments help people of underrepresented groups focus more energy on work, and less on trying to fit in. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have all your Black coworkers at 100% productivity? I bet it would. You know what though, being a woman or person of color in this melting pot of technology can often feel isolating, and equally exhausting, turning any experience into a very vanilla one. Rewind Back to 2013, when I had my first interview with a big tech company. It couldn\u2019t have gone any worse. I failed miserably, and I wasn\u2019t invited back. While the rejection stung, the real trauma came when I noticed that I was the only Black person invited to interview for the position. There were 4 men on the interview panel, 2 White and 2 Asian, none of the more than 20+ candidates were Black, and none of the company employees brought in to speak to us at lunch were Black, Latino, or female. Six months later, after founding my own company, the Bay Area\u2019s diversity problem struck me again. My Co-founders and I, after being accepted into an accelerator program in San Mateo, were given a day to \u201cspeed date\u201d and match with mentors. One round with a particular potential mentor was especially \u201cfun\u201d. To begin the conversation, each of my co-founders shared their background and role on the team. Once it was my turn, I told Mr. Mentor about my degree in Computer Engineering from Cal Poly and my role as the Technical Co-Founder. Fascination was smeared all over his face. But the real paralyzing blow came as soon as he said, \u201cHmm, I never would\u2019ve guessed\u2026\u201d Pause Who do you think you are, Mr. Mentor? What are you talking about, Mr. Mentor? Mr. Mentor, did you really just say that? How Sway? I would\u2019ve liked answers to all these questions, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the experience with anyone, not even my co-founders. I was the only Black person of all the people on the sixteen businesses in our program. Generally, I try to avoid serving any \u201crace talk\u201d to White people\u200a\u2014\u200ait usually ends with a sweet defense of White ignorance, sugared with some good ole idealisms of the USA. And that\u2019s just how it goes when you\u2019re Black in a White place; that\u2019s just another bout with social isolation in the workplace. I never got the chance to figure out what Mr. Mentor meant, but I\u2019ve made my own assumptions. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. I wasn\u2019t sure if Mr. Mentor\u2019s actions were the exception, or the norm. So I decided to leave it be, because I didn\u2019t want to be mistaken; I didn\u2019t want to ruin my team\u2019s chances to succeed as we continued on. Fast Forward Today, the problem of diversity in tech gets much more attention than it did in 2013; however, solutions are slow to develop. The big tech companies are insanely consistent with the reasons why they\u2019re having problems. \u201cWhat actions would you take to fix the diversity problem?\u201d If we asked that question to leaders at companies like Twitter and Microsoft, I genuinely believe that they wouldn\u2019t have an answer, because most of them aren\u2019t Black, aren\u2019t women, and aren\u2019t forced to confront issues of diversity and inclusion head on. But I also genuinely believe that, together, we can come up with solutions that are better than what we\u2019ve currently seen. In recent months I\u2019ve had conversations with diversity recruiters, diversity managers and reps from top tech firms, Black peers, women peers, and mentors; these are the people that have insights that can help solve the problem significantly. The key takeaway from these conversations: the solution needs to cover both diversity and inclusion. Also, it\u2019s not just a pipeline problem, and it\u2019s definitely not a talent problem. DIVERSITY Express Intentions There are a many reasons why a person of color might not apply for a tech job. One reason is imposter syndrome. To counteract this, employers need to express intentions. In the job description, employers should be explicit and state that women and minorities are encouraged to apply. This resonates well with people who fit the description, and it also holds the employer more accountable to make hires that fit. This doesn\u2019t mean an employer has to be biased when making hiring decisions. Make the interview process objective Implicit bias is something that everyone has. Ensuring hiring practices are tailored to prevent implicit bias will help people of color and women avoid being judged for things they can not change. Objective hiring can be accomplished through training. Pinterest, for example, trains their managers to focus less on the candidates name/college on their resume, and focus more on experience and performance. With training, hiring managers will be more able to pinpoint what types of experiences make candidates talented, instead of what college they think does. Lack of diversity in tech is not about lack a talent, it\u2019s about the lack of practice finding it. Recruit from different places How will diversity increase if the schools that these companies use to hire new grads are not diverse? It won\u2019t. Some companies are beginning to recruit from unique areas, such as Google. If potential candidates are always coming from Stanford and UC Berkeley then results will stay the same. It\u2019s not just them though, a lot of good engineering schools have diversity issues, such as Cal Poly, where less than 2% of the student body is African American. Hire for other positions Diversity in tech is not just diversity in software engineering, but diversity in other areas like sales, management, and human resources. It\u2019s frustrating when you walk onto a company\u2019s campus and notice that most of the Black employees at the company are greeting you at the front door. Hiring people from underrepresented groups for roles all throughout a company will close the diversity gap much faster. INCLUSION Affirm Underrepresented Employees Be constructive and positive when telling an employee how they can continue to improve their skills. When justified, point out to the individual that they should consider more opportunities. Many underrepresented minorities in tech don\u2019t feel comfortable raising their hand to ask for a promotion. Let them know that, while it may be a challenge, they are more than capable of taking on the added responsibilities. Understand the effects of privilege Personally, being a Black man means that failing carries more weight than my White colleagues. However, I also understand that my privilege as a man has put me in a better position for success than women. The same goes for education. Knowing what privileges you have and the several types of privilege that exist is important because it produces more empathy. Many times we don\u2019t recognize our own biases towards other people, and that doesn\u2019t help us understand one another\u2019s personal struggles. Recognize all employees as individuals I like music, basketball, food, and cartoons. I\u2019m an individual with my own unique interests. Lack of knowledge about others in the workplace can really affect comfort at work. It was painfully awkward for me the time when someone in my office of fewer than twenty people mistook me for my coworker (who happens to be two shades lighter and six inches taller) and I had to explain that they were thinking about the other Black guy. It\u2019s just as awkward when they realize their mistake and wonder why they made the assumption. Build strategic partnerships with\u00a0CBOs Many people at tech companies are involved with CBOs (Community Based Organizations) outside of their work lives. By getting involved with\u200a\u2014\u200aor even just expressing interest in\u200a\u2014\u200athese programs, employers can appeal to the interests of the employees, and enable the employees to continue getting involved with passion projects. This will also make employees more comfortable expressing themselves at work. Foster collaborative environments It\u2019s hard to know everyone in a big company. But that shouldn\u2019t stop employees from working with one another. I shouldn\u2019t be forced to, nor should I continually, work and interact with the same few people at the office every day. There\u2019s plenty ways to switch this up. Some companies have open seating arrangements, others use a random seating chart to mix things up. This will ultimately lessen the effect of isolation on employees who feel like they don\u2019t fit in. \u201c\u2026 over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant\u201d That quote can be found on Alphabet\u2019s homepage, yet they still seem unwilling to open up a dialog to make lasting changes regarding inclusion of all people in technology. It\u2019s ironic, and it makes me realize that many communities don\u2019t recognize the problem with a lack of diversity, because they\u2019ve already created success without it. Diversity in tech isn\u2019t just a problem for the people of color and women to solve. No. It\u2019s something everyone needs to think about it, and be held accountable for. Otherwise we get things like this\u200a\u2014\u200aand this, and this and this. Lets diversify tech now so we don\u2019t have to see this broken part of history continue to repeat itself.
