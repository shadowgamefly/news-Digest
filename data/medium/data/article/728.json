{"name": "728", "parent": "", "content": "I designed the single-border feature for\u00a0Sketch I started using Sketch two years ago when one of my professors introduced the new software to our class. Since then, I spent more than eight hours a day working with Sketch, and I can only describe myself as a power user. Sketch improves version after version, making designing easier and faster. But there is one feature that I started looking for right from the beginning and that I am still looking for: the one side border. Me adding a border to one side of a rectangle Is it just\u00a0me? While trying to understand how to set a border on one side of a shape, I felt stupid and when I feel stupid I search on Google. So I found two things: that it\u2019s not possible to add a border to a single side, and that I was not alone. Back in 2013 Di\u00f3genes Brito tweeted this question to Sketch: It didn\u2019t take them long to answer: After two long years of silence on this question, Daniel Schwartz asked to Sketch the same question: \u2026 and nope, nothing changed in two years: When Ruben Nine asked this: Sketch seemed to leave the door open to adding this feature in the near future: And Sketch, you know what, it was time in 2016, and it\u2019s definitely time now that it\u2019s 2017! Shadows and their dark\u00a0side There actually is a way to work around the problem: inner shadows. To explain how it works I made a video: I found that many designers are using this trick, the fastest way to avoid the missing one side border feature. But there are some problems with this approach that are hard to ignore: CSS on\u00a0Zeplin 2. When you create two borders with a common corner, one of them will show as being on top of the other: Corners with inner shadows on\u00a0Sketch While with CSS you get this kind of corner: Corners with borders with\u00a0CSS When I need to add a single side border, I use this trick because it gets the job done and it gets it done quick. But it would be amazing to have a specific feature to handle every different border of a shape. How I split borders on\u00a0Sketch My mission as a designer is to make life easier for people and that\u2019s why I designed a new borders panel for Sketch allowing users to manage borders in whichever way they prefer the most. \u201cnormal\u201d borders\u00a0panel In my experience, it is difficult to handle normal and split borders at the same time, so with this solution you can switch from a state to the other using the toggle in the top-right corner. By default the toggle is set to \u201cnormal\u201d, which is the way things are handled on Sketch nowadays. \u201csplit\u201d borders\u00a0panel Switching state from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201csplit\u201d takes you to a brand new panel with four layers, one for each side of the shape (top, right, bottom and left). Here, every side is independent from the others. Corners are now handled like through CSS, and when exporting the code, it will reflect this design. With this new borders feature, you can create outstanding fake 3D shapes that work great. TL;DR What do you think of this project? Which other feature you would like to see on Sketch? You can also find this project on Dribbble\u00a0! If you liked this article feel free to comment and share!
