We\u2019ve complained about it, but have been told we just need to deal. What will making it visible do for us? I\u2019d prefer not to put that ops work on the board. Because then it will be micro-managed, and we will need to explain everything David is not pulling his weight. But I don\u2019t want to be the person to call that out. Plus, management has lost hope in us anyway. They are working around us with that top-secret project. We will never get resources if we make a fuss. So I\u2019ve been asking myself lately: how can we create environments that are safe enough to make continuous improvement possible? How can we make a simple visualization of work less threatening.
