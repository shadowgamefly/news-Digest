{"name": "873", "parent": "", "content": "When Your Partner Has a Tattoo of Their\u00a0Ex It\u2019s a tale as old as time: You fall in love, and all you can think is, I gotta commemorate this moment with a giant permanent tattoo of my lover\u2019s face or name on my body so I never forget. But then you break up, and now you\u2019re a guy with a giant permanent tattoo of your ex\u2019s face or name on your body. Or it happens the other way around: You\u2019ve met someone you really like, and it\u2019s time to get intimate. This is when you notice a name or a face splashed across a chest or bicep, and have to decide how much you care that they have a piece of their past embedded in their skin. There\u2019s no easy answer here. For starters, it\u2019s hard to estimate how many people do this sort of love tattooing, or how it shakes out between men and women. A recent Harris poll found that some three in 10 Americans (and half of millennials) have tattoos. Among the tattooed\u2019s top regrets? Inking the name of someone you\u2019re longer with. The anecdotes from people wrestling with a new partner\u2019s tattoo of an ex seem to be overwhelmingly women complaining about men who, for whatever reason, choose to keep a permanent visual roster of their past lovers. The internet is filled with forums and columns where advice-seekers need backup on this issue: Am I supposed to care about this dude\u2019s tattoo of his baby mama? Is he supposed to fix it out of respect to us? Or is it no big deal? The letters are strikingly identical, give or take a few details. A 29-year-old woman asks Washington Post advice columnist Carolyn Hax about how to deal with the tattoo of her 37-year-old divorced boyfriend\u2019s ex-wife on his bicep. They\u2019ve been dating a month, but already she can\u2019t take this thing. She writes: From what I understand, they were married 10 years ago and he doesn\u2019t speak to her, but I kinda feel like I need to know at least part of the story. I also feel like it will come out naturally and that if I press, it will undo the excellent foundation we\u2019ve laid. I\u2019m so happy the way things are, I really don\u2019t want to rock the boat, but that tattoo\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201cIs this petty?\u201d another woman asks the site Madame Noire. \u201cHe won\u2019t get the tattoo of his ex\u2019s name covered up.\u201d Here, the boyfriend\u200a\u2014\u200awhom advice-seeker Kam has been seeing seven months\u200a\u2014\u200ahas his ex\u2019s and (baby mama\u2019s) name in \u201cgaudy cursive\u201d on his arm. \u201cKam has tried not to let the tattoo bother her, but she says that when they have sex, it\u2019s always there in her face. And when she notices it, in and out of bed, she\u2019s immediately turned off,\u201d Victoria Uwumarogie writes. Men also query the internet on what to do about finding out a new girlfriend has a tattoo of her ex. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve started dating this new girlfriend,\u201d a guy asks on the forum Mixed Martial Arts. \u201cYou like her enough to go on a few dates before having sex, and when you finally get to do the dirty with her, you discover she has a tattoo of her ex boyfriends name. She tells you that ex was the love of her life and that he died while they were still together, and while not yet married, had plans to spend their entire lives together. She has no intentions of ever having it removed. Do you shut up and deal with it or do you bail?\u201d The advice given in all scenarios boils down to four main options. You ask them to cover it up; you ask or hope that they add you to the roster; you get over it; or you don\u2019t date this person (a lot of people think those who get tattoos of lovers are bad news in the first place). Let\u2019s say you can\u2019t just get over it, but you want to stay in the relationship. Covering the tat seems like a good choice. Our best go-to in this, and so many life choices, is obviously Johnny Depp, who famously altered his \u201cWinona Forever\u201d tattoo to \u201cWino Forever\u201d after he and Ryder split. Somehow he went ahead and got another tattoo when he fell in love with Amber Heard\u200a\u2014\u200athe word \u201cSlim\u201d (Heard\u2019s nickname) on his knuckles, and a tattoo of her head on his bicep. When they crashed and burned last year, he changed \u201cSlim\u201d to \u201cScum\u201d and has covered up her likeness with a blackout tattoo, according to US Weekly. Covering the tattoos seems to have been Depp\u2019s own call, not something he did at the request of a new lover\u200a\u2014\u200aso unless a partner decides to get rid of the evidence of their own accord, the real work of convincing or putting up with it will fall on the next partner. There\u2019s a distinct queasiness to the issue, because it\u2019s not only about whether tattoos of lovers past are bad; we also wonder what it says about someone who needs to declare their love in this way. It\u2019s also about jealousy. We all know we\u2019re the product of all the previous relationships we\u2019ve had, but most of us don\u2019t go carrying them around with us so literally\u200a\u2014\u200aforcing other people to re-read their name or gaze upon their faces over and over and over. Exes are hard enough to deal with in real life, and we may all have an old box full of pictures of our high school boyfriend or girlfriend somewhere in a closet. But who wants a visual reminder you can never escape? Nothing says someone is not really out of the picture like having to look at a literal picture of them on your lover\u2019s body. Perhaps the best perspective is from tattoo artists themselves. Last year, New York magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Cut\u201d interviewed tattoo artist-to-the-stars Scott Campbell, asking him specifically about getting the tattoos of old lovers removed. He admitted to covering up or removing tattoos of some of his exes, but not all, and he doesn\u2019t necessarily advocate for it. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an honesty in it. If it made my wife uncomfortable, I would. Tattoos take away the luxury of denial. We all have exes and people who broke our hearts and people whose hearts we broke. It forces you to accept it and understand it and understand the things that happened before now.\u201d Tracy Moore is a staff writer at MEL.
