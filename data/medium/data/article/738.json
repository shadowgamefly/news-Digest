My knowledge about technology was limited. In meetings I would keep hearing these words, but had no clue what they meant. I\u2019d get back to my desk and google what I\u2019d heard, hoping no one would spot me! Overtime, I found there were lots of people new in tech having the same issues. I decided to compile an A-Z list of tech words with explanations in plain English. \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201d (Albert Einstein) A/B testing A/B testing is a when you test two different versions of online content with users to see which one they prefer. Agile Agile development is a technique for incremental software development. It is an umbrella term for several different types of methodologies. It focuses on keeping code simple, testing often, and delivering functional parts of the application as soon as they\u2019re ready. Android Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It comes installed on a range of mobile phone and tablets. API This stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is how computers and web applications share information with each other. An example: an app finds the current weather in Sydney by sending a message to the weather.com API. The weather.com API then replies with a structured response. Automation Testing Automation Testing is when a QA uses an automation tool to do tests on a software application. Avatar \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa4 An avatar is the embodiment of a person or idea. In the computer world, an avatar refers to a character that represents an online user.

Every time you reach a good stopping point, you pull out your camera and take a picture. Once the airplane is complete, you can go back through your photos, and see how it looked at various stages. Your software project is like the model airplane. Each photo you took of the model airplane is a commit. CSS CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen. HTML is the structure, CSS is the style and Javascript is the behaviour. Dev Ops Dev Ops focuses on fast technology delivery through the use of agile development. Dev Ops focuses on people and culture.

Hack Day/Hackathon This is when the digital team take a day or more out, to come up with innovative ideas. The aim of a hack day is to encourage creativity to get people to think outside the box.

You see two ways to do it, one is quick to do but messy. It\u2019ll make further changes harder in the future. The other results in a cleaner design, but will take longer to put in place. (example from Agile Web Operations). Tech Debt is the extra time it will take to do the better option, having done the messy option. Unit Testing Unit testing is where parts of an application are tested to find out if they are good to use. Unit testing can be done manually but is often automated. VPN Virtual Private Network. A VPN allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. Waterfall In software development the Waterfall Model is when each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. Unlike agile which is a technique for incremental software development. \u201cThere is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the ambiguity of words\u201d Thomas\u00a0Reid Bookmark this A-Z \u2606 and use it as a reference.
