Follow Backchannel: Facebook |\u00a0Twitter Google Book Search is amazing that way. When it started almost 15 years ago, it also seemed impossibly ambitious: An upstart tech company that had just tamed and organized the vast informational jungle of the web would now extend the reach of its search box into the offline world. By scanning millions of printed books from the libraries with which it partnered, it would import the entire body of pre-internet writing into its database. \u201cYou have thousands of years of human knowledge, and probably the highest-quality knowledge is captured in books,\u201d Google cofounder Sergey Brin told The New Yorker at the time. \u201cSo not having that\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just too big an omission.\u201d Today, Google is known for its moonshot culture, its willingness to take on gigantic challenges at global scale.

In its youth, Google Books inspired the world with a vision of a \u201clibrary of utopia\u201d that would extend online convenience to offline wisdom. At the time it seemed like a singularity for the written word: We\u2019d upload all those pages into the ether, and they would somehow produce a phase-shift in human awareness. Instead, Google Books has settled into a quiet middle age of sourcing quotes and serving up snippets of text from the 25 million-plus tomes in its database. Google employees maintain that\u2019s all they ever intended to achieve. Maybe so. But they sure got everyone else\u2019s hopes up. Two things happened to Google Books on the way from moonshot vision to mundane reality.

A decade-long legal battle followed\u200a\u2014\u200aone that finally ended last year, when the US Supreme Court turned down an appeal by the Authors Guild and definitively lifted the legal cloud that had so long hovered over Google\u2019s book-related ambitions. But in that time, another change had come over Google Books, one that\u2019s not all that unusual for institutions and people who get caught up in decade-long legal battles: It lost its drive and ambition. When I started work on this story, I feared at first that Books no longer existed as a discrete part of the Google organization\u200a\u2014\u200athat Google had actually shut the project down. As with many aspects of Google, there\u2019s always been some secrecy around Google Books, but this time, when I started asking questions, it closed up like a startled turtle. For weeks there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone around or available who could or would speak to the current state of the Books effort. The Google Books \u201cHistory\u201d page trails off in 2007, and its blog stopped updating in 2012, after which it got folded into the main Google Search blog, where information about Books is nearly impossible to find. As a functioning and useful service, Google Books remained a going concern. But as a living project, with plans and announcements and institutional visibility, it seemed to have pulled a vanishing act. All of which felt weird, given the legal victory it had finally won. When I talked to alumni of the project who\u2019d left Google, several mentioned that they suspected the company had stopped scanning books. Eventually, I learned that there are, indeed, still some Googlers working on Book Search, and they\u2019re still adding new books, though at a significantly slower pace than at the project\u2019s peak around 2010\u201311. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on shiny features and things that are very visible to users,\u201d says Stephane Jaskiewicz, a Google engineer who has worked on Books for a decade and now leads its team. \u201cIt\u2019s more like behind the scenes work and perfecting the technology\u200a\u2014\u200aacquiring content, processing it properly so that we can view the entire book online, and adjusting the search algorithm.\u201d One focus of work has been a constant throughout Google Books\u2019 life: improving the scanners that add new books to the \u201ccorpus,\u201d as the database is known. At the birth of the project, in 2002, as Larry Page and Marissa Mayer set out to gauge how long it might take to Scan All The Books, they set up a digital camera on a stand and timed themselves with a metronome. Once the company got serious about ramping its scanning up to efficient scale, it started jealously guarding details of the operation. Jaskiewicz does say that the scanning stations keep evolving, with new revisions rolling out every six months. LED lighting, not widely available at the project\u2019s start, has helped. So has studying more efficient techniques for human operators to flip pages. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like finger-picking on a guitar,\u201d Jaskiewicz says. \u201cSo we find people who have great ways of turning pages\u200a\u2014\u200awhere is the thumb and that kind of stuff.\u201d Still, the bulk of the work at Google Books continues to be on \u201csearch quality\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amaking sure that you find the Kafka passage you need, fast. It\u2019s an unglamorous game of inches\u200a\u2014\u200aless moonshot and more, say, satellite maintenance. To understand how Google Books arrived at this point, you need to know a few things about copyright law, which essentially divides books into three classes. Some books are in the public domain, which means you can do what you want with their texts\u200a\u2014\u200amostly, those published before 1923, as well as more recent books whose authors chose to release them from standard copyright. Plenty of more recent books are still in print and under copyright; if you want to do anything with these texts, you have to come to terms with their authors and publishers. Then there\u2019s the third category: books that are out of print but still under copyright, known informally as \u201corphan works.\u201d It turns out there are a whole lot of these\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cbetween 17 percent and 25 percent of published works and as much as 70 percent of specialized collections,\u201d a study by the US Copyright Office suggests. How many books is that? No one knows for sure because no one can say with any certainty exactly how many total books there are. The statistic depends on how you define \u201cbook,\u201d which isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. In 2010 a Google engineer named Leonid Taycher wrote a blog post that examined Google Books\u2019 metadata and concluded that the number (then) was about 130 million. Others looked at this work and called it \u201cbunk.\u201d The actual number is probably somewhat lower than Taycher\u2019s figure yet considerably higher than Google Books\u2019 current 25 million-plus. Some large chunk of that large number, then, are \u201corphan works.\u201d And until recently, they weren\u2019t much of an issue. You could borrow them from a library or find them in a used bookstore, and that was that. But once Google Books proposed to scan them all and make them available to the internet, everyone seemed to want a piece of them. The legal battle that ensued was, essentially, a custody fight over these orphans, in which Google, publishers, and authors each sought to control the process of ushering them into a new home for the digital age. The three parties eventually agreed on a grand compromise known as the Google Books Settlement, under which Google would go ahead and make the orphan works available in their entirety and set aside money to compensate rights holders who stepped forward. But in 2011, a federal judge rejected the settlement, ruling in favor of advocates who feared it would forever ensconce a private for-profit company as the registrar and toll collector of the universe\u2019s library. Once the settlement collapsed, Google went back to its scanning, and publishers pursued the burgeoning business of selling e-books, which had leapfrogged Google\u2019s lead in the future-of-books race due to the success of Amazon\u2019s Kindle. But the Authors Guild continued to press its lawsuit, charging that Google\u2019s arrogation of the right to scan and index books without the permission of copyright holders was illegal. Google is wealthy, but not so wealthy that it could ignore the threat of multi-billion dollar copyright infringement penalties (thousands of dollars per book for millions of books). This was the proceeding that dragged on until the Supreme Court put it out of its misery last year\u200a\u2014\u200aestablishing once and for all that Google had a fair-use right to catalogue books and provide brief excerpts (\u201csnippets\u201d) in search results, just as it did with web pages. That ruling represents a foundational achievement for the future of online research\u2014Google\u2019s and everyone else\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s now established precedent\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone benefits,\u201d says Erin Simon, Google Books\u2019 product counsel today. \u201cThis is going to be in textbooks. It\u2019s supremely important for understanding what fair use means.\u201d (Simon also notes with a chuckle that when the suit was originally filed, she hadn\u2019t yet started law school.) The Authors Guild may have lost in court, but it believes the fight was worth it. Google \u201cdid it wrong from the beginning,\u201d says James Gleick, president of the Guild\u2019s board. \u201cThey plowed ahead without involving the creative community on whose backs they were building this new thing. The big companies have a droit du seigneur attitude toward creative work. They think, \u2018We are the masters of the universe now.\u2019 They should have just licensed the books instead.\u201d You\u2019d think a Supreme Court victory would have meant a renewal of energy for Google Books: Rev up the scanners\u200a\u2014\u200afull speed ahead! By all the evidence, that has not been the case. Partly that\u2019s because the database is so huge already. \u201cWe have a fixed budget that we\u2019re spending,\u201d says Jaskiewicz. \u201cAt the beginning, we were scanning everything on every shelf. At some point we started getting a lot of duplicates.\u201d Today Google gives its partner libraries \u201cpick lists\u201d instead. There are plenty of other explanations for the dampening of Google\u2019s ardor: The bad taste left from the lawsuits. The rise of shiny and exciting new ventures with more immediate payoffs. And also: the dawning realization that Scanning All The Books, however useful, might not change the world in any fundamental way. To many bibliophiles, Google\u2019s self-appointment as universal librarian never made sense: That role properly belonged to some public institution. Once Google popularized the notion that Scanning All The Books was a feasible undertaking, others lined up to tackle it. Brewster Kahle\u2019s Internet Archive, which stores historical snapshots of the whole web, already had its own scanning operation. The Digital Public Library of America grew out of meetings at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Center beginning in 2010 and now serves as a clearinghouse and consortium for the digital collections of many libraries and institutions. When Google partnered with university libraries to scan their collections, it had agreed to give them each a copy of the scanning data, and in 2008 the HathiTrust began organizing and sharing those files. (It had to fend off the Authors Guild in court, too.) HathiTrust has 125 member organizations and institutions who \u201cbelieve that we can better steward research and cultural heritage by working together than alone or by leaving it to an organization like Google,\u201d says Mike Furlough, the trust\u2019s director. And of course there\u2019s the Library of Congress itself, whose new leader, Carla Hayden, has committed to opening up public access to its collections through digitization. In a sense each of these outfits is a competitor to Google Books. But in reality, Google is so far ahead that none of them is likely to catch up. The consensus among observers is that it cost Google several hundred million dollars to build Google Books, and nobody else is going to spend that kind of money to perform the feat a second time. Still, the nonprofits have a strength Google lacks: They\u2019re not subject to the changing priorities of a gigantic technology corporation. They have a focused commitment around books, unencumbered by distractions like running one of the largest advertising businesses in the world or managing a smartphone ecosystem. Unlike Google, they\u2019re not going to lose interest in seeking new ways to connect readers with books that might, a la Kafka, melt a frozen mind. In popular mythology, interminable lawsuits turn into hungry maelstroms that drown the participants. (The archetype is Dickens\u2019 Jarndyce v. Jarndyce from Bleak House, the generations-spanning estate fight whose legal fees eat up all the assets at stake.) In the tech business, court battles like the celebrated antitrust suit that plagued IBM for years tend to pinion giant corporations and provide new competitors with an opening to lap an incumbent. Google itself rose to dominate search while Microsoft was busy defending itself from the Justice Department. Yet the Books fight was never as central to Google\u2019s corporate being as that kind of all-consuming conflict. And it wasn\u2019t all a waste, either. It taught Google something valuable. As the Authors Guild\u2019s Gleick points out, Google started Books with a \u201cbetter ask forgiveness than permission\u201d attitude that\u2019s common today in the world of startups. In a sense, the company behaved like the Uber of intellectual property\u200a\u2014\u200aa kind of read-sharing service\u200a\u2014\u200awhile expecting to be seen the way it saw itself, as a beneficent pantheon of wizards serving the entire human species. It was naive, and the stubborn opposition it aroused came as a shock. But Google took away a lesson that helped it immeasurably as it grew and gained power: Engineering is great, but it\u2019s not the answer to all problems. Sometimes you have to play politics, too\u200a\u2014\u200aconsult stakeholders, line up allies, compromise with rivals. As a result, Google assembled a crew of lobbyists and lawyers and approached other similar challenges\u200a\u2014\u200alike navigating YouTube\u2019s rights maze\u200a\u2014\u200awith greater care and better results. It grew up. It came to understand that it could shoot for the moon, but it wouldn\u2019t always get there. It\u2019s possible that Google might someday take another run at solving the orphan works problem. But it looks like it\u2019s going to wait for others to take the lead. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything that we could do without a different legal framework,\u201d says Jaskiewicz. As I worked on this piece, I kept thinking back to a book I\u2019d read a few years ago called Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore, a whimsical, nerdy novel by Robin Sloan. It\u2019s about a secret society dedicated to solving a centuries-old Name of the Rose-style mystery that\u2019s rooted in bookmaking and typography. Google plays a critical supporting role in Penumbra, as the protagonist attempts to unravel the riddle at the story\u2019s heart. As it turns out, even the company\u2019s unrivaled informational prowess isn\u2019t enough to do the trick. That takes a chance encounter between the protagonist and a particular book that provides an illuminating insight. It takes, in the phrase with which Sloan closes his tale, \u201cexactly the right book, at exactly the right time.\u201d Penumbra reminds us that Google\u2019s engineering mindset isn\u2019t omnipotent. Breaking a challenge into approachable pieces, turning it into data, and applying efficient routines is a powerful way to work. It can carry you a good distance toward a \u201clibrary of utopia,\u201d but it won\u2019t get you there. And even if you get there, it isn\u2019t utopia, anyway. The hard labor is still ahead. That\u2019s because when you turn a book into data, you make it easy to find quotes and search snippets, but you don\u2019t make it fundamentally easier to do the work of reading the book\u200a\u2014\u200athat irreplaceable experience of allowing one\u2019s own mind to be temporarily inhabited by the voice of another person. To date, the full experience of reading a book requires human beings at both ends. An index like Google Books helps us find and analyze texts but, so far, making use of them is still our job. Maybe the quest to digitize all books was bound to end in disappointment, with no grand epiphany. Like many tech-friendly bibliophiles, Sloan says he uses Google Books a lot, but is sad that it isn\u2019t continuing to evolve and amaze us. \u201cI wish it was a big glittering beautiful useful thing that was growing and getting more interesting all the time,\u201d he says. He also wonders: We know Google can\u2019t legally make its millions of books available for anyone to read in full\u200a\u2014\u200abut what if it made them available for machines to read? Machine-learning tools that analyze texts in new ways are advancing quickly today, Sloan notes, and \u201cthe culture around it has a real Homebrew Computer Club or early web feel to it right now.\u201d But to progress, researchers need big troves of data to feed their programs. \u201cIf Google could find a way to take that corpus, sliced and diced by genre, topic, time period, all the ways you can divide it, and make that available to machine-learning researchers and hobbyists at universities and out in the wild, I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s some really interesting work that could come out of that. Nobody knows what,\u201d Sloan says. He assumes Google is already doing this internally. Jaskiewicz and others at Google would not say. Maybe, when some neural network of the future achieves self-awareness and find itself paralyzed by Kafka-esque existential doubts, it will find solace, as so many of us do, in finding exactly the right book to shatter its psychic ice. Or maybe, unlike us, it will be able to read all the books we\u2019ve scanned\u200a\u2014\u200areally read them, in a way that makes sense of them. What would it do then?

This was the proceeding that dragged on until the Supreme Court put it out of its misery last year\u200a\u2014\u200aestablishing once and for all that Google had a fair-use right to catalogue books and provide brief excerpts (\u201csnippets\u201d) in search results, just as it did with web pages."}, {"d7d6": "That ruling represents a foundational achievement for the future of online research\u2014Google\u2019s and everyone else\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s now established precedent\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone benefits,\u201d says Erin Simon, Google Books\u2019 product counsel today. \u201cThis is going to be in textbooks. It\u2019s supremely important for understanding what fair use means.\u201d (Simon also notes with a chuckle that when the suit was originally filed, she hadn\u2019t yet started law school.)"}, {"1475": "The Authors Guild may have lost in court, but it believes the fight was worth it. Google \u201cdid it wrong from the beginning,\u201d says James Gleick, president of the Guild\u2019s board. \u201cThey plowed ahead without involving the creative community on whose backs they were building this new thing. The big companies have a droit du seigneur attitude toward creative work. They think, \u2018We are the masters of the universe now.\u2019 They should have just licensed the books instead.\u201d"}, {"d46f": "You\u2019d think a Supreme Court victory would have meant a renewal of energy for Google Books: Rev up the scanners\u200a\u2014\u200afull speed ahead! By all the evidence, that has not been the case. Partly that\u2019s because the database is so huge already. \u201cWe have a fixed budget that we\u2019re spending,\u201d says Jaskiewicz. \u201cAt the beginning, we were scanning everything on every shelf. At some point we started getting a lot of duplicates.\u201d Today Google gives its partner libraries \u201cpick lists\u201d instead."}, {"e2ad": "There are plenty of other explanations for the dampening of Google\u2019s ardor: The bad taste left from the lawsuits. The rise of shiny and exciting new ventures with more immediate payoffs. And also: the dawning realization that Scanning All The Books, however useful, might not change the world in any fundamental way."}, {"29de": "To many bibliophiles, Google\u2019s self-appointment as universal librarian never made sense: That role properly belonged to some public institution. Once Google popularized the notion that Scanning All The Books was a feasible undertaking, others lined up to tackle it. Brewster Kahle\u2019s Internet Archive, which stores historical snapshots of the whole web, already had its own scanning operation. The Digital Public Library of America grew out of meetings at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Center beginning in 2010 and now serves as a clearinghouse and consortium for the digital collections of many libraries and institutions."}, {"fcd1": "When Google partnered with university libraries to scan their collections, it had agreed to give them each a copy of the scanning data, and in 2008 the HathiTrust began organizing and sharing those files. (It had to fend off the Authors Guild in court, too.) HathiTrust has 125 member organizations and institutions who \u201cbelieve that we can better steward research and cultural heritage by working together than alone or by leaving it to an organization like Google,\u201d says Mike Furlough, the trust\u2019s director. And of course there\u2019s the Library of Congress itself, whose new leader, Carla Hayden, has committed to opening up public access to its collections through digitization."}, {"8c57": "In a sense each of these outfits is a competitor to Google Books. But in reality, Google is so far ahead that none of them is likely to catch up. The consensus among observers is that it cost Google several hundred million dollars to build Google Books, and nobody else is going to spend that kind of money to perform the feat a second time."}, {"9d5c": "Still, the nonprofits have a strength Google lacks: They\u2019re not subject to the changing priorities of a gigantic technology corporation. They have a focused commitment around books, unencumbered by distractions like running one of the largest advertising businesses in the world or managing a smartphone ecosystem. Unlike Google, they\u2019re not going to lose interest in seeking new ways to connect readers with books that might, a la Kafka, melt a frozen mind."}, {"ce5c": "In popular mythology, interminable lawsuits turn into hungry maelstroms that drown the participants. (The archetype is Dickens\u2019 Jarndyce v. Jarndyce from Bleak House, the generations-spanning estate fight whose legal fees eat up all the assets at stake.) In the tech business, court battles like the celebrated antitrust suit that plagued IBM for years tend to pinion giant corporations and provide new competitors with an opening to lap an incumbent. Google itself rose to dominate search while Microsoft was busy defending itself from the Justice Department."}, {"c7a8": "Yet the Books fight was never as central to Google\u2019s corporate being as that kind of all-consuming conflict. And it wasn\u2019t all a waste, either. It taught Google something valuable."}, {"de09": "As the Authors Guild\u2019s Gleick points out, Google started Books with a \u201cbetter ask forgiveness than permission\u201d attitude that\u2019s common today in the world of startups. In a sense, the company behaved like the Uber of intellectual property\u200a\u2014\u200aa kind of read-sharing service\u200a\u2014\u200awhile expecting to be seen the way it saw itself, as a beneficent pantheon of wizards serving the entire human species. It was naive, and the stubborn opposition it aroused came as a shock."}, {"d653": "But Google took away a lesson that helped it immeasurably as it grew and gained power: Engineering is great, but it\u2019s not the answer to all problems. Sometimes you have to play politics, too\u200a\u2014\u200aconsult stakeholders, line up allies, compromise with rivals. As a result, Google assembled a crew of lobbyists and lawyers and approached other similar challenges\u200a\u2014\u200alike navigating YouTube\u2019s rights maze\u200a\u2014\u200awith greater care and better results.

But it looks like it\u2019s going to wait for others to take the lead. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything that we could do without a different legal framework,\u201d says Jaskiewicz."}, {"b366": "As I worked on this piece, I kept thinking back to a book I\u2019d read a few years ago called Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore, a whimsical, nerdy novel by Robin Sloan. It\u2019s about a secret society dedicated to solving a centuries-old Name of the Rose-style mystery that\u2019s rooted in bookmaking and typography. Google plays a critical supporting role in Penumbra, as the protagonist attempts to unravel the riddle at the story\u2019s heart. As it turns out, even the company\u2019s unrivaled informational prowess isn\u2019t enough to do the trick. That takes a chance encounter between the protagonist and a particular book that provides an illuminating insight. It takes, in the phrase with which Sloan closes his tale, \u201cexactly the right book, at exactly the right time.\u201d"}, {"875a": "Penumbra reminds us that Google\u2019s engineering mindset isn\u2019t omnipotent.

The hard labor is still ahead. That\u2019s because when you turn a book into data, you make it easy to find quotes and search snippets, but you don\u2019t make it fundamentally easier to do the work of reading the book\u200a\u2014\u200athat irreplaceable experience of allowing one\u2019s own mind to be temporarily inhabited by the voice of another person."}, {"82d8": "To date, the full experience of reading a book requires human beings at both ends. An index like Google Books helps us find and analyze texts but, so far, making use of them is still our job. Maybe the quest to digitize all books was bound to end in disappointment, with no grand epiphany."}, {"1429": "Like many tech-friendly bibliophiles, Sloan says he uses Google Books a lot, but is sad that it isn\u2019t continuing to evolve and amaze us. \u201cI wish it was a big glittering beautiful useful thing that was growing and getting more interesting all the time,\u201d he says. He also wonders: We know Google can\u2019t legally make its millions of books available for anyone to read in full\u200a\u2014\u200abut what if it made them available for machines to read?"}, {"8f81": "Machine-learning tools that analyze texts in new ways are advancing quickly today, Sloan notes, and \u201cthe culture around it has a real Homebrew Computer Club or early web feel to it right now.\u201d But to progress, researchers need big troves of data to feed their programs."}, {"f1fc": "\u201cIf Google could find a way to take that corpus, sliced and diced by genre, topic, time period, all the ways you can divide it, and make that available to machine-learning researchers and hobbyists at universities and out in the wild, I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s some really interesting work that could come out of that. Nobody knows what,\u201d Sloan says. He assumes Google is already doing this internally. Jaskiewicz and others at Google would not say."}, {"8330": "Maybe, when some neural network of the future achieves self-awareness and find itself paralyzed by Kafka-esque existential doubts, it will find solace, as so many of us do, in finding exactly the right book to shatter its psychic ice.
