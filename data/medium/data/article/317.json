{"name": "317", "parent": "", "content": "Stop Chasing Opportunities Do you believe that more opportunities equal more chances of success? I sure did. And since we all want to feel important in this world, we think that the way to achieve that is to chase every single opportunity out there. I hear it often: \u201cThis is a big opportunity for me.\u201d But that idea is broken. Chasing opportunities is a bad strategy. It\u2019s more practical to chase skills, and PREPARE for opportunities. That\u2019s a small tweak in your mindset, but it changes everything. Abraham Lincoln put it best: \u201cI will prepare and some day my chance will\u00a0come.\u201d We\u2019re always desperately looking for the next big opportunity. The next big business idea, technology to adopt, holiday to plan, house to buy, person to seduce, promotion to acquire. What are you pursuing in your\u00a0life? Are you all over the place? Trying to make the best of everything? Chasing every single opportunity on your path? If you do that, this is you: Many opportunities. You\u2019re just fooling yourself. You want it all, but you lack the courage to say no. So you say yes, and you put yourself in an impossible situation. Many priorities equal NO\u00a0focus I must be honest\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m talking to myself here. For most of my life, I\u2019ve been moving from one opportunity to the other. That changed about two years ago when I decided to only focus on growing Vartex, my family business, and my blog. And that went well. I said no to everything else. But I was tempted by opportunities the last few months. Consulting, coaching, speaking, writing more books, starting other businesses, creating YouTube videos\u200a\u2014\u200athings I either did or considered. But all it did was confuse me. I had too many priorities and zero focus. It was time for me to rethink my opportunities. However, it\u2019s never a matter of finding opportunities. Everyone has opportunities. So it\u2019s not about how many opportunities you have, it\u2019s about how many opportunities you eliminate from your life. And that\u2019s not easy. I decided to only focus on my business, blog, online courses, and podcasting. Just four things. They\u2019re all very closely related. And I say no to every other opportunity. Opportunities are not only\u00a0external Most opportunities come from within. Every time you think: \u201cShould I pursue this?\u201d You\u2019re evaluating an opportunity. And that requires a lot of brainpower. So make your life easy, and DECIDE. Decide what you want to focus on in your career. What do you want to excel at? And do exactly that. Nothing else. \u201cHow many things should I focus\u00a0on?\u201d That\u2019s a tough one. It depends on where you are in life. In the beginning of your career, I would pick one to make things easy. Just pick one skill and give it all your attention. But having just one skill in life will not get you far. When I look at people who are doing well in life, they often have combined several skills to get a competitive advantage. You also don\u2019t want to be a jack of all trades. Otherwise, you\u2019re okay at many things, but never exceptional at a few. \u201cHow do I know when opportunity knocks?\u201d When you know that it requires hard work to actualize the opportunity. Thomas Edison put it nicely: \u201cOpportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like\u00a0work.\u201d At the end of the day, an opportunity is just a chance of making something good happen. An opportunity alone means nothing. Give ten people the same opportunity, and you\u2019ll get ten different outcomes. Opportunity = More Work (which is not always a good thing) Because you don\u2019t want to work yourself to death, it\u2019s best to pick your opportunities wisely. How? I ask myself two questions. And when you answer those questions honestly, you always get a handful of career opportunities. No one is good at 107 skills. And no one enjoys doing everything in the world. Remember that drawing from earlier? You\u2019re chasing all opportunities, but you end up confused. Now, when you decide to pursue a few good opportunities that knock on your door, you get this: A few opportunities. Look, life is full of opportunity. You just have to figure out which opportunities you\u2019re going after. And yes, that\u2019s a hard thing to figure out. You also don\u2019t control the opportunities that come your way. What do you control? How prepared you are. So stop chasing everything like a happy dog in the park on a summer day. Just keep things simple, work on your skills, character, and become better at a few things every single day. And when opportunity knocks, don\u2019t be afraid of the work, grab it by the head and give it EVERYTHING YOU GOT. Thanks for reading! This article was originally published on dariusforoux.com.
