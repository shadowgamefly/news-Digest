{"name": "427", "parent": "", "content": "Tech\u2019s Harassment Crisis Now Has an Arsenal of Smoking\u00a0Guns Four years after #Donglegate, we\u2019re finally ready to believe\u00a0women. Last year, Stefanie Johnson gathered 31 women to talk about how being attractive influences their experience at work. Johnson, a professor who studies unconscious bias at the University of Colorado Boulder, was especially interested in women who worked in masculine fields\u2014like tech and academia. She expected to hear stories about condescending meetings and microaggressions. Instead, the women began spontaneously unleashing story after story about sexual harassment at work. Everyone had an experience, it seemed, and no one knew what to do about it. What they did know was that they definitely weren\u2019t going to lodge a complaint. \u201cMost of the women seemed pretty shocked at the idea of reporting it,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cThey would tell me, \u2018That\u2019s insane, why would you bother to report it? That\u2019s career suicide.\u2019\u201d Follow Backchannel: Facebook |\u00a0Twitter Given that the high-powered women of Johnson\u2019s study agreed that the best strategy was shutting up, the recent drumbeat of women reporting sexual harassment suggests that something new is in the air. In February, an epic post by Susan Fowler chronicled the repeated sexual harassment she endured while working as an engineer at Uber. Soon, more former Uber employees were coming forward with similarly horrifying stories. Then reporters unearthed a Tesla lawsuit in which a female engineer told a now-familiar tale of harassment. And the problems aren\u2019t only the result of men: Earlier this week, New York Magazine reported that an employee of the period-underwear startup Thinx is filing a complaint against founder Miki Agrawal, alleging that she bred a culture of fear and sexual harassment. These anecdotes paint a picture of a work culture run amok, with standards of acceptable behavior badly warped. But there\u2019s another way of looking at this trend as a sign of progress. We are at last unearthing the dark commonalities of women\u2019s experiences in Silicon Valley. As these women have gone public, they\u2019re reaching what appears to be a receptive audience. Their audiences are angry, and ready to take action. That hasn\u2019t always been true. Just four years ago, the tech world bore witness to just how how ugly blowback can be and how quickly public response can spiral out of control. As it turns out, advancing public debate around social issues\u2014whether in Silicon Valley or anywhere else\u200a\u2014\u200ais never just about speaking out. It takes the perfect timing, and the perfect case. Adria Richards was sitting in a ballroom at PyCon, a coding conference in Santa Clara, CA. Behind her, she overheard two men trading jokes. They were speaking loudly, she later wrote, and making sexual jokes using coder lingo: \u201cI\u2019d fork his repo\u201d and \u201cbig dongle.\u201d It was offensive, and it made her feel uncomfortable. So she reported them to the conference via Twitter: Conference staff pulled the two men aside and talked to them. They left PyCon miffed. Then a few days later, one of the men, posting under the pseudonym \u201cHank,\u201d popped up on Hacker News with a complaint. The tweet, he wrote, had gotten him fired. He was upset with Richards. She had every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position. [But] as a result of the picture she took I was let go from my job today. Which sucks because I have three kids and I really liked that job. She gave me no warning, she smiled while she snapped the pic and sealed my fate.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame Richards, in other words\u2014but it would be just fine with him if others did. That post launched an angry backlash against Richards. The opinions varied. In a post at Ars Technica, Ken Fischer called her response \u201ca classic overreaction.\u201d A surge of trolls threatened her, calling her names and ordering her off her feed. On 4Chan, hackers planned and launched a DDoS attack against Richards\u2019s employer, SendGrid. The attack would only stop, they wrote, once SendGrid fired her. Soon, the company complied. Richards was out of a job. In a statement, SendGrid CEO Jim Franklin said that the company supported Richards\u2019s right to see harassment and call it out. They supported her feelings. They did not, however, like her vehicle. \u201cWhat we do not support is how she reported the conduct,\u201d the statement read. For months after her tweet, Richards couch-surfed. She was scared to stay in one place because she\u2019d been doxxed and her address was all over the internet. Her feeds were filled with threats and images of her beheaded, or her face photoshopped onto the body of porn stars. I\u2019ve gathered these facts together from Richards\u2019s writing. Richards herself did not want to participate in this article. When I reached her on her cell phone, she told me she\u2019s trying to move on from what happened four years ago, and that she\u2019s spent years trying to reclaim her name. She said she\u2019s just trying to find a way to earn a living, and that \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the person where there\u2019s a car accident on the side of the road and people sit and gawk.\u201d She also told me that over the years, she\u2019s learned not to trust journalists. Period. I can\u2019t say I blame her. Search the web and Richards\u2019s name is forever tied to PyCon 2013. As for the men whose picture she tweeted? It\u2019s hard to even find their names. I had to trawl through LinkedIn\u2019s job history, and some deep subreddit threads, just to send them a request for comment. Inside the Startup Luring Thousands of Women into the Gig EconomyStella & Dot says it empowers women by helping them sell jewelry to their friends\u200a\u2014\u200abut don\u2019t call it \u201cdirect sales.\u201dbackchannel.com The writer Jon Ronson included a long section on Richards in his book So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed. In Ronson\u2019s careful retelling, the one doing the shaming is clearly Richards. Over a meeting with Ronson at the San Francisco airport, Richards muses that some of the backlash against her was instigated by Hank. Ronson describes feeling appalled. \u201cLater I felt bad that I hadn\u2019t stuck up for him,\u201d Ronson writes. Throughout the interlude, Ronson never reveals Hank\u2019s real name. Richards responded to the story by writing on a feminist blog: \u201cI question, and we should all question, why a man losing his job due to his own life choices is a more important story to tell than a woman who, within 72 hours, became the target of a massive, organized harassment campaign that ended in her public firing.\u201d Good question. There have always been women who spoke out, both in public and private channels, and often they\u2019ve suffered as a result. In many ways, this latest wave is the exception rather than the rule. Y-Vonne Hutchinson, the executive director of ReadySet, a company that helps startups diversify their hiring, argues that a lot has changed in the last four years. Unfortunately for Richards, her story unspooled during a more naive time. \u201cWe could still believe that it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Hutchinson reflects. \u201cWe could still give people and companies the benefit of the doubt and say that this is not a systemic issue.\u201d We hadn\u2019t yet come to terms with the fact that even \u201cnice\u201d guys like Bill Cosby, or powerful ones like Roger Ailes, could tally up dozens of victims; we didn\u2019t have 250 women at Kay Jewelers all telling similar stories of being sexually harassed. How the Internet Gave Mail-Order Brides the PowerRural Filipinas have flipped the dating script: Now they\u2019re the ones shopping for Western men.backchannel.com And perhaps most importantly, says Hutchinson, \u201cnow we have a president who says, \u2018grab women by the pussy.\u2019\u201d The election, she believes, debunked a lot of our most comforting lies. \u201c[It] pulled back the veil on a lot of myths that we\u2019ve been telling ourselves to make ourselves feel better,\u201d she says. \u201cThat we live in a post-racial sociality. That we live in a post-sexism society. That we live in a meritocracy.\u201d Against this backdrop, Susan Fowler\u2019s case might be the most perfect case for a newly woke public to rally behind. She\u2019s an accomplished engineer at a disgraced company with a bad-boy CEO who once joked that the ride-share service should be renamed \u201cBoob-er.\u201d And Fowler told her story from a position of strength, having landed in a new job and gathered a stunning array of well-documented anecdotes. Have we come far enough to understand harassment when it comes in even a slightly messier form? Probably not. We\u2019re still a long way from people being able to speak out without being prepared for consequences. The only way to be heard isn\u2019t a stellar one. But at least we\u2019re starting to listen.
