CREDIT: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin With a lopsided majority joined by a bipartisan coalition of judges, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held on Tuesday that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates federal civil rights law, at least in the context of the workplace. The court telegraphed in an order last October that Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College was likely to be a victory for victims of discrimination in the workplace. The final vote in the case, however, is a bit more surprising. Eight of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judges joined Tuesday\u2019s opinion, including Republican appointees Richard Posner, Joel Flaum, Frank Easterbrook, Ilana Rovner, and Kenneth Ripple. Only three judges dissented. The case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee\u2019s \u201csex.\u201d Though Title VII contains no explicit statement that discrimination on the basis of \u201csexual orientation\u201d is prohibited, two crucial Supreme Court precedents inform Chief Judge Diane Wood\u2019s majority opinion in Hively. The first is Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, which established that Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination is violated when an employee faces discrimination due to gender stereotyping. Thus, in that case, a female accountant could allege illegal discrimination if she was denied a partnership because her superiors deemed her too masculine. (One partner told her to take \u201ca course at charm school.\u201d Another deemed her too \u201cmacho.\u201d) One of the the core insights of Chief Judge Wood\u2019s decision in Hively is that, because she is a lesbian, \u201cHively represents the ultimate case of failure to conform to the female stereotype.\u201d Stereotypical women enter into romantic and sexual partnerships with men. Hively defies this stereotype by engaging in such relationships with women. So presuming that she must prefer relations with men is itself a form of gender stereotyping forbidden by Hopkins. Wood\u2019s opinion also offers several other reasons why sexual orientation discrimination should be understood as a form of sex discrimination. Indeed, as Wood explains, this case is actually pretty straightforward. \u201cHively alleges that if she had been a man married to a woman (or living with a woman, or dating a woman) and everything else had stayed the same, Ivy Tech would not have refused to promote her and would not have fired her,\u201d Wood writes. If this claim proves to be true, then it \u201cdescribes paradigmatic sex discrimination.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, Wood acknowledges that the lawmakers who drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 probably did not expect it to be used this way. But the conclusion that Title VII can be read more expansively than its drafters anticipated was embraced by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s opinion for the Supreme Court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services. Like the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision? Thank this guy. CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File Oncale was a case of male-on-male sexual harassment, something that, as Scalia wrote, \u201cwas assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.\u201d But so what? As Scalia explained, \u201cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201d A prohibition on discrimination \u201cbecause of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. sex\u201d was expansive enough to cover male-on-male sexual harassment in Oncale. And it is big enough to encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. So holds the Seventh Circuit in Hively. As Wood notes in her opinion, \u201cfor many years, the courts of appeals of this country understood the prohibition against sex discrimination to exclude discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\u201d Hively is now an outlier, and the Supreme Court typically takes up cases where the federal appeals courts disagree. It is all but certain to take up this case. That means the fate of gay and bisexual workers is likely to rest with Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often provides the fifth vote in favor of gay rights. Whether Kennedy does so in this case remains to be seen\u200a\u2014\u200athough the lopsided vote in Hively should be an encouraging sign for supporters of LGBT rights.
