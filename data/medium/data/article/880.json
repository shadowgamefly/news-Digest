According to The Verge, we can probably credit the Dutch for April Fools\u2019, which dates at least as far back as 1564, when it involved getting people to go on a \u201cfool\u2019s errand,\u201d like gathering pigeon\u2019s milk. In Scotland, the day involved tricking people into walking really fucking far with a stupid letter they kept delivering to the wrong person. Cut to about 150 years ago, and it was mostly kids being dicks to each other by gluing pennies to the street. But like everything in existence, once modern brands got their hands on an opportunity to seem cool and with it, everything changed, with absolutely no benefit to humanity. A roundup of the best hoaxes so far this year from brands over at Ad Week offers these as evidence: Rental car company Alamo made a video for their new cars that plan your vacation for you. Unclear what the funny part is. Restaurant chain Bob Evans has debuted a \u201cfarm to table\u201d beauty line that includes a sausage gravy beauty mask. Gross. Buffalo Wild Wings has launched a Rally Beard Sauce to grow your beard. Okay. Honda has introduced \u201chorn emojis\u201d on the steering wheel so drivers can \u201csafely express emotions.\u201d To make matters worse, because April Fools\u2019 falls on a Saturday this year, brands and websites are squeezing out their April Fools\u2019 jokes a day early so no one misses them, proof that no holiday is immune from the weeklong creep. And yet, none of this holds a prankster\u2019s magic relighting candle to the fact that April Fools\u2019 pranks are always dumb\u200a\u2014\u200aHulu for pets! Ugh\u2014and often cruel, attempts at humor by the uninspired and unoriginal to simply fuck with those they love. \u201cApril Fools\u2019 Day is to comedy what St. Patrick\u2019s Day is to Irish culture,\u201d John Oliver joked on Last Week Tonight. \u201cAnyone who claims to be excited about April Fools\u2019 Day is a sociopath, because what they\u2019re really saying is, I cannot wait to hurt the people close to me.\u201d MEL asked around for some terrible examples, and got back the story of a woman whose husband thought it would be hilarious to tell their two sons she\u2019d been arrested for knocking out a clerk at the store. There is no punchline. We also got a few stories from a particularly prankish theater whose April Fools\u2019 jokes ended in disaster: Someone switched the prop letters on stage for gibberish on an older, dyslexic actor with memory issues, who had been doing a stellar job until that point. Another used a live snake in a box to scare a child actor, who wet his pants onstage. Someone switched fake booze for the real thing in a scene where an actor had to down a whole drink in one gulp. The actor was diabetic and spent a week in the hospital. Final proof that the day needs to die is that we are already living April Fools\u2019 Day every day. It\u2019s called fake news. \u201cObama Signs Executive Order Banning the Pledge of Allegiance in Schools Nationwide,\u201d and \u201cTrump Offering Free One-Way Tickets to Africa and Mexico for Those Who Wanna Leave America,\u201d are just a few examples of the bigger hits. The entire internet, full of trolls and liars, has become an April Fools\u2019 joke in itself, but the joke\u2019s on us\u2014and as the saying goes, if you have to explain it, it\u2019s not funny. Tracy Moore is a staff writer at MEL. She last wrote about why Mike Pence is not that crazy for not dining alone with other women.
