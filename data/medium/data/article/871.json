{"name": "871", "parent": "", "content": "Professional Clowns Are All Kinds of Pissed About the \u2018IT\u2019\u00a0Remake Clowns say the film will only further diminish their imperiled profession Warner Bros. released the trailer for its IT remake last week, and if first impressions are any indication, the film stands to be even more terrifying than the original: The trailer broke records for number of views (197 million) in 24 hours, according to Slashfilm, and fans of the original 1990 miniseries are already ecstatic about the new rendition that\u2019s set to scare the shit out of them in September. But one special interest group is pissed about the remake: clowns. As in real-life clowns. The kind you\u2019d see at a circus or hire for a children\u2019s birthday party. The new IT film is going to inspire yet another wave of anti-clown paranoia in our country, they say, and can only harm the already-drooping clowning industry. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be bad for clowns,\u201d says Guilford Adams, a 42-year-old L.A. resident who has performed as \u201cGilly\u201d for 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s ruining our business,\u201d adds 33-year-old Nick Kane of L.A. (Clown name: \u201cMr. Nick.\u201d) Roger Fojas, a 48-year-old clown whose characters include \u201cRingmaster Roger\u201d and \u201cHumpy Pumpy,\u201d worries IT will make kids so terrified of clowns that their parents will stop booking clowns for birthday parties. Kane says he\u2019s already experiencing the negative effects of the IT remake: He noticed a considerable drop in traffic to his Yelp page in the days immediately following the trailer\u2019s release. It\u2019s never been harder to be a clown, all of them say. Clowns were once a source of entertainment and even joy, but their depiction in the media has robbed them of their wholesomeness and transformed them into something children fear. The contemporary \u201ccreepy clown\u201d motif dates back to the early 1980s with John Wayne Gacy, the Chicago-based serial killer who raped and murdered dozens of boys and young men during the 1970s, and who, it was later revealed, spent his free time entertaining neighborhood children as Pogo the Clown. While Gacy was executed by lethal injection in 1994, his legacy lives on today in the form of a widespread cultural aversion to clowns. And his negative impact on clowns was cemented by Stephen King\u2019s 1986 horror novel IT\u2014a 1,000-page tome about Pennywise, a child-killing clown who lives in the sewers and terrorizes the tiny town of Derry, Maine; and the plucky group of youngsters who set out to vanquish him once and for all. The novel was an enormous hit, even by King\u2019s standards; a Rolling Stone readers\u2019 poll placed it as his second-best book of all time, ahead of The Shining and behind The Stand. Many only know IT from its original adaption, a 1990 miniseries that put a horrifying face on Pennywise, and solidified in the public consciousness that clowns were evil beings who use makeup and balloons to lure in gullible children and murder them. Films such as Poltergeist and Killer Clowns From Outer Space further deepened our cultural fear of clowns, says Fojas. The cultural aversion to clowns is now so intense that Fojas likens it to racism. He was cast as a creepy clown on a reality TV show last year, and he says crew members treated him as if he were an African-American in the 1950s South. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s racist, per se, but it creates that kind of visceral reaction.\u201d Indeed, clowns in London recently cried \u201cracism\u201d over a no-clowns sign placed in a bookstore window. (Yes, some clowns apparently don\u2019t understand what racism is.) Anti-clown sentiment hit its peak last fall when reports of pranksters dressed as creepy clowns poured in from all over the country. People were so terrified of clowns that Kane got the cops called on him while he was just walking to a gig. \u201cWe just experienced a nice break from the scary clown meme from last October,\u201d Kane says. \u201cAnd just when things are starting to normalize, the IT trailer comes and it\u2019s like, \u2018Here we go again.\u2019\u201d More generally, the fear of clowns has created a nationwide clown shortage. There simply aren\u2019t enough young people going into clowning to sustain the profession, as membership in clowning trade organizations has plummeted over the past several years. \u201cIt\u2019s a dying profession. And the people who do it and scrape together a living have to grapple with the fact that it\u2019s cool and hip not to like clowns,\u201d Adams says. \u201cThe ultimate prick in this [IT movie] is that it\u2019s going to turn young consumers away from an art form that\u2019s sweet and nice and not about the Kardashians and Minecraft.\u201d But the injury cuts deeper than just business. IT has largely ruined the emotional upside of being a clown, they say. Many got into clowning because they loved bringing joy and laughter to children, and films like IT make it nearly impossible to elicit that kind of warm emotional reaction. Adams, for instance, got into clowning because he wanted to delight people the way his heroes Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers once did. Instead, he finds himself in a culture that\u2019s been conditioned to be terrified of him\u2014and the upcoming IT film is only going to further reinforce that idea, if not introduce it to an entirely new generation of clown-haters. \u201cNo one sticks up for a clown. The only thing cooler to dislike is a mime. It\u2019s silly and stupid, and I wish people would focus on the good clowns out there.\u201d John McDermott is a staff writer at MEL.
