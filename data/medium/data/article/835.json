On March 8 2017 Barcelona completed arguably the greatest comeback in recent history knocking out PSG and progressing on to the quarter finals of the champions league. At 3\u20130 we were optimistic but when Cavani pulled one back for PSG it was mission impossible, now Barca need 3 goals to win. But from the 85th minute onwards something magical happened.

There are very few things that get me that excited like the time when we had a week off of school because my teacher called in sick (I hope she\u2019s doing well now. Its been a couple of years though) Back to the article! You want to build muscle. I want to build muscle. We all want to build muscle. With muscle mass comes confidence, strength and big biceps. The idea of sculpting your body and transforming your physique is an exciting one. Unfortunately, it is not an easy process especially after those newbie gains are gone. What are newbie gains you ask? They are all the gains you made in in your first year of lifting due to your body adapting to a new stimulus. But after that first year is up it becomes a lot more challenging to put on muscle and see the same results. You\u2019re going to have to make some changes with your training and it starts by acquiring more knowledge relevant to your goal and putting that knowledge to action. If you\u2019re looking to optimise muscle growth here\u2019s one key tip that\u2019ll help you do just that. Develop the Mind Muscle Connection Remember that guy in your school who kept rambling on and on on about \u2018FEELING the muscle when lifting the weight\u2019? He was right. Arnold Schwarzenegger talked about this mind muscle connection as well. \u201cThe weights are just a means to an end. How well you contract the muscles is what training is all about\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aArnold This isn\u2019t some hokus pokus theory. Studies have shown that concentrating on the specific muscles significantly increases muscle activation and results in a better training effect. How Do We Do\u00a0This? This mental connection between the subconscious and the weights was believed to be so advanced that only the greatest minds on the planet can acquire it. How good was Logan BTW?? Best Marvel movie\u00a0ever. Luckily for us times have changed and there is light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m about to go technical right now but stay with me. Every repetition consists of 2 parts: Lifting the weight (concentric) and lowering the weight (eccentric). On a bench press for example, pushing the bar away from you is the concentric phase and lowering the bar towards you is the eccentric phase. The eccentric portion is when the muscle is being stretched and lengthened. When trying to build muscle, controlling the eccentric portion of the lift is the MOST important part. Instead of using a heavy weight and relying on momentum, pick a weight you can control for the specified number of reps and try to focus fully on the muscle you\u2019re supposed to feel when lifting and lowering the weight. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re doing a seated row to build your back. Whether you\u2019re training for strength or even more importantly for size, you should work on developing this mind muscle connection every time you train. Because if you\u2019re not feeling your biceps on a bicep curl\u2026 what\u2019s the point? In the early stages of your muscle building journey, HOW you lift the weight is far more important than the amount you can lift.
