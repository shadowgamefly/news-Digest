Was it really two whole months since her aunt had disappeared without trace? Yes, the grid confirmed, it was, although without trace wasn\u2019t quite the right phrase. Without anyone saying a dicky-bird would be more accurate. And Uncle Tom was supposed to be coming round for Sunday dinner again, although this time he was late. He had been a semi-permanent guest since his wife\u2019s disappearance, as if he couldn\u2019t fend for himself. And still, after all this time, nobody would talk about Aunt Katie, not a mention of her name. Jenny\u2019s birthday card had been signed for the two of them by Uncle Tom. For something to do before her uncle arrived, Jenny opened a puzzle book. Change boy to man in three moves, she read. Bon? Was French allowed in these things? Probably not, she reflected, since not everyone was lucky enough to go to France for their holidays. No, it would be bay, and then ban and man. Too simple. She sighed, and looked up at the calendar again. It was still Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d her father called from the dining-room. They? Jenny dropped the book and ran to look out through the front window. Yes, there on the drive was Uncle Tom\u2019s car, and there in the passenger seat was her mysterious disappearing aunt, now reappeared. The dining-table was already set for five places. I shall demand an explanation, Jenny told herself. At the right time. \u201cHello, Jenny,\u201d Uncle Tom said, bustling through the door. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d He was already twirling his watch on its chain in front of him. \u201cAh, no you don\u2019t, because I have them all!\u201d The watch popped into his waistcoat pocket. \u201cOne day she\u2019ll get tired of that gag,\u201d Jenny\u2019s mother said behind her, \u201cand then where will you be, favourite uncle?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll still be her favourite uncle,\u201d said Tom. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that away from me. Oh, no,\u201d he went on in a cracked singing voice, \u201cthey caaant take that away from me!\u201d \u201cI could,\u201d came the voice of Aunt Katie. \u201cYou just watch me.\u201d Jenny grabbed her chance. \u201cHello Auntie,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you enjoy Europe?\u201d \u201cEurope?\u201d Her aunt\u2019s face was more surprised than amused as she glanced at each of the other adults in turn. \u201cWhat have you been telling the girl?\u201d \u201cThey said you were working in Europe,\u201d Jenny put in, before she could be sidelined again. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t say where, and Europe\u2019s a big place.\u201d \u201cYes it is,\u201d said Aunt Katie. \u201cAnd I\u2019d tell you all about it, only my glass is empty.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a glass,\u201d said Jenny\u2019s father. \u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d It was an incredible tale, Jenny thought as she listened. Aunt Katie was not a spy, she was almost certain. She had surely not been kidnapped and held for ransom. Her story of entrapment and escape was beyond belief. Wasn\u2019t it? \u201cI poked one of them in the eyes with the chopsticks, and hit the other round the head with the tyre iron,\u201d her aunt was saying. \u201cSo he was down, but the first chased me round the room in a rage, until he fell over an artificial plant that I kicked out of the fireplace. That settled him. I tied them up together, there wasn\u2019t much lying around I could use for that, I had to use a roll of clingfilm. I considered putting it all over their faces too, but I didn\u2019t want to suffocate them, just cover their mouths so that they couldn\u2019t raise an alarm too quickly.\u201d \u201cThe chemicals in clingfilm would kill them if you left it there long enough,\u201d Jenny\u2019s father said, topping up his sister\u2019s wine. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Aunt Katie agreed, \u201cand this wasn\u2019t even modern stuff, it was an old box of Saran Wrap, genuine American. God knows where they got it from in that neck of the woods. Is it even called that in the States any more? I doubt it. Anyway, I picked up my purse, which they had conveniently not yet ransacked, borrowed one of their bicycles to race down to the railway station, then caught the train to the airport and the first plane home.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWith all the money.\u201d \u201cA hostage\u2019s fortune,\u201d said Jenny\u2019s father. He too had a smirk that Jenny could not interpret. \u201cHm. I think we deserve another bottle.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said his sister. \u201cOh\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d She reached into the large Duty Free bag that had been ostentatiously parked beside her throughout the narrative, and pulled out a teddy-bear. \u201cPresent for you,\u201d she said, handing it to Jenny. \u201cSorry it couldn\u2019t be here for your birthday, but by the calendar they use where I was, that\u2019s not until tomorrow. And I\u2019ll tell you something else,\u201d Aunt Katie added, addressing the grownups, \u201cI am never going there again.\u201d \u201cNever say ngurlignnnk,\u201d Uncle Tom grinned. The celebration in the other room was becoming raucous. They are not going to tell me anything, Jenny told herself again. They never do. I might just as well try to solve word-puzzles as the ones they make up. At least with these I know there\u2019s an answer. Although... She frowned at the puzzle-book. Change tree to logs in four moves. Most of these were easy, but not this one. Tr\u00e9s? \u201cHaving trouble?\u201d asked Uncle Tom, picking up the book without waiting for an answer. \u201cTree to logs in four moves, ah\u2026 yes. Do you know what it is?\u201d \u201cI thought it might be French,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cCould be if you want,\u201d her uncle said, \u201cbut you can do it in English. Shall I tell you?\u201d Jenny nodded. Obviously, over a thing that didn\u2019t matter a whit, he was going to tell her. Her uncle counted the steps off on his fingers. \u201cTree\u200a\u2014\u200achainsaw\u200a\u2014\u200ahospital\u200a\u2014\u200acall a wood merchant\u200a\u2014\u200alogs.\u201d His eyes had the old twinkle again. \u201cUncle!\u201d Jenny snapped, finally exasperated with her entire extended family. \u201cIs anyone ever going to explain anything without having to make a joke of it?\u201d Uncle Tom grinned at her. \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d *Previous chapters: ", "title": "A Prompt\u00a0Getaway", "sentences": [{"3480": "A Prompt\u00a0Getaway"}, {"7668": "Concluding A Hostage To\u00a0Fortune*"}, {"af26": "Collage by me (sources)"}, {"3fca": "Jenny glanced up at the calendar.
