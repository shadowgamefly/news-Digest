Should I start with the dead rat being found years ago in my not then husband\u2019s toolbox back in Phoenix? Should I start with him moving the dead rat 1500 miles across country? Should I start with the fact the dead rat is still in his toolbox in our garage here in Iowa? Should I start with how the dead rat freaks me out? Or, should I start with the fact that I\u2019ve asked my husband to remove the dead rat roughly 37 times and it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s dead. The rat is dead. It\u2019s gross. When I brought it to his attention 16 times ago he took photos and text them to a friend. While we were doing our weekend chores my husband cleaned the garage but left the dead rat yet again. I asked my husband why he doesn\u2019t get rid of the dead rat and he laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just there.\u201d I responded with, \u201cYou know when a spouse dies and the other spouse is clutching onto the tombstone at the cemetery sobbing so hard they can\u2019t breathe, and they can\u2019t move on, and they can\u2019t survive without their loved one? If you die and leave me with that dead rat, that won\u2019t be me. \u201d This is the end of my story. You can contribute to my writing habit by clicking this link.
