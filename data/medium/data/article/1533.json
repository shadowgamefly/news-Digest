During a speech at The Center for Strategic and International Studies on Thursday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo denounced Wikileaks, saying the organization \u201cwalks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to call out Wikileaks for what it is\u200a\u2014\u200aa non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,\u201d he said. Pompeo went on to discuss the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat Russian military intelligence\u200a\u2014\u200athe GRU\u200a\u2014\u200ahad used Wikileaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.\u201d But during the presidential campaign, Pompeo\u200a\u2014\u200athen a Republican U.S. representative from Kansas\u200a\u2014\u200atweeted out an article about hacked Democratic National Committee emails to attack Democrats. \u201cNeed further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by Wikileaks,\u201d Pompeo\u2019s since-deleted July 24 tweet read. Pompeo was grilled about that tweet during his confirmation hearing to become CIA director. Though he touted the hacked emails published by Wikileaks in July, Pompeo told Sen. Angus King (I-ME) he \u201cnever believed that Wikileaks was a credible source of information.\u201d But Pompeo should\u2019ve known better than to publish that tweet on July 24. The Washington Post first linked Russian hackers to the DNC hack on June 14, with hacked DNC emails first appearing online the next day. Wikileaks itself published 20,000 hacked DNC emails on July 22, just ahead of the Democratic National Convention\u200a\u2014\u200abut none of that apparently caused Pompeo to second guess amplifying their work two days later. Pompeo\u2019s comments on Thursday are also uncomfortable in light of Trump\u2019s effusive praise for Wikileaks on the campaign trail. During a rally in October in Pennsylvania, Trump said \u201cI love Wikileaks!\u201d while the crowd chanted, \u201cLock her up!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet,\u201d Trump added, before reading aloud the contents of emails hacked from the Clinton campaign and leaked to Wikileaks. Trump mentioned Wikileaks 164 times during the last month of the election. Nonetheless, in January Trump said the information published by Wikileaks had \u201cabsolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d Since his inauguration, Trump has repeatedly downplayed the scandal surrounding his administration\u2019s ties with Russia and asserted that people should instead focus on leakers who make his administration look bad. While the extent of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russian hackers remains unclear, in March news broke that Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant and adviser, exchanged direct messages on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0\u200a\u2014\u200aan account the U.S. intelligence community believes was used as a front for hackers directed by the Russian government. In an August 17 message, Guccifer 2.0 offered to help Stone. \u201ci\u2019m pleased to say that u r great man,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 wrote to Stone. \u201cplease tell me if i can help u anyhow. it would be a great pleasure to me.\u201d Wikileaks served Pompeo\u2019s purposes while he was trying to bring down Hillary Clinton, but the situation has changed now that he\u2019s running the CIA. In March, WikiLeaks published \u201cthousands of pages describing sophisticated software tools and techniques used by the [CIA] to break into smartphones, computers and even Internet-connected televisions,\u201d the New York Times reported. UPDATE: Wikileaks trolled Pompeo for amplifying their leaks during the campaign before turning against them as CIA director.
