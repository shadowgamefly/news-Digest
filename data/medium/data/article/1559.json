CREDIT: AP Photo/Susan Walsh The following was adapted from an earlier piece on the future of the Supreme Court under Gorsuch. Well, it\u2019s all done except for one final vote. Along party lines, the Senate voted Thursday to change its rules in order to clear the way for Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Soon, Gorsuch will almost certainly occupy the Supreme Court seat that Senate Republicans held open for a year in the hopes that Donald Trump would fill it. Gorsuch\u2019s record places him to the right of Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon Gorsuch hopes to replace, and he may prove to be the Court\u2019s most conservative member. One strong indication that will be the case: In the middle of his testimony, every single member of the Court that Gorsuch is poised to join ruled that a decision their new colleague wrote \u2014a decision that significantly weakened a law protecting children with disabilities\u200a\u2014\u200awas wrongly decided. And Gorsuch is likely to have a very significant impact on the law very quickly. Because the Court was down a justice for more than a year, the remaining justices largely avoided contentious issues that were likely to produce 4\u20134 splits. That\u2019s created a backlog of cases involving issues\u200a\u2014\u200aranging from voting rights, to LGBT equality, to birth control, to the rights of workers\u200a\u2014\u200athat are now likely to be taken up in a hurry. The right to\u00a0vote Before Scalia\u2019s death, the Roberts Court was not friendly toward voting rights. The Court permitted voter ID laws, a common method of voter suppression. It struck down a major prong of the Voting Rights Act. And it\u2019s placed increasingly high procedural hurdles in front of litigants seeking to protect their right to vote. In one particularly notable case, a federal appeals court struck down North Carolina\u2019s omnibus voter suppression law. As the appeals court explained, North Carolina lawmakers \u201crequested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices,\u201d then used this data to design a voter suppression law that disproportionately targeted African Americans and that minimized its impact on white voters. BREAKING: Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down The Worst Voter Suppression Law In The NationLet\u2019s summarize a federal appeals court\u2019s decision striking down much of North Carolina\u2019s omnibus voter suppression law\u2026thinkprogress.org And yet, when this case reached the Supreme Court, all four of the Court\u2019s conservatives voted to reinstate the North Carolina law. If Scalia were still alive, the law would have been in effect during the 2016 election. Assuming that none of these four conservatives have second thoughts, Gorsuch will almost certainly provide a fifth vote they need to uphold laws similar to North Carolina\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aeven, apparently, when the law was enacted for the very purpose of preventing black people from voting. Gerrymandering Even if Democrats sweep back into the White House in 2020, Republicans have a significant advantage in U.S. House races thanks to congressional districts that overwhelmingly favor the GOP. Last November, however, a federal court struck down Wisconsin\u2019s state assembly maps as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The plaintiffs in that case, moreover, have devised a mathematical formula that will allow courts to sort out gerrymandered maps\u200a\u2014\u200apotentially requiring states across the country to draw fairer congressional maps. The Supreme Court is likely to hear this case, Whitford v. Gill, as soon as its next term. Before the election, when most Democrats believed that either President Obama or the woman who received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump would get to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs in Whitford looked very likely to prevail. With Gorsuch on the Court, victory for these plaintiffs appears much more doubtful. It is not, however, impossible. Though conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy has been skeptical of gerrymandering suits in the past, he did write in a 2004 opinion that a gerrymandering case should be allowed to proceed if \u201cworkable standards\u201d emerge \u201cfor measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights.\u201d Whitford, with its mathematical formula, offers such a standard\u200a\u2014\u200aand thus a shot at winning a fifth vote. Working while\u00a0gay Earlier this week, a federal appeals court held in a lopsided 8\u20133 vote, that the federal ban on \u201csex\u201d discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Among other things, the appeals court explained in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College, discrimination against gay or bisexual employees is a form of illegal gender stereotyping. A lesbian woman \u201crepresents the ultimate case of failure to conform to the female stereotype,\u201d because they enter into sexual relationships with women instead of men. Other appeals courts disagree with this outcome, which means that it is almost certain to be heard by the Supreme Court. One of the Court\u2019s primary roles is to resolve \u201ccircuit splits\u201d where one federal appeals court reaches a different outcome than another. As is often the case in gay rights cases, Hively is likely to turn on Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s vote. Though a conservative, Kennedy authored a series of cases recognizing that the Constitution protects against may forms of sexual orientation discrimination, including the Court\u2019s landmark marriage equality decision. Gorsuch, meanwhile, has a record of reading civil rights legislation narrowly\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding in the case where he read a law protecting disabled children so narrowly that every single member of the Supreme Court disagreed with him. Unions Last year, the Supreme Court heard Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case seeking to defund many public sector unions. By law, these unions are required to bargain on behalf of union members and non-members alike, so if a worker within a bargaining unit decides not to join the union, they still get all the same wages and benefits they would if they did pay union dues. To prevent free-riders, who would enjoy nearly all of the benefits of being in a union without having to contribute to the union\u2019s costs, unions often charge \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cfair share\u201d fees to non-members to recoup each non-member\u2019s share of the costs of bargaining. Public Sector Unions Just Got Brutalized In The Supreme CourtWASHINGTON, DC\u200a\u2014\u200aLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. Friedrichs asked the Supreme Court to make these fair share fees illegal, at least when they are charged by public sector unions. The result would be that many individual workers would have an incentive to stop paying into their union, until the union was so starved for funds that it was no longer able to bargain effectively or conduct other union business. Without Scalia, the Court split 4\u20134 in Friedrichs. But Gorsuch is likely to be the fifth vote against unions. Birth control On the final day of the Supreme Court\u2019s last term, Justice Samuel Alito was angry. A Washington state regulation requires pharmacies to \u201cdeliver lawfully prescribed drugs or devices to patients.\u201d The owners of one pharmacy refused to comply with this regulation, because they object to certain forms of contraception on religious grounds and did not want to dispense it. If this case arose under federal law, the pharmacy would have a much stronger case. Those cases are controlled by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which, at least after Hobby Lobby, offers religious objectors protections above and beyond the protections afforded by the Constitution. Justice Alito\u2019s Bizarre And Offensive Attack On Atheists\u201cThis case is an ominous sign,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito begins one of the final opinions released on this last day of the\u2026thinkprogress.org State laws that burden religion, however, are valid so long as they do not single out people of faith for inferior treatment. As Justice Scalia wrote in Employment Division v. Smith, the Constitution \u201cdoes not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\u201d Alito wanted his Court to hear Stormans v. Wiesman, the case brought by the pharmacy owners. He claimed that the Washington state regulation \u201cspecifically targeted religious objections,\u201d noting a state guidance document which explains that the regulation \u201cdoes not allow a pharmacy to refer a patient to another pharmacy to avoid filling the prescription due to moral or ethical objections.\u201d Of course a \u201cmoral or ethical\u201d objection is a different thing than a \u201creligious\u201d objection. So, if the state\u2019s guidance can be used to tar Washington with accusations of religious discrimination, it is likely that many other states will become vulnerable to such accusations. The practical impact of a Supreme Court decision in favor of the plaintiffs in Stormans could be to impose the Hobby Lobby regime on all state laws, and not just federal law. It takes four votes for the Supreme Court to hear a case. With Scalia dead, Alito mustered only two of his colleagues in support of his bid to take up Stormans. Gorsuch is likely to be the fourth vote to take up a similar case. Freedom from discrimination A closely related question to the issue in Stormans is whether religion can be wielded as a sword to cut down anti-discrimination laws. Not too long ago, the idea that religious objections could justify discrimination was considered ludicrous. In 1968, a racist business owner claimed that the ban on whites-only lunch counters \u201ccontravenes the will of God,\u201d and that he should be allowed to ignore it. A unanimous Supreme Court rejected this claim, labeling it \u201cpatently frivolous.\u201d Times have changed, however, and the last few years have seen a rush of pizza-joint owners, cake bakers, photographers, and other anti-LGBT business owners who claim that their religion gives them a right to ignore anti-discrimination laws. The Hobby Lobby decision will no doubt embolden these religious objectors (as would a potential decision applying Hobby Lobby to state laws). Though Hobby Lobby indicates that religious objections cannot be used to evade \u201cprohibitions on racial discrimination,\u201d it conspicuously does not rule out the use of religious objections to enable discrimination against women, LGBT people or other groups. Trans rights Earlier this year, the Supreme Court intended to hear Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., which concerns the right of trans students to use a bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The justices wound up kicking the case back down to the lower courts, however, after the Trump administration rescinded an Obama-era policy guidance that was at the heart of the case. Although, a federal appeals court sided with Gavin Grimm, the trans student challenging a Virginia school board\u2019s policy preventing him from using the men\u2019s room at school, the lower court opinion relied primarily on the Obama administration\u2019s pro-trans interpretation of a federal education regulation. Now that the Trump administration walked away from this interpretation, it was appropriate for the Supreme Court to send the case back down so that the lower court consider the remaining issues in the case. Supreme Court tosses transgender student\u2019s case back to lower courtAnd it\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault.thinkprogress.org The issue of anti-trans discrimination is not going away, however, and it is likely that either this case or a related case will make it up to the justices again soon. Although Grimm won in the appeals court, he did not benefit from this ruling because the Supreme Court stayed it\u200a\u2014\u200ain a decision joined by all four conservatives plus Justice Stephen Breyer (although Breyer wrote that he joined the conservatives solely as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d). That suggests Kennedy and possibly even Breyer are uncertain votes in favor of trans rights. Gorsuch is very unlikely to side with trans students in a similar position to Grimm, which means that those students will almost certainly need to win Kennedy and Breyer in order to prevail. The workplace The Roberts Court has not been good to workers\u2019 rights. Even setting aside Hobby Lobby and the coming attacks on public sector unions, the Court shrunk protections for victims of sexual harassment and for people who face retaliation because they reported discrimination. The very first bill President Barack Obama signed into law was in response to a Supreme Court decision that made it harder for women to bring suits when they experience pay discrimination. Gorsuch is likely to continue this pattern if he is appointed to the Supreme Court. One case where his influence is likely to be felt right away is Ernst & Young LLP v. Morris, which concerns whether an employee can be forced to sign away their right to bring a class action suit against their employer as a condition of employment. The Court recently scheduled arguments in this case for its next term. Trump\u2019s Muslim\u00a0ban Finally, it is likely that President Trump\u2019s attempt to bar many Muslims from entering the United States will eventually reach the Supreme Court. Although many lower courts have not been kind to this ban, it is worth noting that the Roberts Court routinely stakes out positions that are well to the right of the median lower-court judge\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in cases involving politically charged issues such as Obamacare and birth control. Though it is unlikely that any of the four left-leaning justices will side with Trump\u2019s ban, if the four conservatives back the ban and Gorsuch is confirmed, he will be the tie-breaking vote. Gorsuch\u2019s record, moreover, suggests that he may share the views of the Court\u2019s most conservative member, Justice Clarence Thomas.
