How Your Brain Makes Decisions As soon as a situation pops up, the three parts of our brain try to resolve the issue in different ways. For instance, let\u2019s say you walk into a room and see a molten lava cake oozing with chocolate sauce. You start to salivate (just writing this makes me hungry). Your reptilian brain sees food, while your limbic brain imagines how delicious it would be to bite into the cake. On the other hand, your rational neocortex sees the calorie-dense cake and says, \u201cHold on a second. I\u2019m supposed to be watching my weight.

Make Peace in Times of\u00a0War With all these temptations, it seems like you and I are doomed to eat whatever we want, shy away from opportunities, and spend lavishly outside our budget. What hope is there if our brains are working against us? Don\u2019t despair just yet. There\u2019s good news. For one, we get wiser as we grow up. Our cortex helps us delay gratification in favor of long-term rewards. As children, this part of the brain isn\u2019t quite developed, which is why kids have a harder time resisting the marshmallow than adults do. When we go through our teenage and adult years, our cortex develops and matures, which can then communicate better with the other parts of our brain. While that\u2019s an improvement, we still easily get seduced by the bag of Doritos nearby. Here are some methods that I\u2019ve used to help my brain do what\u2019s best for me in the long run. 1. Manage your environment. I\u2019ve noticed that cravings happen most often when I see an object. My brain then thinks, \u201cI want that!\u201d Since I\u2019ve placed healthier snacks and food nearby, I don\u2019t need to expend energy trying to resist temptation. Managing your surroundings also works when you want to achieve an important goal. Since I made writing a regular habit, I talk to like-minded people and have resources at hand to help me with this skill. Doing so makes it easier to keep going. 2. Tend to basic\u00a0needs. If possible, find ways to work with your reptilian and limbic brains, not against them. Even if the older parts of your brain don\u2019t always work in your best interest, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re evil. The best way to tend to their needs is to maintain your energy levels. Feeling tired? Take a nap or get more rest. Is your stomach grumbling? Eat balanced meals throughout the day. Cranky from stress? Go and play. When your energy levels aren\u2019t being taken care of, your mood drops and your reasoning skills worsen. 3. Tie emotion to your\u00a0goals. Our emotions can easily overpower any logic deduction skills we have. So if you really want to start creating a habit, then associate it with an emotion. For instance, if you forget to floss your teeth, put a sign up reminding yourself that cavities are painful. On the other hand, if you find it hard to work on a project, find ways to make it exciting. You can also picture how your life will benefit from completing a task. 4. Just do\u00a0it. When we feel nervous or scared of doing something, we often try to talk ourselves into becoming more confident. While this method helps boost up our self-esteem, there comes a point when you just have to jump. In my case, I felt nervous about sending cold emails to reach out to strangers. I tried to reason to my fears about why it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. But eventually, I just had to go ahead and do it. Now, I don\u2019t mind sending cold emails and actually see it as a fun process. Tip the Scales In Your\u00a0Favor Our decisions are often driven by factors outside of logic and reasoning. Distractions and emotions can lead us away from where we want to go. But if you can find ways to get parts of the brain to cooperate and behave according to your goals, then you\u2019re well on your way to tipping the scales back in your favor.
