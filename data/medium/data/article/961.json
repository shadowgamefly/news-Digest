Political Meeting The open-to-the-public (special price for Politiken subscribers) meeting was hosted by Politiken, a left-leaning Danish national newspaper and was chaired by Marcus Rubin, editor of the Politiken \u201cchronicle\u201d section for reader op-eds: Marcus Rubin (@marcusrubin) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from Marcus Rubin (@marcusrubin). Middle East Correspondent for Danish Newspaper Politiken based in\u2026twitter.com According to his Twitter profile, Marcus is Middle Eastern Correspondent for the Danish Newspaper Politiken (which hosted the event) and is based in Beirut. The Talk Rufus kicked off by listing the triumvirate that dominated the election: the courts, the media and the people thus echoing the three arms of government, the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. Rufus stated that it was fundamentally wrong for Trump not to seek to unify. Here\u2019s a link to JFK\u2019s moving inauguration speech that sought to do just that: \u201cWe observe today, not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom.\u201d The stepping down of National security advisor General Michael Flynn on Monday night was discussed, with Rufus suggesting that Flynn\u2019s position was possibly even more significant that that of the vice-president. No coverage of this resignation would be complete without this delightfully-ironic clip of Flynn: and an extended version of the same clip tweeted by the one-and-only Sarah Kendzior: The Anti-Establishment Narrative Was Never Directed at\u00a0Obama Rufus discussed the election, including the insurgent elements. He talked about the anti-establishment narrative and why it was never directed at Obama. He talked about Bernie Sanders and the unlikliehood that he would have been elected\u200a\u2014\u200acompared to the same likliehood of Trump being elected, which at the time seemed to be nil for both. \u201cBernie must get out of the way of Democrats.\u201d Rufus made it clear that the Democratic party had not imagined that Trump would win. He described how, the night after the election, he imagined waking up the next day and reasurring his female relatives that yes, a woman could become president; instead of which he stayed up all night seeing the results unfold. Rufus reiterated what he had mentioned in a tweet a few days before: The Democrats had not heeded the warning sounded from across the Atlantic by Brexit: Goodbye and Thanks for all the Grossly-Overpriced KippersGoodbye and Thanks for All the Overpriced KippersThank you Brexit for re-igniting my passion for politics with a\u2026medium.com even though it was clear to some already then: Trump Will WinYou\u2019re right.medium.com As Jon Stewart put it in a remarkably prescient interview with Nancy Pelosi, the democratic party underestimated the fury of the American people against the system of corruption in Washington. Not, as Pelosi argued, a good system with a few corrupt people but a corrupt system. As questions from the floor began, Rufus made an oblique reference to the anti-intellectualism and lack of deference by the new administration to employees of state agencies and semi-state bodies whose experience and expertise ought to be invaluable to them. Under the chairmanship of Marcus Rubin, Gifford covered many aspects of the post-election situation. He spoke about the last twenty-six days and about the ALT-Right. He intimated that the checks and balances are still in place and said that the ALT-right was not a doomsday cult. When asked about Trump\u2019s strategy chief, he said, \u201cStephen Bannon has made his livliehood driving a wedge between different demographic groups.\u201d There was also a great deal of discussion about the neccessity for Trump staying in place, that his extreme unpredictability and instability (3am tweets were mentioned several times) stood in contrast to the ultra-conservative and predictable Mike Pence, who according to Rufus, is similar to George W. Bush. Rufus was asked where he gets his news and he emphasized the importance of being broadly informed across the political spectrum. He mentioned the importance and the richness of the opportunity now facing The New York Times (NYT Opinion) and Washington Post. He also mentioned The Wall Street Journal (WSJ Graphics), VOX (VoxEurop) Slate and two individuals, Ezra Klein and Paul Krugman. West Virginia and\u00a0Dukakis Rufus also spoke about the disillusionment of the American people with the current party structure and spoke about the volatility of, for example, West Virginia, a coal mining area which moved from being a win for the Democrat Dukakis (one of his few state wins) in 1988 to becoming a staunchly Republican state in subsequent elections. When asked if he could say anything good about Trump, he said that he didn\u2019t buckle to political pressure and that he garnered respect for that. Wage War against Cynicism and\u00a0Apathy As the evening drew to a close, Rufus urged people to move towards greater levels of activism and engagement in the political process. This was, in fact, his prime motivation for creating his reality TV series, according to CNN: \u201cThe original intent was how do you get people in their 20s to pay attention to what an ambassador does. Because they actually don\u2019t care.\u201d Kennedy Rufus mentioned his beginnings in the offices of Ted Kennedy, where he met Obama for the first time, when Obamacare was mentioned in a question from the floor: KennedycareWhy do they call it Obamacare? And why the perjorative tone?healthcareinamerica.us \u201cEdward Kennedy was my hero\u201d, Rufus said, when reminded of the heartfelt letter the sole-surviving Kennedy brother penned to Obama; \u201cThe great unfinished business of our society\u201d: KennedycareSenator Edward Kennedy wrote this letter to President Obama:medium.com I asked Rufus what Comey was thinking of when he successfully diverted the election away from its course towards a near-certain Trump defeat in the closing days of the campaign: James Comey and the End of The Rule Of LawVote Hillary if only to ensure that James Comey gets fired.medium.com Rufus (wisely!) refused to be drawn. Closing Remarks In his typical self-deprecating manner, Rufus described himself in his previous life as the \u201cpale sweating guy backstage\u201d when asked about his political ambitions. Having not previously imagined himself as a political figure, he is now considering entering the political arena. Rufus\u2019 infectious optimism is a delightful antidote to the ubiquitous fatalism surrounding us today. Rufus possesses the unusual ability to lift your spirits with his directness and the warmth of his personality. His genuine delight in this type of town-hall event is irresistible but his light-heartedness does not detract in the slightest from the seriousness of his core message which he articulates clearly and uncompromisingly and which is the title of this article: \u201cPoliticization of the judiciary is the biggest problem facing the US\u00a0today\u201d Thank you for reading this far.
