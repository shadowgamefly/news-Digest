All the horror stories you were told about this man pale in comparison to the horror stories they were deliberately omitting from their coverage of the candidate they were attempting to inflict upon this planet. Trump could tank the economy, stop all immigration, build a wall around the entire continental United States and be featured in a viral video getting urinated on by Vladimir Putin himself, and as long as he spared America from a world war with a nuclear superpower, he would still have been a better president than Hillary Clinton would have been. The further into conflict two nuclear superpowers get, the greater the likelihood of a nuclear warhead being deployed either by accident, on purpose, or some mixture of the two due to unforeseeable circumstances in the unpredictable chaos of war, and once one nuke gets deployed, they all do.", "title": "", "parent": "955", "creatorid": "67d7c6d8d36a", "sentenceid": "e930", "commentid": "fd0bd3aca33f"}
