{"name": "478_1", "child": "", "content": "What I have learned over the decades is this: being aware of ourselves \u2014 what we feel, think, and how we act \u2014 is the most important part of parenting (and living) \u2014 in uncertain times. Be the person you want to be and you want your kids to be as well. Model for them what it is like to live fully and care about humanity. Show them, and tell them, about how humans adapt and survive and are inherently good. Show them and teach them how to live in the present. Most importantly, show them how to be the best human they possibly can be \u2014 one that makes mistakes, cares about people, and does the best they can every single day. These are the keys to their future and ours \u2014 and that is a certainty.", "title": "", "parent": "478", "creatorid": "23ad503e1e3c", "sentenceid": "5c9e", "commentid": "98144157803d"}
