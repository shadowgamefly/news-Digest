{"name": "116_2", "child": "", "content": "The Los Angeles Clippers: Three things here: (1) All that I want is to see Chris Paul, the greatest point guard of his generation and also one of the greatest point guards of all time, play in a couple of capital-H, capital-S High-Stakes playoff games. That\u2019s it. It really doesn\u2019t seem like so much to ask. (2) What do you think is going to be the insane, bizarre, terrible, devastating way that the Clippers are going to fall apart in the playoffs this year? Some sort of fluke game (\u201cBORIS DIAW SCORED 54 IN GAME 6?????\u201d)? A freak injury (\u201cBLAKE GRIFFIN GOT TEMPORARY AMNESIA????\u201d)? The team plane flies to the wrong city? (3) Despite the universe\u2019s apparent joy in dicking over the Clippers, I just can\u2019t find it in myself to put a team with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and J.J. Redick any lower than Group III in this index. They won 50 games this season. That\u2019s not a small number.*", "title": "", "parent": "116", "creatorid": "8ac7adbee04c", "sentenceid": "a805", "commentid": "5b6b6a1f9932"}
