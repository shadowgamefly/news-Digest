It really is just that simple. And this is all okay, because if we all thought the same way life would no longer be challenging and interesting and fun. Although I fiercely disagree with your presidency, policy, beliefs, and administration, I want to forget all that and just talk to you as one human being to another \u2014 just me and you.
