And at the end of it, he would actually get the right answer! But he usually wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. Once he\u2019d gotten the answer, he\u2019d go back and try to figure out why it was obvious. And often he\u2019d come up with one of those classic Feynman straightforward-sounding explanations. And he\u2019d never tell people about all the calculations behind it.
