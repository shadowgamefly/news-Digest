{"commentid": "788202b8af4a", "content": "In trying to learn more about feminism I began re-reading the most prominent feminist writers that I had read in my youth. I wanted to understand how my perception of these works had changed now that my attitude toward feminism has changed. At one time, I believed feminism was a cause for improving the lives of women, fighting for equal rights between men and women. Today my impression of feminism is more along the lines of seeing it as an ideology that is dead set on ruining the lives of men while celebrating only the women who support this ideology. Women who disagree with the competitive nature between feminism and men, who believe men and women have different gifts and are complementary, and women who love and admire men for their own gifts while wanting to develop her own feminine gifts to complement are dismissed, alienated and even attacked for questioning the authority of feminism.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "5e91", "parent": "63", "creatorid": "9224f1143c8f", "name": "63_1", "title": ""}
