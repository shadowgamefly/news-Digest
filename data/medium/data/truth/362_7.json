Magical creatures don\u2019t exist! If aliens exist, we don\u2019t know what they are like yet! Human history doesn\u2019t illuminate the history of fictional creatures. It\u2019s quite possible that an alien race might have a monoculture, and the creatures of actual mythology and folklore were often portrayed simplistically. The call to make make such races more complex is not to make them more \u201ctrue\u201d to the reality of dragons, Martians, or giant eagles. It is a call to make them more human, and thus more interesting to human readers.", "title": "", "parent": "362", "creatorid": "2621740a8063", "sentenceid": "0e4d", "commentid": "a6e4427c94a5"}
