{"name": "605_1", "child": "", "content": "We had a regularly scheduled board meeting on January 29th, 2015 and I knew I needed to make a decision and recommendation about our direction. Weighing heavily on my mind were the impact to our team and the fact that we had recently raised capital with a plan based on our consumer strategy. I was about to present a dramatically different perspective. In the meeting, I laid out the range of options to our board including my recommendation that we dramatically cut staff to reduce costs, exit the consumer business and change direction. The silence that followed my presentation felt like it lasted days. Our newest investor, Mark Flynn from GSV Capital, was the first to speak: \u201cwe invested in Lytro because we were excited about the potential of Light Field technology and believed in the team, not because we wanted to be in the consumer electronics business. If you think you have a better path, go make it happen.\u201d", "title": "", "parent": "605", "creatorid": "ebc487a3dd2", "sentenceid": "b085", "commentid": "eae4a69c3791"}
