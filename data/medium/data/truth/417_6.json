{"name": "417_6", "child": "", "content": "Enter Reid Hoffman. Hoffman earned his credentials over two decades of startup building and nurturing. He started the very first social networking website, Socialnet.com, back in 1997 when Mark Zuckerberg was still in middle school. He met Facebook\u2019s plucky founder before the kid dropped out of Harvard, and he helped broker the startup\u2019s first $500,000 investment (kicking in $40,000 of his own). He was a founding board member at PayPal, and helped start LinkedIn back when most execs thought the idea of exposing your little black book was career suicide. LinkedIn now lays claim to more than 400 million members. In 2010, Hoffman joined venture firm Greylock, managing a seed fund that has invested in Groupon, Dropbox, Pandora, Tumblr, Shopkick, and Airbnb, where he\u2019s a board observer. His list of for-profit and nonprofit board seats is lengthy.", "title": "", "parent": "417", "creatorid": "209207e81261", "sentenceid": "19ed", "commentid": "b78a9c191808"}
