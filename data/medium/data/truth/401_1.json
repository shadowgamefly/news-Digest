{"name": "401_1", "child": "", "content": "For my students, cyber school is a chance to receive an education in the way that best suits their needs. My students live all over the state of Pennsylvania in cities, the suburbs, and in rural areas. Some work, others are involved in sports or junior military training programs. Others volunteer in hospitals and museums. I once had a student, also a dancer, who traveled to New York with her mother\u2019s dance company regularly. She kept up with assignments and lessons she missed by watching the recordings of live classes and letting me know if she needed clarification. I have students who have gone on to the University of Colorado, New York University, Dartmouth College and Lehigh University. A current student asked me to write a letter of recommendation because she wants to attend the summer program offered by Harvard. She plans to go to an Ivy League school and pursue a career in law.", "title": "", "parent": "401", "creatorid": "d3b2b983d648", "sentenceid": "0f39", "commentid": "a33b92d1e243"}
