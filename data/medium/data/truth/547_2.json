She explained to me the difference between what I had (depression) and manic depression (bipolar disorder). She told me that Mike Wallace of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d had depression and that Carrie Fisher had manic depression, and that they both spoke openly about it to help people. I wasn\u2019t that into \u201cStar Wars\u201d yet, but I knew Carrie Fisher was famous and talented and pretty and I had thought she was very funny when somebody accidentally let me watch \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\u201d I remember as a kid I liked her voice. It was a very soothing voice, I thought. So elegant.", "title": "", "parent": "547", "creatorid": "7cac3012b540", "sentenceid": "e57b", "commentid": "172e2a27bbd6"}
