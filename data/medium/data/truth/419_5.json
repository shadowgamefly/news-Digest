{"name": "419_5", "child": "", "content": "Eero costs $199 for the first unit you buy, and you get a three-pack for $499. The white plastic is reminiscent of the original Airport, but the Eeros are flatter and more compact. Setup is done through the app and is pretty easy, though you do have to painstakingly reprogram the wifi on every device. I\u2019ve previously tried to address my apartment\u2019s deadest spot \u2014 the worst being the living room couch, which was at the farthest point in the living area from the cable modem, which, for reasons that escape me now, lives in the master bedroom \u2014 by installing an \u201cextender\u201d that picks up the signal from the router and essentially starts a new network to cover areas close to this second gadget. This second network only passes through about sixty percent of the signal you\u2019d get in the bedroom, which made for slow internet on the couch and jumpy video streamed from the Apple TV. Worse, the extender requires a different network name and password, and of the two networks now in my apartment, my computer always seems to get on the wrong one.", "title": "", "parent": "419", "creatorid": "cc7897264e8f", "sentenceid": "629d", "commentid": "d68b74fbb8da"}
