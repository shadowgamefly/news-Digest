{"name": "595_3", "child": "", "content": "Right now, looking at my laptop screen, I see a row of tight, fussy little icons below the Google doc I have open. This is the \u201cdeck\u201d on a Mac. I used to know these like my own five fingers, but that\u2019s when I only had five icons. Now there are \u2014 twenty? These represent the tips of the icebergs for the major tech players, and like ticker symbols, they all jostle uncomfortably for my attention. I used to think of Microsoft Word as the blue one, but now I see that Apple has seized various shades of what the humorist Delia Ephron disparages as \u201cbank blue,\u201d and the iMessage app (with cartoon talk bubbles) stands out in that shade, along with the Mail stamp-shaped icon, compass-shaped Safari, and protractor App Store. None of these has a word on them. They look maddeningly alike.", "title": "", "parent": "595", "creatorid": "5f10c1a7755c", "sentenceid": "5522", "commentid": "db715d5c5b98"}
