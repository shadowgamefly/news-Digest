In the season and a half since Tyronn Lue took over, his coach-player relationship with his friend LeBron has seemed healthy (or as normal as one can be with a GM who also starts at forward), even during last year\u2019s stressful playoffs. But the Cavaliers\u2019 first-round matchup is against the Pacers, with whom LeBron shares postseason beef. It seems all the less likely that the Cavs will get out of the gate smoothly, and when they don\u2019t, the grace period will be over.
