{"name": "33_3", "child": "", "content": "That is an Oscar Robertson highlight tape made by the NBA. I laughed while watching it, because every play is just a normal basketball play. The clip contains about 14 midrange jumpers, about three tightly contested layups, about three uncontested layups, a few (really nice!) passes, and some regular-looking rebounds. Average-ass plays were world-shaking highlights in the early NBA, and Robertson was a transcendent force.", "title": "", "parent": "33", "creatorid": "4d0e901abae1", "sentenceid": "3578", "commentid": "37b578db774d"}
