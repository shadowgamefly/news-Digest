You made me come and scream at the feel of the tectonic plates moving and introducing me to the old lands and gods, I came to the edge of the world, to where the sun and the earth tilted at another axis. I came and saw how the universe become, I saw it from the ashes, and ashes I was, until you cried out my name, I was reborn.", "title": "", "parent": "368", "creatorid": "b93f1d7c209a", "sentenceid": "5fd5", "commentid": "ccadfe703d27"}
