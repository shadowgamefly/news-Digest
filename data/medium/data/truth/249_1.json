{"name": "249_1", "child": "", "content": "Biggest off-court challenge: If there are stories surrounding Oregon this week, they likely have to do with shooting guard Tyler Dorsey and forward Jordan Bell comprising one hell of an NBA Jam duo throughout this tournament. This is obviously great news for the Ducks. It\u2019s just that the explosion of those two guys comes at an interesting time, as on Tuesday Pac-12 Player of the Year Dillon Brooks was named an AP second-team All-American. The concern for Dana Altman is that a power struggle might unfold against North Carolina, where Brooks forces the action in an attempt to reclaim his throne as Oregon\u2019s alpha dog. And no, I don\u2019t have reason to believe that Brooks is petty enough to worry about bullshit like that when a national title is on the line. But it\u2019s human nature to have some ego, and Brooks might feel like he has to carry the team anyway, as he figures to be matched up with a Carolina big all game, while Dorsey could have Justin Jackson, who is four inches taller than he is, draped all over him.", "title": "", "parent": "249", "creatorid": "274dc8fe6d56", "sentenceid": "30dd", "commentid": "569d87ef846c"}
