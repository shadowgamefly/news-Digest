{"name": "116_1", "child": "", "content": "The Houston Rockets: The Rockets are one of the three most interesting teams in the playoffs this year for four different reasons: (1) The Rockets are making 3s at a historic clip (over 14 per game), and we\u2019ve already seen the Warriors shred the \u201cjump-shooting teams can\u2019t win championships\u201d thing, so who\u2019s to say the Rockets can\u2019t do it, too, what with them being even more jump-shoot-y than the Warriors have ever been. (2) James Harden, who was a human walking sigh by the end of last season, has been exquisite this season (averaging 29\u20138\u201311). And he\u2019s already mad that he\u2019s going to lose the MVP to Russell Westbrook, which means you can expect him to be at his absolute destruct-o-pettiest during the Rockets-Thunder first-round matchup. (3) Mike D\u2019Antoni is headed toward a second-round matchup against Gregg Popovich, and I just want to point that out in case you forgot that behind just about every great war is two wealthy white men trying to poke each other in the eye. And (4) THAT SAID, is anyone really afraid of the Rockets past the second round?*", "title": "", "parent": "116", "creatorid": "a0cfe16cc37e", "sentenceid": "02c6", "commentid": "338b10519253"}
