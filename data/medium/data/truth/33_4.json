Late in the first half, like a Street Fighter character going for a combo score, Randle elbowed the unsuspecting grills of Ryan Anderson (bloodied lip), James Harden (bemused beard), and Clint Capela (sore jaw) in one John Wick\u2013like sequence. A minute later he went upside Montrezl Harrell\u2019s dome. Randle had 30 points and eight rebounds through three quarters and the gap narrowed ominously to single digits. So Walton subbed him out with three minutes left in the third. The lead quickly ballooned to 18 and the tank rolled on.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "bcbe", "parent": "33", "creatorid": "c088d31b3736", "name": "33_4", "title": ""}
