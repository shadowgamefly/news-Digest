{"name": "1773_3", "child": "", "content": "Propaganda is notoriously difficult to define. Beyond the generally agreed upon principle that propaganda involves some effort at persuasion, it\u2019s hard to settle on clear boundaries on what counts as propaganda. Communication scholar Philip M. Taylor briefly defines propaganda as \u201cthe deliberate attempt to persuade people to think and behave in a desired way\u201d (2003, p.6). Philosopher Jason Stanley lists a variety of definitions, including the \u201cclassical\u201d sense of \u201cmanipulation of the rational will to close off debate\u201d (2015, p. 48). Stanley focuses in particular on supporting propaganda, which bolsters certain favored ideals but does so by nonrational means, and undermining propaganda, which presents itself as bolstering favored ideals but in fact \u201ctends to erode those very ideals\u201d (p. 53). These are only two examples, differing on many points but tied together in their attention to power and persuasion.", "title": "", "parent": "1773", "creatorid": "8bfc99121ab3", "sentenceid": "b076", "commentid": "b25c39fda2f9"}
