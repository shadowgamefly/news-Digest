It\u2019s a story about a young kid who\u2019s searching for meaning in life. Way better than all the corny self-help parables like The Alchemist. This book is down to earth and fun to read.", "title": "", "parent": "308", "creatorid": "69ef31ed98e8", "sentenceid": "6ec5", "commentid": "5122521c091"}
