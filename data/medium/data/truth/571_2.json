{"name": "571_2", "child": "", "content": "I haven\u2019t been writing as much, lately. When I do write, I\u2019m afraid to share. I used to be brazen with a pen. I sometimes possess an amazing capacity to speak without inhibition \u2014 and to do it with conviction, despite my insecurities. But not lately. Lately, I filter everything through the part of my head that anticipates reactions and counter reactions and then reactions to counter reactions. I\u2019ve been letting the comments get to me. The comments, the tweets, the emails, the mentions, the blog posts, the abuse. I say let, but it doesn\u2019t feel much like a choice. People tell me it\u2019s a choice. They say: look at all the nice things people are saying. Think about that. Don\u2019t think about that. Don\u2019t let them win. Don\u2019t let it get to you. That\u2019s what they want. \n \n I\u2019ve been trying to think about what I want. I guess what I\u2019ve always sought is the ability to be at home in myself \u2014 to not feel like I am sitting in a chair surrounded by the fortress of my body, living a life that no one is willing to connect with. I write to not feel like a ghost. Or, to tell the other ghosts that there is someone else haunting her couch, and sometimes the world, wailing a tune that harmonizes with theirs. I am vulnerable. I am not some Strong Black Woman archetype who has made peace with the bad parts of her life and is trying to save the world with them, now. I am just a person with a borrowed laptop, trying to prove to myself that I am real, that the things that have happened to me are real. \n \nI am spilling my guts here. I am unearthing buried things. I do not have a lot of this shit processed. I don\u2019t know that I ever will. I am in a lifelong struggle with an inner voice that is cruel and degrading and destructive. It is lofty enough to shut that part of me out. It is doubly difficult to shut out the voices of strangers echoing the awfulness. An angry mob arrives in my inbox like an alarm blaring: You are not real. Your suffering is not real. All the bad things were good. You should be grateful for your trauma. Shut up. You are too broken to function. We feel sorry for the people who know you. You have fucked up your life. We do not care. We do not care.", "title": "", "parent": "571", "creatorid": "c0d0bb41517e", "sentenceid": "7bee", "commentid": "f36ce0fb28f3"}
