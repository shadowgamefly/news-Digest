{"name": "1756_1", "child": "", "content": "The rub is that even if streaming is replacing radio, it\u2019s also eating away at album and single sales at the same time without offering artists the same amount of compensation. That\u2019s why Taylor Swift ditched Spotify and why Adele waited months to put 25 on streaming services. From a financial standpoint, Jay\u2019s moves make sense. He\u2019s probably earning a pittance from his back catalog on streaming services, and shoring up the catalog of Tidal could help him attract even more investors. Sprint recently bought a 33 percent stake in the company, effectively dashing any dreams that the streaming wars for exclusive content will end anytime soon.", "title": "", "parent": "1756", "creatorid": "a33a72c1510b", "sentenceid": "869a", "commentid": "fd3b88fe18f9"}
