{"name": "665_1", "child": "", "content": "I have to interrupt my story here to tell you how I came up with the name Rivershark. I actually didn\u2019t; my son did. Remember when I told you we spent Saturdays walking down by the Mississippi River? I\u2019m a rambler if you let me and so I was always talking with him. He would point to things in the river and want to know what they were. When I knew, I would tell him \u2014 that is a tugboat, a barge, a floating log, a cadaver \u2014 but when I didn\u2019t, it became a rivershark. And then it was his job to tell me where that rivershark came from, where he was going and what he was going to do on his trip down the river. I would fill in details about the river like the fact that Mark Twain was in St. Louis and he piloted steam boats. He would include these little tidbits in his stories until they become these intricate narratives of one shark\u2019s journey down the river.", "title": "", "parent": "665", "creatorid": "e1924bab9e2d", "sentenceid": "652a", "commentid": "56165d1ceb33"}
