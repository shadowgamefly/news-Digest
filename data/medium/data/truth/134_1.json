There is a little bit more trust in my thoughtfulness, but I know it wasn\u2019t the same for every player. There are teams like the Dolphins where the owner has the organization rise [for the anthem], there\u2019s teams like San Francisco who backed Colin Kaepernick fully and matched his donation of a million dollars [to local charities]. Then there\u2019s other ones who, I won\u2019t put any names to it, are really good friends with our president and are on the opposite end of that. So, it\u2019s hard for me to tell guys on different teams in different positions how to navigate this environment, because it changes depending on which team you\u2019re on.\u201d", "title": "", "parent": "134", "creatorid": "37a6abd97c37", "sentenceid": "4207", "commentid": "7a25f6bd3b10"}
