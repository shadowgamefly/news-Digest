{"name": "605_2", "child": "", "content": "Then, things started to get tough. First, the dot com crash effectively closed the capital markets. We were the last tech company of that era to go public in March of 2001. Shortly after our IPO, we laid off 33% of our company. Mass bankruptcies of many of our startup customers followed which left us holding the bag on expensive long-term server and data center leases. We were burning $40MM of cash per quarter with no way to put additional capital into the company. Then 9/11 happened, which only accelerated the downward spiral of the whole market. Another round of layoffs followed. Through a small miracle, we were on the verge of being able to raise some additional capital through a vehicle known as a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity). A few days before we were supposed to close, our largest customer went bankrupt itself. This was a material event for the company which in turn killed our PIPE. A third round of layoffs followed.", "title": "", "parent": "605", "creatorid": "79665331d85a", "sentenceid": "c047", "commentid": "93108c510b2f"}
