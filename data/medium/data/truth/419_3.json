I was greeted by its CEO Fahri Diner and a group of technicians. Diner, born in Cyprus but a Silicon Valley resident since 2002, has a long background in wireless tech. \u201cI am one of the guys who brought broadband to your home,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I needed to finish the job.\u201d Diner gave me the lowdown on his product, which differs from Eero and many of the other meshers in that much of the actual digital work of a usual router is off-loaded to the cloud. As companies like Eero move us from a one-router world to a three-router world, Diner says Plume\u2019s solution is a \u201czero-router world.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s free: You still need compact base units that sell for $69 each (a three-pack is $179, a six-pack $329), and Plume estimates that a large home might use as many as twelve units. In any case, having the router in the cloud enables more computation, so that Plume\u2019s distant servers can constantly calculate the best configuration of devices and even switch frequency channels when they detect a conflict with nearby networks. Diner calls it \u201cadaptive wifi.\u201d", "title": "", "parent": "419", "creatorid": "1a84e29b81aa", "sentenceid": "d9de", "commentid": "7c79dc689c9e"}
