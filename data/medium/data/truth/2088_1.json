{"child": "", "sentenceid": "80da", "content": "Chris Ryan: I am inside the NBA Cerebro right now, and when I look at the San Antonio Spurs, I get real 2010\u201311 vibrations. Both were 61-win teams with veteran frontcourts (swap Tim Duncan and Antonio McDyess for LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol). Both had great net ratings (second this year, third in 2010\u201311) and cruised through the regular season only to face Memphis in the playoffs. In 2011, the Spurs lost to the Grizz in six games, becoming only the second 1-seed to lose to an 8-seed since the switch to a best-of-seven first round. Could history (sort of) repeat itself? I don\u2019t think this Grizz team has the same mythical vibe (no O.J. Mayo, for starters), but I do think this Spurs team is beatable. The underlying numbers \u2014 best defense, top-10 offense \u2014 suggest title contender, but I still haven\u2019t gotten over them blowing that 22-point lead to the Warriors at home at the end of March.", "creatorid": "c088d31b3736", "parent": "2088", "name": "2088_1", "title": "", "commentid": "d30e18a4323a"}
