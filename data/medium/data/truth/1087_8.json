{"name": "1087_8", "child": "", "content": "I started reading about syntax of Perl and started understanding some of the common patterns of the language. Now, I really wanted to build something using Perl so that I could apply my knowledge of the language and practice various concepts of the language. While I was looking for ideas to build something in Perl, I came across DuckDuckGo\u2019s open source organization on GitHub. I noticed that some of the open projects were written in Perl. I had a look at the issues and found a lot of \u201cbeginner\u201d issues. I immediately started working on them and submitted a couple of pull requests. Fast forward to today, I am one of the main contributors for a couple of their open projects and also one of the 20 Open Source Community Leaders for DuckDuckGo.", "title": "", "parent": "1087", "creatorid": "ac5b2eccfd7c", "sentenceid": "47d1", "commentid": "b49ca4502e31"}
