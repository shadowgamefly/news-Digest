{"name": "605_3", "child": "", "content": "We began to hear regularly from prospective customers that they weren\u2019t interested in our cloud services. In their minds we were on a certain path to bankruptcy. But it wasn\u2019t all bad news: they were very interested in buying the software we had developed to automate the operations of our own data centers, called Opsware. It took us a while before the penny dropped, but we finally understood. We needed to stop selling cloud services and sell Opsware technology to large enterprises instead. This realization and pivot was only possible thanks the the incredible foresight of our CEO, Ben Horowitz, and the deal making skills of our head of business development, John O\u2019Farrell, who together sold our cloud business to EDS for $65MM and simultaneously signed EDS up as our first and largest customer for Opsware.", "title": "", "parent": "605", "creatorid": "37bf89bee3f7", "sentenceid": "3f12", "commentid": "2a8db5f37ee"}
