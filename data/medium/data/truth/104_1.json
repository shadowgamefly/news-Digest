{"content": "As we began working on projects of larger scale and greater complexity, we made significant improvements to our platform, especially our project administration tools. Working closely with the San Francisco Planning Department, we designed and built plan scenarios, segmentation surveys, anonymous participation, and new mapping capabilities. We kept our house clean with the latest in internet security, improved uptime, and built several new layout templates based on our partners\u2019 needs. We integrated spatial data from ArcGIS, Google Fusion Tables, and MySidewalk. And we made it easier to export complex sets of data (cross-tabbed spreadsheets) from Neighborland for data analysts. We updated our product guide to explain all of all of our new capabilities and configurations in detail.", "sentenceid": "5614", "creatorid": "18500700d592", "title": "", "parent": "104", "child": "", "name": "104_1", "commentid": "a5c63cc511c8"}
