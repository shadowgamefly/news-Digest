{"name": "1772_2", "child": "", "content": "As a huge proponent for media literacy for over a decade, I\u2019m struggling with the ways in which I missed the mark. The reality is that my assumptions and beliefs do not align with most Americans. Because of my privilege as a scholar, I get to see how expert knowledge and information is produced and have a deep respect for the strengths and limitations of scientific inquiry. Surrounded by journalists and people working to distribute information, I get to see how incentives shape information production and dissemination and the fault lines of that process. I believe that information intermediaries are important, that honed expertise matters, and that no one can ever be fully informed. As a result, I have long believed that we have to outsource certain matters and to trust others to do right by us as individuals and society as a whole. This is what it means to live in a democracy, but, more importantly, it\u2019s what it means to live in a society.", "title": "", "parent": "1772", "creatorid": "3900de9d1c2e", "sentenceid": "65b4", "commentid": "14cfacd64e31"}
