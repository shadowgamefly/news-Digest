{"commentid": "5576f5e5db8b", "content": "Kevin O\u2019Connor: In only five of the 33 years since the NBA switched to a 16-team playoff format have all four of the top seeds advanced in each conference. It occurred in 1986, 1997, 2002, 2004, and 2008. Every other season had at least one upset. I\u2019m predicting that for the first time since 2008, all eight of the top seeds will win their first-round series. I have little doubt the Celtics, Cavaliers, Raptors, and Wizards all will advance in the East. The Warriors and Spurs will take care of business. The Rockets outscored the Thunder by only 2.3 points per 100 possessions this season, but Houston has more firepower, so they should come out on top. Clippers-Jazz is the series I\u2019m most unsure of. But the Clippers are playing elite basketball with Chris Paul, and they have home-court advantage, so they\u2019re my choice. I\u2019m ready for a playoff in which we see the best of the best duel it out deep into the postseason.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "a19f", "parent": "2", "creatorid": "99a5dbde3bfb", "name": "2_3", "title": ""}
