{"name": "1883_5", "child": "", "content": "Having reflected on this experience for several months, I would issue two challenges. The first to the people who feel like they are currently being mistreated within a work culture of white normativity. I challenge you to speak up when you feel someone has stepped outside their professional boundaries. I challenge you to communicate as best as you can when you feel you have been mistreated. Don\u2019t apologize for feeling this way. Stop worrying so much about respectability that you quietly allow yourself to be disrespected. If none of these things work and you can honestly say that you handled yourself professionally and with honor \u2014 then I challenge you to quit. If your employer has a severance policy, rather than quit, I challenge you to find a way to get fired so that you can get that severance check first.", "title": "", "parent": "1883", "creatorid": "3943bd6b10ae", "sentenceid": "3878", "commentid": "e05cfa35e274"}
