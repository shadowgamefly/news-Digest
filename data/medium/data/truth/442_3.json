One starts from a script \u2014 an overall specification of what one wants the finished product to be like. Then one actually tries to build it. Then, inevitably, at the end when one looks at what one has, one realizes one has to change the specification. In movies like Arrival, that\u2019s post-production. In software, it\u2019s more an iteration of the development process.", "title": "", "parent": "442", "creatorid": "b64c30a3373b", "sentenceid": "a8d4", "commentid": "a8971090d785"}
