It was quite a difficult intro course in Java, but I loved spending countless hours completing the assignments. During lectures, however, my self-doubt would creep back in. I looked around at all the people in my class, most of whom were male, and many of whom I assumed were like my STWing peers, coding since they were wee tots. I occasionally thought back to my HTML/CSS background \u2014 I guess I had been coding for a long time, too \u2026 but this seemed different. These were kids who had built robots, who understood how to make apps \u2026they were \u201creal coders\u201d. My mind had created an impenetrable block that forever deemed myself \u201cnot a real coder\u201d, and so no matter how many men I outperformed on the test curve or project scores, I always felt inferior.", "creatorid": "e75bf7b9f175", "child": "", "sentenceid": "85af"}
