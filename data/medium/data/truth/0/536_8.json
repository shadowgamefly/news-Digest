As long as there has been Whiteness there has been white women, and therefore people of color affected by our violence, and therefore art created to reflect those experiences. When I think of earlier examples, I think of Waiting to Exhale, Girlfriends, and The Fresh Prince. The topic of white women\u2019s racism was often in the context of romantic relationships, a mostly toothless joke, or revealed almost in code: a white female character who, to those who know the code, is acting out racist microaggressions, but to a clueless white audience might allow the interpretation of \u201cjust a nasty person who just happened to be a white woman.\u201d One example of this that comes to mind is the famous 1991 \u201cBig Four-Oh\u201d episode of Fresh Prince in which Aunt Viv is faced with two snotty white girls in a dance class who automatically underestimate her ability to keep up, and who she shuts down with a flawless execution of the choreography.", "creatorid": "4801d5e23400", "child": "", "sentenceid": "789f"}
