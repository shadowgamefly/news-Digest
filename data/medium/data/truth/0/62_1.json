He averaged 27.3 points (on 45.5 percent shooting), 7.6 rebounds, and 4.3 assists against the Raptors, taking his game to a completely different level than in the regular season. George has gotten the better of LeBron at points in their three playoff matchups when James was in Miami, but he has never been able to get past him in a series. While the Pacers almost certainly aren\u2019t good enough to knock off the Cavs, George can make a statement about his place in the NBA hierarchy with a strong showing against LeBron. Barring an unlikely playoff run by Giannis Antetokounmpo or Jimmy Butler, George is the best wing LeBron will face until a possible Finals series against Kevin Durant. That alone should get his competitive juices flowing. There\u2019s no more rationing energy or saving himself. The best player in the world is squaring off against a legitimate challenger to the throne.", "creatorid": "c088d31b3736", "child": "", "sentenceid": "4984"}
