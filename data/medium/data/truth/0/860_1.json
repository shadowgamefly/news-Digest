However, I have left the most important topic out of this list: You enjoy what you are doing. If you don\u2019t enjoy learning everyday about computer science and software development, you will never become a senior developer because you won\u2019t have the drive to be better over the long term. If you have ever read So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You you understand that passion has been over-hyped. The real passion comes after you have mastered a skill. You have worked hard to become proficient and a leader in a field.

That\u2019s how you develop passion for work that you do.", "creatorid": "57fe498d4d48", "child": "", "sentenceid": "47a5"}
