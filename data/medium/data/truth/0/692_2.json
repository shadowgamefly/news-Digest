When I\u2019ve taught fiction classes, I\u2019ve often seen that when students encounter a book outside of the modes of actual realism or faux worldbuilding realism, they don\u2019t know how to evaluate it. They believe that a different way of seeing reality aren\u2019t invitations to see reality in a new way yourself, but simply failures of worldbuilding.", "creatorid": "2621740a8063", "child": "", "sentenceid": "aba5"}
