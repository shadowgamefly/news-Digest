Barkley (25\u201312\u20134, 60% FG, 53 wins) garnered more first-place votes than Magic while playing for a mediocre Sixers team; he may have bested Magic if we\u2019d have known about Barkley\u2019s 66.1 true shooting percentage (????), 17.3 win shares, 27.1 PER, and 128 offensive rating. And MJ averaged a 33\u20137\u20136, dominated every advanced metric that we never knew about, and played his usual world-class defense on a 55-win Bulls team \u2026 only the idiotic \u201cMichael doesn\u2019t know how to make his teammates better\u201d mainstream media backlash had blossomed into full-fledged ignorance.
