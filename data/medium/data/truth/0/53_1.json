Sometimes he still struggles with his choice of shots and appears to be a chucker on some possessions, but I have noticed him trying to get his teammates involved more and more. His rebounding numbers have always been solid but it seems like he has been more willing to bang around with the big men down low to get a rebound. Having offensive weapons like Kristaps Porzingis and Derrick Rose has helped \u2018Melo be less of a one-dimensional player.", "creatorid": "400751481c5a", "child": "", "sentenceid": "dada"}
