David Lee got loose inside, putting San Antonio up four with a whirling layup, and then Anderson blocked Buddy Hield\u2019s wild layup attempt, the kind of shot that Sacramento lived off of in the first half. Patty Mills hit back-to-back jumpers (a 3, then a 2-pointer plus the foul). Then it was Danny Green\u2019s turn to hurl consecutive daggers. The 114\u2013104 win was San Antonio\u2019s 50th of the season, making this the 18th consecutive year the Spurs have reached the half-century mark.
