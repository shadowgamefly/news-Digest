It was Republicans that pushed through the bills that unshackled lobbyists and lifted limits on corporate campaign contributions. It was the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that upheld Citizens United. And nothing the modern Democratic Party has done comes close to the conniving voter disenfranchisement efforts that Republicans continue to pursue. From draconian voter ID laws and a racially-biased criminal justice system, to electoral district gerrymandering, the GOP has cemented an unfair advantage that makes it very difficult for Democrats to compete at the polls.
