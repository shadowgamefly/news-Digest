The closest we have to the Nazi mentality here is the intolerance of the left. A freely elected president by the people, although, sad for the left should be accepted flat out. Is that what the left is doing? No! They are sheep being lead by communist influencers like George Soros and Obama who are literally paying anarchists to be violent. That is what happened in Germany during the Nazi regime. College professors giving lower grade to students who don\u2019t hide their non liberal beliefs while other college professors are harassed by the faculty for not being one of them. Public schools who spend more time on gender identification and bullying than teaching math. this is the kind of brainwashing that took place during Nazi regimes.
