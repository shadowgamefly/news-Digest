Firing Hennigan is an understandable decision. The team has won an average of 26.4 games since he was hired in 2012. They have nothing to show for the 2012 Dwight Howard blockbuster. The Tobias Harris trade is still hard to decipher. Mario Hezonja looks like a bust (though I still have hope). Elfrid Payton has not worked out yet. They\u2019ve hired three head coaches in five years. The Magic are an idle franchise that\u2019s neither moved forward nor backward.", "creatorid": "4d0e901abae1", "child": "", "sentenceid": "4191"}
