This is a technique that was long used by human reporters in the days when truth was central to the news. A story, however juicy, would never be reported on the evidence of a single source. (The movie All the President\u2019s Men, about the reporting of the Watergate scandal, made a powerful impression on me as a young man, as have many interactions with first rate reporters in stories that I myself have been involved in over the years since.) The Huffington Post\u2019s \u2018Booed Like Crazy\u2019 was a quote from a tweet about the event. How many tweets were there from audience members reporting booing? How many reported cheering, or a mix of cheering and booing? Again, searching for multiple confirming sources is something that computers can do very well.", "creatorid": "8107fa9814ba", "child": "", "sentenceid": "e6d7"}
