He wrote Vampire in Brooklyn, and had a handful of smaller film roles \u2014 the 1989 (black people) classic Harlem Nights, Spike Lee\u2019s Mo\u2019 Better Blues, Ice Cube\u2019s The Players Club \u2014 as well as a few one-off TV roles in shows like Black Dynamite and Black Jesus. But a personal favorite was Murphy\u2019s work on The Boondocks as a white and profoundly bizarre Iraq War vet named Ed Wuncler III who tended toward the extreme in all walks of life. There\u2019s a scene in the second season where he snatches up and interrogates the wrong schoolkid over Riley\u2019s missing chain. \u201cWELL FUCK YOU THEN\u201d isn\u2019t especially funny on its own, but the subtle tonal changes of the brief, genuine apology that precedes it and the sudden veer into full-on shouting illustrate Murphy\u2019s draw. It\u2019s not what he said but how he said it that held your attention and popped into your head at random for some time afterward:", "creatorid": "30ee66f178af", "child": "", "sentenceid": "37a9"}
