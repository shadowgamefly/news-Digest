Not so with the white women in Issa\u2019s organization \u201cWe Got You\u201d in HBO\u2019s Insecure. The white women she works with could very well be the white women watching the show from their couches, and while Insecure is doing amazing numbers \u2014 and not just with Black audiences \u2014 I saw more than a few passive aggressive tweets from white women on Twitter expressing disinterest in the weeks prior to Insecure\u2019s release. It\u2019s a fascinating balance that begs analysis. We know white people are enthralled by Blackness. It\u2019s why we steal Black styles and Black speech and Black dances, all of which we gleefully co-opt and poorly imitate. Whether it\u2019s a question of entitlement, or a question of our own empty culture, the white fascination (and even obsession) with Blackness is undeniable. Yet studies have shown that white moviegoers are less interested in films in which Black actors star in leading roles, which more often than not translates into \u201cBlack movies,\u201d that is, movies made by and for Black audiences. I suspect that this is partially a white preference for Black characters told through a white storyteller\u2019s lens. We like our version of Black people better: the one we can control, the one that lacks context because context requires understanding when all we really want is entertainment. White creators who write two-dimensional characters of color do so for many reasons. Laziness. Incompetency. Ignorance. And also because anything more might contain a mirror \u2014 of us \u2014 and we want to look at something that doesn\u2019t look back.", "creatorid": "4801d5e23400", "child": "", "sentenceid": "e002"}
