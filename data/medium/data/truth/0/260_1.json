And, in theory, having these experts aiding its efforts behind the scenes should be helpful. But amid all these partnerships and experiments, a fog has emerged as to what, if any, effect Facebook\u2019s efforts are having on its users. For every headline we\u2019ve read about a new initiative to combat fake news, the measurement tools and statistics to follow up on their success have been absent. First Draft\u2019s tips to avoid spreading false information were harmless, but how many people even clicked through that link atop their News Feed to reach them? If they clicked, how many seconds did they spend on that imageless, videoless, colorless Help Center page? Now that the campaign has ended, why is it so difficult to manually search for those tips on the platform? Facebook might have this information, but it hasn\u2019t shared it with the public at large. So we have no way of knowing whether these campaigns are simply paying lip service to an issue or actively improving it.", "creatorid": "30ee66f178af", "child": "", "sentenceid": "58b3"}
