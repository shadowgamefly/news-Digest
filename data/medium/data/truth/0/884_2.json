There are parts of me I knew were there, but went ignored and neglected. Parts I either didn\u2019t think were worth developing, or didn\u2019t have to courage to develop. Parts I thought were weak, that I tried to cover up and hide. Now my heart is in hands that treat it with more care and kindness I allowed myself to give it. It\u2019s these parts that are now exposed. But instead of the injuries I feared, I feel them growing strong and proud. I am now wondering why I ever tried to hide those away.", "creatorid": "9d956a9b2b57", "child": "", "sentenceid": "3a66"}
