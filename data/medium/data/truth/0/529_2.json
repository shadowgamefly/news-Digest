Our fellow citizens are as smart as we are, and they are not mistaken when they see a media that condescends to them and their values of patriotism, religion, community, natural recreation, and hard work. They are neglected often enough to read the clear suggestion that they are best left as consumers than as a topic of conversation. Yet I believe I am not the only one who would rather read stories about salt miners in upstate New York and Iowa farmers too happy to retire than about the sale of another celebrity\u2019s Los Angeles mansion. Polarization depends on us failing to recognize our shared values, and a media that continues on as it does will only set itself up for further vilification.", "creatorid": "b7aeb8837ec0", "child": "", "sentenceid": "ea80"}
