But what I\u2019m saying is that, I mean, it just makes things a little less interesting as an observer. It\u2019s fantastic to watch the Warriors when they get into their Total Team Destruction mode and do something silly like have 38 assists on 45 shots for the game or whatever. That\u2019s great and beautiful basketball, obviously. It\u2019s just that sometimes I miss a good Kevin Durant iso, you know what I\u2019m saying? I miss him getting the ball, staring at the defense, then deciding, \u201cYou know what? Let me fuck up y\u2019all\u2019s life for the next few minutes,\u201d and then going berserk, like he did to my beloved Spurs in Game 4 of their 2012 series when he scored 16 points in a row over a five-minute stretch.", "creatorid": "622130b13bb4", "child": "", "sentenceid": "0b7c"}
