There were names and dates to recite, events to put in order, and people to do long reports about. Sapiens is the history textbook I wish I had instead \u2014 rich, fascinating, thought-provoking, and a love letter to why understanding the past helps us better understand our present and future. There are a thousand wonderful things I learned from this book, but the one I think about every day is the power of narratives and how our collective ability as humans to invent and believe these narratives made us the powerhouse species we are today.", "creatorid": "67d8995bd82a", "child": "", "sentenceid": "6c66"}
