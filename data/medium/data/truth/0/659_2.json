Nick Butcher\u2019s jump through animation, Bartek Lipinski\u2019s hamburger menu, and Miroslaw Stanek\u2019s Twitter heart demonstrate just how difficult and time consuming it can be to re-create animations from scratch. With Lottie, digging through frameworks for reference, guessing durations, manually creating B\u00e9zier curves, and re-making animations with nothing more than a GIF for reference will be a thing of the past. Now engineers can use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made. To demonstrate that, we\u2019ve recreated their animations and provided After Effects and JSON files of each in our sample app.", "creatorid": "6742aa576f9f", "child": "", "sentenceid": "27eb"}
