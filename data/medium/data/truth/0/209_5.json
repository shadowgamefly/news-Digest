Loe is from Norway, and I like his minimal style. It\u2019s a story about a young kid who\u2019s searching for meaning in life. Way better than all the corny self-help parables like The Alchemist. This book is down to earth and fun to read.", "creatorid": "69ef31ed98e8", "child": "", "sentenceid": "6ec5"}
