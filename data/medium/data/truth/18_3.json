It\u2019s taught me more about story structure than any other resource, including my undergraduate and graduate work in creative writing. It\u2019s a step-by-step guide through the classic hero\u2019s journey with examples and exercises that will improve your writing if you pay attention. My free course The Plotting Workshop is based on The Writer\u2019s Journey.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "9c2c", "parent": "18", "creatorid": "9bdec8be9bb5", "name": "18_3", "title": ""}
