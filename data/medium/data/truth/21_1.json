{"content": "Ludacris replaced Ja Rule: Ja was asked to be in 2 Fast 2 Furious after he was in The Fast and the Furious but he turned it down because this was back in the early 2000s and he was still famous and successful then. That\u2019s how Ludacris ended up in this and the subsequent movies. Two things about that move: (1) I wonder how often Ja thinks about that. He\u2019d made $15,000 for his appearance in the original and they offered him $500,000 to be in the second one. That means he\u2019d be making several million per movie now instead of working at Chick-Fil-A or wherever it is he\u2019s working now. (2) Ja losing his spot to Luda was a great turn for the franchise. They have completely different energies. Ja was always gruffer, meaner, tougher. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d have been able to slide into the tech guy role that Luda plays so perfectly. It\u2019d have to have been a whole different thing.", "sentenceid": "a58a", "creatorid": "fec37dc46a38", "title": "", "parent": "21", "child": "", "name": "21_1", "commentid": "add6f07714ed"}
