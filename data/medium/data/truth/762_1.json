One should not be spewing \u201cdouble standard\u201d left and right because someone new starts in your area. Alas, that is my fate. Not only do they have a bug up their ass about me personally, but they have found a way to piss off nearly everyone around them. The first time the new person yelled at me about my training techniques they should have been sent home. Why my employer is allowing them to train on overtime when we barely have work to do is a complete mystery. I am drained. I enter the building with my guard up. I feel helpless. I am pissed off a good fifty percent of the day, and it\u2019s all related to this one recent hire.", "title": "", "parent": "762", "creatorid": "1a63cf04da58", "sentenceid": "bc6b", "commentid": "371b048e451e"}
