{"name": "1756_2", "child": "", "content": "Aaliyah is an extreme example, but more and more we\u2019re finding that the unwillingness of some artists (or their managers) to allow their music to proliferate online butts up against our modern notion that media should be easy to access at all times. The eulogizing of Prince last year on social media was made difficult because he fastidiously kept his music off the digital platforms where people congregate. Kanye West created a spectacle and a pretty good meme around the Tidal-exclusive The Life of Pablo, but none of the tracks ultimately achieved the ubiquity of his previous work. Meanwhile, Drake has been flooding every crevice of the internet with pop hits for what feels like a decade now. After a short stint as an Apple exclusive, 2016\u2019s Views arrived on all the major streaming platforms and has sold the equivalent of 2 million albums from digital spins alone. This year\u2019s More Life got a wide release from the start and is already breaking Views\u2019 records.", "title": "", "parent": "1756", "creatorid": "5d1c6ca93c65", "sentenceid": "e6f8", "commentid": "f4db18dfffe4"}
