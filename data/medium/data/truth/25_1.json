{"commentid": "a831bafaf743", "content": "Jason Concepcion: If Russell Westbrook doesn\u2019t win the MVP award, future generations will look back and wonder how we took leave of our senses. The context \u2014 James Harden\u2019s win shares, the Rockets\u2019 record, Westbrook\u2019s high usage rate, Kawhi\u2019s two-way punch \u2014 will fall away with the intervening years. What will remain is this: RUSSELL WESTBROOK AVERAGED A TRIPLE-DOUBLE FOR AN ENTIRE SEASON AND DIDN\u2019T WIN THE MVP. That\u2019s the headline that will travel across the ages. Russ, as you know, broke Oscar\u2019s 55-year-old single-season triple-double record, something once considered impossible. He\u2019s a basketball Paul Bunyan, a giant, walking the earthly plane, cutting down entire forests by himself. At one time, up to only a few weeks ago, I was pretty sure the MVP was James Harden. Some part of me still leans that way. But Russ convinced me. Basically by grabbing me around the neck and refusing to let go until I say \u201cYou are the MVP,\u201d whether I really believe it or not. So that\u2019s it. Westbrook is the MVP. You can let go now.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "80f4", "parent": "25", "creatorid": "54d20ab189ac", "name": "25_1", "title": ""}
