{"child": "", "title": "", "content": "1993: After Phoenix stole Charles Barkley from the hapless Sixers, the Chuckster won our hearts on the \u201992 Dream Team, then averaged a 26\u201312\u20135 on a charming 62-win Suns team. (If small-ball NBA offenses were video game systems, the \u201993 Suns were Nintendo, Nash\u2019s Suns were PlayStation, and Curry\u2019s Warriors were Xbox One). The mainstream media had turned on an increasingly salty MJ (two straight MVPs, two straight rings, and six straight killer seasons, so his 33\u20137\u20136, 57 wins and first-team All-Defense somehow felt mundane), and they definitely weren\u2019t excited about Hakeem\u2019s outrageous Rockets season (26\u201313\u20134, 53% FG, 150 steals, 342 blocks, 55 wins, the best two-way center since Kareem) or Patrick Ewing anchoring Riley\u2019s almost-champ Bully Ball Knicks (24\u201312, 60 wins, lots of sneering). It was more FUN to vote for Barkley.", "creatorid": "cdcaa9ab1742", "commentid": "c3967ec53d10", "name": "1917_2", "parent": "1917", "sentenceid": "2c47"}
