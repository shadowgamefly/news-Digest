{"name": "1351_1", "child": "", "content": "Though Heller\u2019s experience is an especially jarring example of soliciting in the investment world, it did not happen in a vacuum. Startup founders shop for funding from a m\u00e9lange of investors, who can come and go at different stages of a company\u2019s gestation. Broadly, founders have the option of raising money from family and friends, rich people with money to spare (more formally known as angel investors), or a venture capital firm. There are upsides and downsides to all options. For one, friends and family don\u2019t always have deep pockets. But when it comes to procuring money from strangers, angel investors are often more accessible to new entrepreneurs than VC firms, which typically know more about the area of business they\u2019re funding. The former has tended to be somewhat riskier, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as buzz around the VC industry has drawn increased participation from less experienced financiers, says Josh Lerner, a professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School. Even if some angel investors may be experienced corporate executives, former entrepreneurs, or VCs who are investing on the side, others may be deeply unfamiliar with the investing world at large.", "title": "", "parent": "1351", "creatorid": "bd4b9d2116da", "sentenceid": "b1cc", "commentid": "777d5f84da07"}
