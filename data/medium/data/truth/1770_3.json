{"name": "1770_3", "child": "", "content": "This proposal rests on the assumption that \u201cfake news\u201d will be easy to spot and define. At its base, \u201cfake news,\u201d the concept and practice, is clickbait, and has been, in part, manufactured by the incentives baked into how organizations and individuals gain attention over social media networks (through clicks, shares, and likes). It\u2019s a term that has come to refer to a wide-range of media practices that build upon clickbait logics. In more black-and-white cases, fake news refers to intentionally made-up stories hosted on hastily built websites (i.e. The Denver Guardian or The Baltimore Gazette). These types of fake news websites, built by teenagers in Macedonia or by citizens in the U.S. to make money (or just lulz) off the circulation of outrage, fear, or anxiety. But most fake news is very gray. It consists of misleading headlines, deceptive edits, consensus-based truthmaking in communities like reddit or 8chan (i.e. pizzagate), or by the absorption of fake news by political figures, like Donald Trump, who have the power to make fake news, newsworthy.", "title": "", "parent": "1770", "creatorid": "8bfc99121ab3", "sentenceid": "34e5", "commentid": "6b2394310288"}
