(I did not intend to make that sentence rhyme.) It\u2019s when one person is laying on their side, right behind another person who\u2019s also laying on their side. When penetration happens, usually, the person on the back end can embrace the person in front. In other words, a guy can be inside of a woman, grinding, while fondling her breasts. If this position is done right, it\u2019s a combination of dirty-ass, sweaty screwing, and, passionate lovemaking. Tip: for men\u2026if you\u2019re in this position, and you\u2019re behind a woman, either slowly kiss on her ear or neck, or whisper something dirty in her ear. Be prepared for wet sheets.", "title": "", "parent": "200", "creatorid": "35d889f8acdf", "sentenceid": "dedd", "commentid": "6dbe5deb37db"}
