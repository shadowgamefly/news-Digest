{"name": "418_3", "child": "", "content": "Look, Google was never going to fix the nation\u2019s high-capacity internet access problem. It\u2019s a problem with several dimensions: In most major urban areas, local cable monopolies dominate completely, selling high-priced, second-rate data services that are inextricably bundled with pay TV packages and unthreatened by competition. In rural areas, former telco monopolies are doing their best to transform themselves into wireless media distribution platforms, cutting off millions of Americans from the modern world by relegating them to third- or fourth-rate unreliable data services. (I keep encountering rural stories of telcos cutting off even crappy DSL service any time anyone stops a subscription; realtors are tearing their hair out trying to ensure that some narrow drip of data will be available to a new buyer of a home. That\u2019s a cataclysm.)", "title": "", "parent": "418", "creatorid": "fa75c4fb901f", "sentenceid": "30d8", "commentid": "e5688fbd489e"}
