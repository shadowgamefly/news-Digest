We did not lose to Estes so much as we lost to a president, a vice president, a speaker of the house, and multiple senators coming in and helping out. So in 2018 when there\u2019s 435 races going on, he\u2019s not going to be able to do that for everybody. I think that those congressmen and senators need to be looking at their positions on things, because there\u2019s going to be backlash and there\u2019s going to be people who lose their seats in 2018 as a result of it.", "title": "", "parent": "1487", "creatorid": "d5bfa5d6de42", "sentenceid": "7128", "commentid": "ff28ebed7202"}
