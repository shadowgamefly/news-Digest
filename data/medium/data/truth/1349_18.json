And if you try to make it too rational in a particular way, a very culturally specific way, you\u2019ll simply end up with less giving. And then also, a lot of the particular targets of effective altruism, I\u2019m not sure, are bad ideas. So somewhere like Harvard, it has a huge endowment, it\u2019s super non- or even anti-egalitarian. But it\u2019s nonetheless a self-replicating cluster of creativity. And if you\u2019re a rich person, Harvard was your alma mater, and you give them a million dollars, is that a bad idea? I don\u2019t know, but effective altruists tend to be quite sure it\u2019s a bad idea.", "title": "", "parent": "1349", "creatorid": "776a9957d6e0", "sentenceid": "03c2", "commentid": "e6398df5dbdd"}
