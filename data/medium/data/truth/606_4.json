{"name": "606_4", "child": "", "content": "Being an architect, I had a high-level view of all technical developments on the project. While that sounds cool, it has its disadvantages. The higher you go up the ladder, the less of a concrete impact you have on the game. You\u2019re either a grunt who works on a tiny part of the game (\u201cSee that lamppost? I put it there!\u201d), or you\u2019re a high-level director who writes emails and goes to meetings (\u201cSee that road full of lampposts? I approved that.\u201d). Both positions suck for different reasons. No matter what your job, you don\u2019t make a significant contribution to the game. You\u2019re a drop in a glass of water, and as soon as you realize that, your ownership evaporates in the sun. And without ownership, there\u2019s no motivation.", "title": "", "parent": "606", "creatorid": "27ffaf4b6a27", "sentenceid": "e19c", "commentid": "45b7e2568d19"}
