He has sold millions of records, played the silent villain in the biggest musical release of 2016, and continues to dutifully drop dusty feature verses in 2017. Like many of the artists who choose to trade ubiquity for long-term exclusivity \u2014 ranging from Beyonc\u00e9 to Taylor Swift to Garth Brooks \u2014 he\u2019s bigger than any one platform. But I managed to carve Jay Z out of my life without even really thinking about it, just because his best songs weren\u2019t available at my fingertips. With the gaps in streaming catalogs now seemingly a permanent way of life in music consumption, I\u2019m beginning to wonder how many other music fans have simply cut Jay Z, or other hard-to-access artists, out of their listening habits.", "title": "", "parent": "1756", "creatorid": "5d1c6ca93c65", "sentenceid": "da08", "commentid": "13e71a6e90fa"}
