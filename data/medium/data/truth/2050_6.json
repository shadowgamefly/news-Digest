{"child": "", "title": "", "content": "The first problem that popped up was adding React Native as a dependency without pulling in the entire library. Doing so would not only increase the binary size, but would also have a large impact on methods count, making Instagram for Android go multi-dex with all the performance consequences this entails (yes, Instagram is still single-dex!). We ended up selectively pulling in only the view managers we needed at that time and writing our own implementations for the ones that depended on libraries we didn\u2019t want to pull in. Ultimately, React Native ended up adding ~3500 methods. Features written in React Native barely require defining Java methods, so we believe this investment will be worthwhile in the long run.", "creatorid": "b0affb225289", "commentid": "3e7176c84529", "name": "2050_6", "parent": "2050", "sentenceid": "511e"}
