For example, he has a 3 that he likes to shoot earlier in the game to figure out whether it\u2019s going to be one of those nights where he goes atomic. That one\u2019s called The Thermometer 3, and it\u2019s 10 percent devastating. He has one called The Our Father Who Art In Heaven 3, and that\u2019s the one he shoots where he arcs the ball some 40 feet up in the air, like he did to Tyson Chandler in 2013. That one is 20 percent devastating. He has one called The Shallow-Grave 3 (30 percent devastating), one called The Enemy At The Gates 3 (40 percent devastating), and one called The GTFOH 3 that he seems to save up and use only against the Clippers \u2026", "title": "", "parent": "126", "creatorid": "5282bea29723", "sentenceid": "abf0", "commentid": "5fd1e29d0565"}
