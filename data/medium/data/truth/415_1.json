They fly at altitudes between 200 and 400 feet, well under the 500 feet where general aviation vehicles fly. A sortie can go as far as 20 miles roundtrip, from warehouse to customer and back.

(The package can be up to five pounds or so, which covers around 85 to 90 percent of Amazon deliveries.) When the drone returns to base, the battery is swapped out and the flying courier is ready for another run.", "title": "", "parent": "415", "creatorid": "ada4f5c6d214", "sentenceid": "b4cc", "commentid": "29f2a418be1d"}
