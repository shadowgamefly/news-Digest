{"name": "911_3", "child": "", "content": "An underappreciated factor in the future direction of tech is also going to be people\u2019s inherent preference for what they have already learned. The keyboard layout on your smartphone is still QWERTY, a configuration that was originally devised in 1868 to minimise the clash of strikers on manual typewriters. Rationally better keyboard layouts, like Dvorak, were devised long ago, but haven\u2019t been widely adopted. The iPhone and iPod were successful because they delivered huge improvements to earlier products that delivered poor user experience (phones and music players); by contrast, Dvorak wasn\u2019t successful, because on the whole, the UX of the QWERTY keyboard was unproblematic, and it wasn\u2019t a change that users wanted or needed.", "title": "", "parent": "911", "creatorid": "482265ff5e86", "sentenceid": "3eee", "commentid": "4135910165bb"}
