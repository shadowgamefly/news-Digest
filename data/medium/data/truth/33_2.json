{"name": "33_2", "child": "", "content": "Russell Westbrook has accomplished something that nobody has since 1962, and when a sports thing happens for the first time in a few decades, we\u2019re often reminded about what has changed in the world since the last time. In 1962, stamps didn\u2019t even cost a nickel! People used vinyl records for reasons besides the vintage-chic factor! Barely anybody had Facebook! What a strange time!! It\u2019s also worth noting what\u2019s changed in the sport since then.
