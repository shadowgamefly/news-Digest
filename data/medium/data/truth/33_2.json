{"commentid": "e8ef386be057", "content": "Juliet Litman: Rarely do the Spurs make careless errors. What they lack in talent, they make up in ball movement and militaristic consistency. Danny Green even had to get eye surgery to fall in line. Thus it was jarring to watch San Antonio fall to the surging Blazers on Wednesday, 110\u2013106. In the last minute, the Spurs failed to foul and allowed Terry Stotts to call a timeout. They let C.J. McCollum run four seconds off the clock before sending him to the line; Manu Ginobili botched an inbound pass, and then most ignominious of all, he missed a free throw he intended to make and made one he intended to miss. A comedy of errors, really. Except if staying in the 2-spot means the Spurs evade this feisty Portland team in Round 1, maybe a close loss is worth it.", "child": "", "sentenceid": "7dec", "parent": "33", "creatorid": "69d087ff8e33", "name": "33_2", "title": ""}
