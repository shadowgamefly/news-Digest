Now those job listings are mostly for small biz, mostly retail, those kind of things for now, but there is nothing to prevent Facebook from starting to offer white collar jobs and offer all the functionality that LinkedIn employs. There\u2019s nothing particularly technically amazing about what LinkedIn does. They\u2019ve got some nice ad targeting options and things like that, and there\u2019s a lot of content there and a lot of institutionalized behavior of people using LinkedIn for that kind of purpose, but there\u2019s nothing in LinkedIn\u2019s arsenal that Facebook couldn\u2019t copy. There\u2019s certainly no sort of moat around the functionality. And so if LinkedIn continues to succeed, and I think LinkedIn\u2019s doing a real good job lately with the new redesign and things like that, is Facebook going to let LinkedIn continue to have this kind of toe hold in the business market?", "sentenceid": "c353", "parent": "2186"}
