{"content": "Obviously work by women about sexual assault has received critical acclaim and attention (Morrison, Oates, Walker, to name a few). But men rarely recommend those books to me (excepting my dad, who gave me Morrison novels when I was a teenager), and as far as I can tell, men are far less likely to idolize those authors, aspire to their cultural status, or blatantly copy their stylistic idiosyncrasies. More mundanely, I\u2019ve never heard a woman express shock or horror on hearing that a man has never read Beloved. It wouldn\u2019t occur to most women to recommend books by women to men the way men recommend books by men to women.", "creatorid": "209b14e49124", "title": "", "parent": "2459", "name": "2459_1", "commentid": "3a91930becdc", "child": "", "sentenceid": "d774"}
