{"content": "I came into the office as usual and endured the silent treatment for a short time before Michael asked me to have a talk. When we stepped outside he told me that things weren\u2019t working out, that I had tried to \u201ckill the company by turning the team against him by encouraging them to file wage claims\u201d, and that I took credit for work I didn\u2019t do. I\u2019m sure you can guess who\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d I supposedly took credit for. I calmly told Michael that firing me for the wage claims was considered retaliation and illegal in the state of California and if he wanted to fire me for cause (aka \u201cperformance reasons\u201d) he had the right to do so, but I had evidence to prove otherwise and he still legally owed me my wages, bonus and severance. Earlier in the week I had taken screenshots of our Trello task board (Jessica was changing it around to make it look like I did nothing), I forwarded myself each work communication email, each passive aggressive comment Jessica would mistakenly post through our company\u2019s Facebook Page and delete later (I received notifications as a page admin), every instance Michael promised payments, and of course most importantly the forged wire transfers. If there\u2019s anything you take away from my story I hope it is this: always CYA. I packed my laptop and caught Charlie on the way out. He was more professional and cordial. We actually shook hands, thanked each other for the opportunity, and he promised to let me know when he could pay me and everyone else. I walked away with a mixed feeling of relief and disappointment before mailing off my retaliation complaint to the state.", "title": "", "creatorid": "ffc1f26b16bb", "name": "2441_13", "sentenceid": "cd24", "parent": "2441", "commentid": "f9e4f9b67c11", "child": ""}
