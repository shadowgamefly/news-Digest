No, not because both movies feature a dethroned ruler who is trying to defend his kingdom from an evil sorcerer, or because both feature bombastic feats of slow-motion swordplay, or even because each movie adheres to a sort of punk-medieval aesthetic with splashes of color (well, OK, now I\u2019m thinking of those things). No, I thought of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword because that was the other trailer in only a month\u2019s span to pull out all the stops and feature an iconic song by Led Zeppelin, arguably the greatest band that ever lived. They\u2019re big, they\u2019re bold, and they\u2019re Hollywood\u2019s new secret weapon when it comes to blockbuster titles.", "sentenceid": "ca19", "parent": "2271"}
