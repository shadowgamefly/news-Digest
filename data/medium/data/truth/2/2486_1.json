{"content": "Even if you reject climate science, the problem of powering the world, and doing so in a sustainable, pollution-free way, is one of the most daunting long-term ones facing humanity. Nuclear fusion as a power source has never been given the necessary funding to develop it to fruition, but it\u2019s the one physically possible solution to our energy needs with no obvious downsides. If we can get the idea that \u201cnuclear\u201d means \u201cpotential for disaster\u201d out of our heads, people from all across the political spectrum just might be able to come together and solve our energy and environmental needs in one single blow. If you think the government should be investing in science with national and global payoffs, you can\u2019t do better than the ROI that would come from successful fusion research. The physics works out beautifully; we now just need the investment and the engineering breakthroughs.", "creatorid": "71a8f5351dda", "title": "", "parent": "2486", "name": "2486_1", "commentid": "2be14938c288", "child": "", "sentenceid": "9e76"}
