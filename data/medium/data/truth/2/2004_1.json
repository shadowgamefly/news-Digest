Or that passing mechanics and delivery were absent? In the eyes of Walsh and Parcells, success and productivity override mechanics. And don\u2019t throw Tim Tebow at me. Tebow succeeded in college as a runner, not a thrower. He failed in pro football not due to his mechanics (they certainly didn\u2019t help), but because he had no feel for the passing game, no instincts, and zero willingness to improve. Tebow wanted to run with the ball, not sling it. That can\u2019t work in the pros. We see the same mistakes happen in basketball evaluations. Does it matter that UCLA phenom Lonzo Ball\u2019s shot mechanics look unorthodox when he keeps draining shots? Who cares? What\u2019s the result?", "sentenceid": "81a7", "parent": "2004"}
