{"content": "SegWit lifts the block size limit to 4MB with 1MB base and 3MB witness block. However, from the current transaction data, the average effective block size will be less than 2MB even if all transactions upgrade to SegWit. This is a tremendous waste. If we want to double the capacity of Bitcoin, we\u2019ll need to make sure the internet bandwidth to run full nodes can support at least 8MB blocks, instead of 2MB. This will make it even tougher to increase block size in the future.", "creatorid": "495d97580d58", "title": "", "parent": "2529", "name": "2529_8", "commentid": "ca16a858baa2", "child": "", "sentenceid": "a2a9"}
