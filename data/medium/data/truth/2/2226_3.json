Kendrick has spent the past six years reimagining \u2014 five times over at this point \u2014 what it means to make a great Compton rap album, having gone so far as to make a jazz opus instead with To Pimp a Butterfly. Compared to the rapper\u2019s 2015 masterpiece, Damn. feels much less like an art project. It is far more engaged with contemporary hip-hop without having to capitulate to every SoundCloud trend. Damn. proves that the rapper\u2019s right ear is turned toward the past only because his left ear faces hip-hop\u2019s future.", "sentenceid": "4c4b", "parent": "2226"}
