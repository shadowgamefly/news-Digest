{"content": "But the first man to recommend Wallace to me was Robert Lanham, author of The Hipster Handbook, a caustic guide to early-2000s-Williamsburg-era culture that I picked up as a teenager in Virginia. I felt obliged to pay attention to a section titled \u201cHipster Literature: If You Haven\u2019t Read These Works, At Least Pretend You Have,\u201d where Infinite Jest appears between Haruki Murakami and Ben Marcus (the list is 93.5% male). \u201cActually, scratch this one,\u201d Lanham concludes. \u201cIt\u2019s too damn long. Hipsters just hear that it\u2019s good. If they actually read it they\u2019d see that Wallace is a poseur.\u201d Despite this relatively sick burn, I wanted to know for myself.
