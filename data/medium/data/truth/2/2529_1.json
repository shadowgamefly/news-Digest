{"content": "Second-tier networks such as Lightning Network (which relies on SegWit) cannot be considered as a block scaling solution. LN transactions are NOT equal to Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer on-chain transactions and most Bitcoin use scenarios are not applicable with Lightning Network. LN will also lead to big payment \u201ccenters\u201d, and this is against Bitcoin\u2019s initial design as a peer-to-peer payment system. It can be a good method though for frequent and small Bitcoin transactions in certain cases. But we cannot rely on it as a cure for Bitcoin scaling.", "creatorid": "495d97580d58", "title": "", "parent": "2529", "name": "2529_1", "commentid": "4d20a7215caf", "child": "", "sentenceid": "8b07"}
