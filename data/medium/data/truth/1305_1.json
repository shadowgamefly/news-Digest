{"name": "1305_1", "child": "", "content": "All creatures would like to improve their quality of life. In a world of scarce resources, though, this is only possible through technological progress. Not all creatures have this ability. Humans have it in spades, which is why we have a better quality of life than any animal on the planet. Money is one of our most powerful technological innovations. It allows us to measure profit and to transfer technology easily between each other. If all the birds on a tropical island got together one day and decided to assign some imaginary value to pebbles, pretty soon there would be a seagull buying branches for two pebbles from some forest bird and selling them to other seagull for three. That leftover pebble is the financial measure of profit (the real profit is not having to fly around all day looking for branches; being able to take that extra pebble, buy some fish from the pelican next door, and not have to go hunting), which is simply a signal that what the seagull is doing is sustainable.", "title": "", "parent": "1305", "creatorid": "d2cce06f883e", "sentenceid": "19ae", "commentid": "f564ebd2b235"}
