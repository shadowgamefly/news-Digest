{"name": "1510_2", "child": "", "content": "If you want to comment on a draft regulation, then you need to know it\u2019s out there and you need to know how to comment. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t found a clearinghouse for all proposed regulations that the left might care about. (Someone should get on that!) But at least for right now, the government has a great site (www.regulations.gov) that helps you find proposed regulations, including the ones receiving the most attention. On the front page is a \u201ctrending\u201d list and a search function that allows you to search by topic. You can also browse \u201cfeatured\u201d regulations by topic, although there are no guarantees on how the featuring will continue to be done. The site makes it easy to comment with a click, and track what happens next. You can even search on the front page by topic.", "title": "", "parent": "1510", "creatorid": "1cde425965ac", "sentenceid": "d7f7", "commentid": "2c6aed0f176c"}
