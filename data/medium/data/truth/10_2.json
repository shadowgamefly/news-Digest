(Of course, the deplaned man was not denied boarding, he was already boarded.) The language continues however, shining light on how these \u201cother Passengers\u201d are chosen. It\u2019s not random, it\u2019s \u201cin accordance with UA\u2019s boarding priority.\u201d That means that if you have a higher fare class, have a complex itinerary, have status (e.g. gold or platinum), have checked in early, or are a frequent flier, you are less likely to be asked to take the next flight. Even if it\u2019s just a frequent flier card that you never use, it might save you from being forcibly dragged off a plane.", "title": "", "parent": "10", "creatorid": "17bb3a83a9c2", "sentenceid": "500b", "commentid": "2e00c7a86b9"}
