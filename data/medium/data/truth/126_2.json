{"name": "126_2", "child": "", "content": "Description and Example: This is the 3 where you want it to be one way, but Steph shoots it to let you know it\u2019s the other way. The most perfect example was that 3 at the end of the third quarter of Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Grizzlies in 2015. The series was tied 3\u20132 and they were playing in Memphis. The game was close (68\u201373) and the Grizzlies had the ball with a chance to cut it to two or three. Also, remember, this was before the Warriors had won a championship, so most people didn\u2019t quite understand how all the way terrifying that team was yet. There was a feeling that if Memphis could just squeak out a win in Game 6, their veteran leadership would prove the difference in a big, Big, BIG Game 7. Only Jeff Green dribbled the ball up the court in the final seconds, tried to shoot a 3 at the buzzer, had it blocked, and then everyone watched as Steph, who\u2019d grabbed the loose ball, chest-passed a 75-foot shot at the buzzer toward the other rim that swished in. The Grizzlies were suddenly down eight, the crowd was stunned, and 12 game minutes later the Warriors were headed to the next round of the playoffs. The Grizzlies wanted it to be one way, but it was the other way.", "title": "", "parent": "126", "creatorid": "ad0221013ed", "sentenceid": "d71b", "commentid": "d2456e7392c2"}
