{"name": "994_1", "child": "", "content": "Maybe I could take Lyft to my gym. A one-way Lyft trip from my job would be around $7 plus tip. Since I usually give a $5 tip, a Lyft trip would cost me $12. But then, I would still have to take two buses and a train to get home. Taking Lyft both ways would reduce the money in my wallet by at least $26. Going to the gym three times a week would cost $78, more than the utility payment at my new apartment.", "title": "", "parent": "994", "creatorid": "38d5adc20433", "sentenceid": "aa16", "commentid": "186ca75ee64a"}
