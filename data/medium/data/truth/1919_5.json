{"child": "", "title": "", "content": "The biggest underachievers this season were the Timberwolves, who currently sit 10.5 games below their projected total of 41.5 wins. The Wolves won 29 games last season, but entered this season with the assumption that their young talent would take large developmental strides. That assumption wasn\u2019t wrong. Andrew Wiggins has improved in nearly every relevant category, scoring nearly 24 points a game and ramping up his 3-point shooting from 30 percent last year to a respectable 36 percent this season. Karl-Anthony Towns, who is averaging over 25 points a game, has had a monster sophomore season. Zach LaVine even improved his true shooting percentage for the second consecutive season, showing that he has the potential to grow into a release valve for Towns and Wiggins. But of course, LaVine\u2019s ACL tear derailed Minnesota\u2019s supposed leap season. The back half of the year could have been useful for getting Wiggins, Towns, and LaVine more experience together. Presumably, the team would have improved, at least marginally, as they learned how to play together in Tom Thibodeau\u2019s system. Instead, the Wolves didn\u2019t improve at all as the season went on. They are just 12\u201318 since LaVine\u2019s injury, and have lost 11 of their past 15 games.", "creatorid": "3c7bea2a5be7", "commentid": "f68609d43edd", "name": "1919_5", "parent": "1919", "sentenceid": "d6eb"}
