In fact, earlier last year I had begun experimenting with an early example of The New Wifi gadgets \u2014 they come in packs, like wolves or mean girls \u2014 called Eero. It\u2019s named after a designer, which is the official international signal that you\u2019re going to overpay for something. (Eero Saarinen was the dude who designed those chairs that are the furniture equivalent of Modigliani models; he was also behind the recently bulldozed TWA Terminal at JFK. By the way, if a product is named after a designer with two double vowels in his name, it\u2019s going to cost even more.)", "title": "", "parent": "419", "creatorid": "12f14d933ffd", "sentenceid": "f209", "commentid": "a728327c0617"}
