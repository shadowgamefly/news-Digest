{"name": "1773_2", "child": "", "content": "For one, the epithet of \u201cpropaganda\u201d raises the spectre of state control, but governments are only one of the types of collectives that can exert influence over media. The most egregious historical cases of propaganda \u2014 ones everyone agrees were propagandistic \u2014 were media productions that issued from, or were driven by, state (or would-be state) actors. Scholarly treatments, of propaganda, too, tend to focus on state (or would-be state) actors). When coordinated, persuasive messages issue from non-state entities, we tend to use gentler terms like public relations, which shifts matters from the civic sphere to the seemingly separate sphere of commerce, or activism, which conjures images of grassroots, bottom-up persuasion. But these bright-line divisions are not as reliable as they seem.", "title": "", "parent": "1773", "creatorid": "e331706e69b0", "sentenceid": "8ed2", "commentid": "935803acf9fc"}
