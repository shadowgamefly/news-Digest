{"name": "981_1", "child": "", "content": "The thing I love about her the most is that she didn\u2019t feel the need to take another venture into writing after she wrote what would become one of the best books written in American literature. After writing her work of art she decided her work was done. Her heart was clear. Her life was shared. There was no more to be said. Period! I am sure people pressured her time after time to out do her first book by giving fans more of her penmanship. She stood completely content and her pen remained silent for the remainder of her life. It wasn\u2019t about the money or fame for her. She didn\u2019t want to force work out of herself unless she felt a calling to do so. To do such a thing is honorable, selfless, and rare to say the least. People just don\u2019t do things of that nature regularly but I appreciate her for stepping out of the norm to follow her heart. I am fully aware that she released a book last year in July but for most of her life to Kill A Mockingbird was the only book she wrote and the sequel is debatable on if she really is the author. So to my knowledge To Kill A Mockingbird is her only real book.", "title": "", "parent": "981", "creatorid": "4ae7e653b520", "sentenceid": "decf", "commentid": "ff09ccc20f37"}
