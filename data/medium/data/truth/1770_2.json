{"name": "1770_2", "child": "", "content": "Facebook will rely on users to report fake news despite evidence that suggests users have a difficult time assessing or identifying fake news. Teens seem to be especially vulnerable to fake news. A recent study by researchers at Stanford found that middle and high school students have a difficult time detecting fake news from real news, or detecting bias in tweets and Facebook statuses. In Pew\u2019s recent study on fake news, they found that individuals are often confident in their ability to identify fake news (around 2/3 of those surveyed), but we don\u2019t know if that confidence translates to being able to identify fake news. The same study found that a fourth of respondents admitted to sharing fake news on at least one occasion. If Facebook\u2019s solution is to rely, in part, on users to report fake news through a system of flagging, users need to be trained in this type of identification.", "title": "", "parent": "1770", "creatorid": "3b3f603a18df", "sentenceid": "25cc", "commentid": "67b210f463f2"}
