{"name": "43_3", "child": "", "content": "It feels weird to say that the Warriors are anybody other than Steph Curry\u2019s team, given that he was their best player when they won a championship in 2015 and also their best player when they won a record 73 regular-season games in 2016. But I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s starting to feel that way, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sure Golden State fans will argue otherwise \u2014 that it\u2019s Steph\u2019s team and that it will be Steph\u2019s team as long as he\u2019s there \u2014 and I get that. I understand that impulse. I appreciate the urge to stand up for him, because he absolutely deserves it. But again: I don\u2019t know. Kevin has a higher scoring average than Steph, a higher rebounding average, higher win shares, a higher VORP, a higher BPM, and a higher PER. I\u2019m not all the way ready to say that Durant snatched that particular title away from Steph, but I\u2019m also not willing to ignore the conversation anymore, either.", "title": "", "parent": "43", "creatorid": "17700c413015", "sentenceid": "d329", "commentid": "11330dcecf72"}
