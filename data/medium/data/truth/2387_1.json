{"name": "2387_1", "content": "One comment: in talking recently with one portfolio company who\u2019s implemented OKRs, I realized that I should have been more emphatic in pointing out that OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations. OKRs are about the company\u2019s goals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance evaluations \u2014 which are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period \u2014 should be independent from their OKRs. We\u2019ll cover employee evaluations in an upcoming workshop.", "parent": "2387", "title": "", "creatorid": "cba20cbf1c32", "child": "", "sentenceid": "da0e", "commentid": "db9e6befd4a"}
