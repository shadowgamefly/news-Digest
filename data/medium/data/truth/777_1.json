{"name": "777_1", "child": "", "content": "So I started going to meetups. I remember going to one in particular. I walked around, super nervous to talk to anyone. So I did a lap, walking around the perimeter, waiting to see if anyone would strike up a conversation. 3 laps later, I went to the bar and was about to walk out the door when the little Gary Vee on my shoulder said to go talk to someone. I turned to my left and said hi to the first person, she struck up a conversation and then ended up dragging me over to Vin Vacanti (Vin was working on aggregating daily deals, and I was helping my college friend Matt Humphrey with his daily deal site Homerun in NY). It was a perfect match, and Vin\u2019s welcoming spirit helped me to see how open people in the NY tech community were to meeting folks and helping them on their journeys. We met for lunch soon after and he gave advice and counsel that I still cherish.", "title": "", "parent": "777", "creatorid": "36570b83b5f5", "sentenceid": "e6f8", "commentid": "eb9626aab859"}
