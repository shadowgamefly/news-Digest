When a woman is up for this, and can do it, well\u2026she may get an engagement ring. Tomorrow night. This position is erotic, fun, hot, wild, exciting\u2026it\u2019s amazing. Now, the guy has to be able to perform, too. A man can stay still, and let the lady do all of the work, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Dudes should tilt their pelvises slightly in the up position, even if they are well endowed. Just enough to hit those special spots inside of a woman.
