{"name": "126_5", "child": "", "content": "Just inside the final two minutes of a still-kind-of-close game between the Warriors (107) and the Rockets (99) earlier this week, Steph Curry had the ball 5 feet behind the 3-point line and was staring down Clint Capela, a lovable and respectable center for the Rockets. Now, had the Rockets been able to force a stop there, they\u2019d have been in a decent spot. They have the league\u2019s second-most-potent offense, and they have James Harden, who is as deadly an offensive weapon as there has ever been, so the game would have certainly been in reach and even, potentially, winnable. (Harden actually ended up making a 3 on the very next play, which would\u2019ve cut the lead to five with still over a minute and a half to play.) Steph, though, the bossiest of all the babies, made sure none of that came into play.", "title": "", "parent": "126", "creatorid": "41eb119e0f5d", "sentenceid": "a6e1", "commentid": "1f14223d3b64"}
