{"name": "362_3", "child": "", "content": "The problem I see with worldbuilding is that readers have come to expect books to meet a standard that the author can\u2019t possibly (and probably isn\u2019t trying to) meet. When I\u2019ve taught fiction classes, I\u2019ve often seen that when students encounter a book outside of the modes of actual realism or faux worldbuilding realism, they don\u2019t know how to evaluate it. They believe that a different way of seeing reality aren\u2019t invitations to see reality in a new way yourself, but simply failures of worldbuilding.", "title": "", "parent": "362", "creatorid": "2621740a8063", "sentenceid": "aba5", "commentid": "50a9a0f0c4e2"}
