Do they really think that what Spanish speakers need is bad translations of their English content? Do they think that Spanish speakers are so desperate for content, or so bad at their own language, or so bad at articulating ideas, that their bad translations can compete with newspapers that hire humans who speak Spanish? Do they think that these bad algorithmic translations are the best way to create a bridge with the largest alienated community of the United States?", "title": "", "parent": "390", "creatorid": "d34068f9dfe8", "sentenceid": "35ba", "commentid": "1c0b3baddea9"}
