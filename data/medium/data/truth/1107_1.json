Conservative culture warriors have insisted for a couple of decades now that a core component of Christianity \u2014 if not THE core component \u2014 is opposition to homosexual relationships and virtually all queer identities. The implicit argument throughout this book is that Christian debate over economics and divorce \u2014 things Jesus gives explicit instructions about \u2014 are permissible, but any discussion of LGBT identities \u2014 things Jesus either didn\u2019t talk about or implicitly endorsed, depending on who you ask \u2014 is a red line for orthodox Christians.", "title": "", "parent": "1107", "creatorid": "ccbb13edbcd3", "sentenceid": "7bce", "commentid": "800616949afd"}
