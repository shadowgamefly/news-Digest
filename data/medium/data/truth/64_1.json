{"content": "Conceptually, numbers are just quantities, but how we represent those quantities can vary. We typically represent numbers in a base-10 number system. What that means is every digit\u2019s place in a number represents a power of 10. That is, the number 123 represents 1\u00d710\u00b3 + 2\u00d710\u00b9 + 3\u00d710\u2070. However, it is possible to use a number system that is not based on powers of 10. It\u2019s hard to imagine living in a world that uses a non-base-10 number system, but in reality, the way representation numbers is completely arbitrary! So why are we using a 10-based number system? You guessed it \u2014 we have 10 fingers!", "sentenceid": "11f7", "creatorid": "1817f12522ae", "title": "", "parent": "64", "child": "", "name": "64_1", "commentid": "a9a4f0399b62"}
