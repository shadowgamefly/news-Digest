Aaliyah remains an internet talking point, but a lot of the discussion centers on her style rather than her actual music. She\u2019s become a symbol partially due to her sudden death but also because her music lockdown forces us to engage with her through images and memory alone.", "title": "", "parent": "1756", "creatorid": "30ee66f178af", "sentenceid": "027f", "commentid": "f048b0499ec9"}
