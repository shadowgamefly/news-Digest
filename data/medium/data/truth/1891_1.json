Unconscious bias is the result of the brain working automatically to make decisions without thinking, programmed to make quick decisions a legacy of our survival instincts. This results from the brain deflecting to moments that are familiar to us and to what we know. These biases represent themselves in the systems and designs being created. Unconscious bias exists in many forms, including race, gender, culture, age and religion.
