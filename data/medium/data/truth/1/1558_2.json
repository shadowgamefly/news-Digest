I may be quiet but when I don\u2019t say anything, it means that I really don\u2019t have anything to say. I don\u2019t hide what must be said unless it isn\u2019t useful. I meet too many people who hide their true feelings while I think things are just fine. I meet too many people who expect me to read their minds when I don\u2019t know them well enough to know what they are thinking and feeling (even when I know a person rather well, I still need the person to tactfully tell me what may be wrong or what may need to be improved or what needs to be done). I tend to be polite about anything I would like to express. I speak in a matter-in-fact tone. There was a joke told to me that Turkish people didn\u2019t communicate, that it just wasn\u2019t something they did. I just think we need to do the best of our ability to straighten anything out whatever it takes and this includes having to say something even when this might defy tradition, cultural practice. Sometimes communicating when it\u2019s not the norm is necessary in order to smooth out relations. We need to use all of our means necessary to make sure everyone understands each other.", "creatorid": "330f53a0898f", "parent": "1558", "commentid": "efea98c65450", "child": "", "title": ""}
