He isn\u2019t the greatest athlete, his defense needs serious work, and he doesn\u2019t fit the mold for any position in the league. But here\u2019s the cool part about being a college basketball fan: I don\u2019t have to give a shit about what Swanigan may or may not do in the NBA. I get to enjoy him for what he is now, which is the best player in the Big Ten, the best big man in college basketball, and \u2014 this is going to sound sacrilegious to Robbie Hummel disciples, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway because it\u2019s true \u2014 the best player to wear a Purdue uniform in more than 20 years.", "creatorid": "7c96f3e2f006", "parent": "1672", "commentid": "85c8b6b1b00c", "child": "", "title": ""}
