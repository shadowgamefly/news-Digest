It excites me to no end to think about the fact that most small business (and even A-list personalities) waste $250,000\u2013500,000 a year on tactics like websites, PR, direct mail, or paid media when they could have just gone all in on organic social content and a small amplification budget to achieve more valuable results.", "creatorid": "606c455c4f15", "parent": "1442", "commentid": "5604b7877a04", "child": "", "title": ""}
