{"sentenceid": "5c83", "name": "1272_1", "content": "Thinking inside the box doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay inside it. Cats don\u2019t allow themselves to be limited by the laws of physics when it comes to fitting in boxes. They assume their liquid form and gracefully allow their pillowy sides spill out over the edges. The key to their success is flexibility and prioritization. When given an ambiguous or complex problem such as a seemingly too-small box, a cat will prioritize which parts should go inside the box so that the cat and box can reach a steady state of equilibrium. Cat and box become one. The obvious lesson here is that once you understand the constraints of a problem, you know which ones to push on to achieve your goals.", "creatorid": "dce910afb6a8", "parent": "1272", "commentid": "f46f8ba38768", "child": "", "title": ""}
