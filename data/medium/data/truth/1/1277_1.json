{"sentenceid": "556a", "name": "1277_1", "content": "The second part of the descriptive model is the design thinking process. The process serves as a guide for the design team and provides a structure for the expedient implementation of the principles, mindsets and work attitudes as well as the methods. The process represents a framework in which promising ideas can be generated and user-oriented solutions can flourish. It\u00b4s similar to the Creative Problem Solving Process (CPS Process, a structured creativity process for systematically generating ideas), with certain specific characteristics such as a strong user focus and working with prototypes. There are different variations of the design thinking process; I am guided by the process that is taught at the HPI School of Desgin Thinking in Potsdam. The process can thus be divided into six phases: understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype and test (figure 2).", "creatorid": "f98a13b7c57e", "parent": "1277", "commentid": "da19717b367d", "child": "", "title": ""}
