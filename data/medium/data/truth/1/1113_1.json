You know, one that opens it up to the free market. Construct a plan that actually lets insurers sell across state lines, gets rid of the Medicaid expansion, and does away with tax credits and subsidies. Put in all the solutions that you believe our country needs in order to have the best and cheapest healthcare, where all people have access to coverage.
