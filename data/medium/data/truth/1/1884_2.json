What\u2019s the evolutionary benefit of killing your host when that kills you too? Why does cancer win to die? I was surprised to find so few results on Google. I asked my sister who has studied cancer for 20 years and she said it would be a good post for my blog. Cancer isn\u2019t a virus or bateria. It\u2019s a mutation. A mutation that happens with great regularity amongst some but not all mammals and it mutates in one of a recurring common or rare manners. What is cancer\u2019s purpose. Is it to cull the herd? Is cancer non-evolutionary (i.e. not created by natural forces)? Is cancer still evolving? Is it\u2019s end goal to become transferable from person to person? Tasmanian Devil populations have become decimated by a transferrable facial tumor disease. Are human cancers mutating in half of all humans for the chance to find the variant that leads to transferability? Will cancer jump the transferability firewall?
