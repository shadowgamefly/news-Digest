The Ducks picked up right where they left off against Arizona, bursting out to a 37\u201318 lead. UCLA\u2019s historically great offense was visibly frustrated, Lonzo Ball was a borderline liability, and the Ducks got any shot they wanted. All signs pointed to another massacre until Ball was subbed out late in the first half and UCLA went on a 14\u20130 run to cut the lead to five. But even then, Oregon stopped the bleeding, built a 15-point second-half lead, and seemed to be in control. Only \u2026 well \u2026 I\u2019ll let Dennis Green explain what happened next.", "sentenceid": "8c31", "parent": "1998"}
