Is what the poem has to say being said gracefully enough, i.e. with strength and with music?\n3. If there is a \u201cdeeper\u201d meaning, will the reader be able to discern it?\n4. Is there more that wants to be said? \n5. Is it \u201ctrue\u201d \u2014 not necessarily in terms of fact (i.e. \u201cwhat really happened\u201d), but in terms of its emotions, convictions, ethics?\n6. Is there anything in it \u2014 stanzas, images, words \u2014 that doesn\u2019t belong, or clutter it up?\n7. If it digresses, do the digressions have a purpose?\n8. Does it contain expressions or images that are clich\u00e9d or sentimental?\n9. Is it making a point that\u2019s too predictable, or already evident?\n10. Allowing for some intentional variation, is the grammar correct?\n11. Are you certain that the thoughts, lines, stanzas are presented in the right order?\n12. Has enough attention been paid to line breaks? Why was the line broken where it was? Does it support the rhythm, meaning, or phrasing?\n13. Are the tone / attitude / stance appropriate and consistent? Have you selected the most effective speaker?\n14. Is the level of diction appropriate? If unusual, does it serve a purpose?\n15. If the syntax (word order) is unusual, do the variations serve a purpose?\n16. Are all of the poem\u2019s moments directed toward a common goal?\n17. Does the poem avoid excluding the reader from its meaning or intent?\n18. Does it have an effective ending \u2014 one that the reader will regard as \u201cinevitable\u201d?\n19. Does the poem look inviting on the page?\n20. Overall, do you like the poem?
