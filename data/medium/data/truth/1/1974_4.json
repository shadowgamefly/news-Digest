The most important company 20 years from now has not even been formed yet. So I focus on the process, not the product. How can I keep learning? Should I keep to my simple rule of investing in companies that are unlike anything I have seen before? (That is an example of focusing on process, not sector.) And I plan to continue giving any gain I make to charitable causes, which themselves can have ever growing impact. I have never sold a share of any DFJ investment, but I do donate the public shares over time. It is incredibly rewarding.", "sentenceid": "0d81", "parent": "1974"}
