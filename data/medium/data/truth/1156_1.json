Chapped lips sweep\nDesiccated skin like sand from\nEyelids closed to your sun.\nFields of fertile clay give way to\nGranite wastelands, the barren\nHeart, rock solid and cooling to\nIgneous memory. We lay down\nJuxtaposed veneers of truth and\nKnowing as human essence\nLeaches into the sky, leaving a\nMineral mosaic in its wake.\nNuanced shadows flicker in palms\nOutstretched, seeking oasis \u2014 I\u2019m\nParched, and no nectar can\nQuench my desire. Your call\nReverberates along the ridged\nSpine and settles into desolate\nTessellations. Emptiness wanes\nUnder cavernous embraces and\nVast declarations of intent\nWritten on quivering flesh: \nXOXOXO. You sign with a flourish\nYour name across my breast, falling\nZenith to nadir.", "title": "", "parent": "1156", "creatorid": "3c9c7efe01b9", "sentenceid": "0f17", "commentid": "6c80aefe123e"}
