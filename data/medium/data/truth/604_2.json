{"name": "604_2", "child": "", "content": "Here\u2019s a data point for you: As part of our push to woo Facebook, I had been getting Google Alerts on the company for months. One in particular had caught my attention. In October 2010, a mother in Florida had shaken her baby to death, as the baby would interrupt her FarmVille games with crying. A mother destroyed with her own hands what she\u2019d been programmed over aeons to love, just to keep on responding to Facebook notifications triggered by some idiot game. Products that cause mothers to murder their infants in order to use them more, assuming they\u2019re legal, simply cannot fail in the world. Facebook was legalized crack, and at Internet scale. Such a company could certainly figure out a way to sell shoes. Twitter was cute and all, but it didn\u2019t have a casualty rate yet, no matter how much this Lady Gaga person was tweeting.", "title": "", "parent": "604", "creatorid": "88d00caf4592", "sentenceid": "f058", "commentid": "fe561160e9e4"}
