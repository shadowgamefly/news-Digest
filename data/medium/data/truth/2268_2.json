Literally bursting and popping with life. You can watch it as it rises, hear it if you bend near. You are, with your life-worn hands, shaping life into artful sustenance, as the earliest hands once did. Massaging tiny beasties into a sustaining thing. This sounds like what needs to happen in my middle, a cycle of creation and consumption to fuel something sane and reliable. Maybe this is why they call the middle \u2018the breadbasket\u2019 (though I suspect that\u2019s a little lower, in the stomach, where the bread goes).", "name": "2268_2"}
