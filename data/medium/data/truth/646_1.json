{"name": "646_1", "child": "", "content": "Snapchat can be used for more than just posting nonsense and naughty photos. For companies that know how to use it properly, Snapchat can payoff big-time, as it has an incredible rate of engagement. The only problem is that it\u2019s difficult to build an audience, so you have to be creative. In my case, I printed my personal Snapcode on the back of my business cards, so that people I meet can add me by taking a picture of my card. We also experimented by defining financial terms through Snapchat stories on Hardbacon\u2019s Snapchat account. We then reposted these videos on our YouTube account. After launching our crowdfunding campaign, we went further and sent direct messages to everyone who added Hardbacon on Snapchat with a picture asking them to support our campaign.", "title": "", "parent": "646", "creatorid": "26635b68eeca", "sentenceid": "4056", "commentid": "4369eca0d877"}
