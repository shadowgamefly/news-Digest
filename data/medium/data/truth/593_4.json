{"name": "593_4", "child": "", "content": "I have written extensively about Apple\u2019s problems with services originating from their hardline privacy stance. However, there is another major issue: Apple views services as a value-adding feature, rather than a discrete platform. This stems from their hardware-centric business model, which is accordingly reflected in their device-centred services approach. The problem is that services are eating software, and now often indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, Apple should be treating their services with equal importance as iOS, macOS and tvOS: iCloud should be best-in-class; Siri should be more than just souped-up Voice Control; Apple Music shouldn\u2019t delete people\u2019s music libraries; these services should work seamlessly across all their devices and platforms \u2014 even on the web.", "title": "", "parent": "593", "creatorid": "c3e2c34ff3ac", "sentenceid": "3cff", "commentid": "56ec9f483caf"}
