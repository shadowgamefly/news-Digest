But our physical weakness and vulnerability is not proof that men abuse it. It simply is a fact that by our stature and size we are smaller, have less muscle mass, are slower and do not react physically to violence the way men do. Additionally, the fact that men have more violent tendencies than women does not mean that their violence is expressed on women. Men\u2019s violent tendencies are expressed, primarily, on other men.
