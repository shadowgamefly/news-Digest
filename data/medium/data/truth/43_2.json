{"name": "43_2", "child": "", "content": "In Season 5 of Sons of Anarchy, a television show about a biker gang in a tiny American town, a former U.S. marshal named Lee tries to get one of the gang\u2019s imprisoned members, Otto, to snitch on himself, or his gang, or anybody, really. It\u2019s this whole back-and-forth thing that happens several times throughout the season, Lee getting more and more aggressive in his means of attempting to force Otto to talk. Finally, come the 13th episode, Otto has had enough. He\u2019s in an interrogation room, and there\u2019s a two-way mirror in there and he knows Lee is on the other side, watching. A different law enforcement officer walks in, turns on a voice recorder, sits down, turns on a camcorder, and asks Otto to state his name for the record. Otto sighs, swallows, leans forward, pauses for a second, then sticks his tongue all the way out and slams his chin down onto the table, effectively biting off his own tongue. The officer freaks and runs out of the room. Otto picks up the tongue, then throws it at the mirror.", "title": "", "parent": "43", "creatorid": "6fd4b7e6b98a", "sentenceid": "bb3d", "commentid": "8a00e2722886"}
