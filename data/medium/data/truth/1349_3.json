I agree with [Georg] Hegel\u2019s remarks on polytheism that may not be conducive to political order. I\u2019d say that\u2019s still an uncertain question, but it\u2019s a worry I have. And as [David] Hume pointed out, monotheism itself breaks down into partial polytheism because people want multiple things to worship, to pray to, to talk to. So it\u2019s not a stable balance.", "title": "", "parent": "1349", "creatorid": "776a9957d6e0", "sentenceid": "8280", "commentid": "8bb57e4625c9"}
