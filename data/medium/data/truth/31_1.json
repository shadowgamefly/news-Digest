We\u2019ve set the stage for a compelling four-man finish, but if this still feels like a two-man race to you, it\u2019s because Westbrook and Harden most clearly represent the two most basic schools of thought when it comes to determining the meaning of \u201cmost valuable.\u201d Is it fair to penalize a player for being on a team complementary to his talents? Is it fair to champion a player whose extraordinary effort still only amounts to being the best option on a middling team? Every year, MVP voters grapple with the significance of individual and collective success and how one informs the other \u2014 and every year, the rationale changes. That there is no hardline answer is both beautiful and frustrating. Because all we want is for sports to align with how we see the world. (My theoretical vote would go to Harden. Disagree? Let\u2019s be friends.)", "child": "", "sentenceid": "2b9b", "parent": "31", "creatorid": "7e7776be9712", "name": "31_1", "title": ""}
