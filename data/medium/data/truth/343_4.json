They are huge fans of Shark Tank. Often my sons are in the car when I\u2019m talking with entrepreneurs or my partners about deals. After years of watching Shark Tank it\u2019s heartening to hear them make comments like, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he gave up so much equity? Why didn\u2019t he just do a licensing deal?\u201d Ha.
