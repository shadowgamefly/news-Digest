{"name": "1067_4", "child": "", "content": "The other problem is that the features they request are often band-aids on symptoms, not real solutions. As an example, one of the most requested features while I was at Pinterest was the ability to re-arrange pins. You can imagine the use case: having to always scroll down to the bottom of a board to find your favorite recipe. If only you could drag that pin to be on the top of your board. But this isn\u2019t the best solution. Re-arranging pins is a pain, so it\u2019s the type of feature only a very small percentage of users would use. When you dig deeper, the request is a symptom of a root cause \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find pins you\u2019re looking for. Your job is not to build the features yours are asking for, it\u2019s to ask the right questions that help you find the scalable solution \u2014 the solution that the majority of users will do. In this case, we built what we called \u201cpersonal search\u201d. Now, rather than scroll through a board, a pinner can search across all their pins to find the pin they\u2019re looking for. A lot more people will do a search than constantly re-arrange their pins.", "title": "", "parent": "1067", "creatorid": "b5dc0c4768f6", "sentenceid": "7345", "commentid": "f3337962ac8b"}
