{"name": "19_2", "child": "", "content": "Andrew: The fourth movie in the franchise, Fast & Furious \u2014 not to be confused with the first movie, The Fast and the Furious \u2014 is the 2014\u201315 Cleveland Cavaliers of Fast movies. Stick with me here. That team brought LeBron back into the fold, added Kevin Love to the mix, and came up just short of beating the Golden State Warriors for the championship. The team was, in black-and-white terms, a failure, but it did act as the foundation for the sublimity that followed. The next year, the Cavs added a spark plug \u2014 J.R. Smith \u2014 to their roster and reached a new level of excellence, coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit and beating the Warriors in the NBA Finals. Which is to say, Fast & Furious is a failure (and also, the Rock is the J.R. Smith of the Fast franchise) that doesn\u2019t quite satisfy any of the standards we\u2019ve set. Its best actual race feels too much like a carbon copy of races from the first two movies; its villain is midlevel; and it\u2019s so light on NOS! But! It set the stage for Fast Five, a near-perfect movie, by reintegrating the original cast and injecting the series with a level self-awareness, a tool that\u2019d be honed into an art form by Fasts 5 through 7. You don\u2019t necessarily need to rewatch Fast & Furious, but you should appreciate it for starting the revolution.", "title": "", "parent": "19", "creatorid": "cd442249addc", "sentenceid": "1514", "commentid": "e0c186688ec2"}
