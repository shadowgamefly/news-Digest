Nolte\u2019s position has rendered him irredeemably untrustworthy, and to me as a reader, untrustworthy equals useless. Nolte is not a journalist, he is a political commentator, but trust is important in this role as well, because he is asking me to consider and be persuaded by his opinion, and in this piece he is letting me know that he will knowingly, deliberately leave relevant facts out of his analysis in order to manipulate me into believing whatever the current party line is. This renders all future opinions from him null and void in my book.", "title": "", "parent": "1376", "creatorid": "7da8c6ad9ea0", "sentenceid": "604f", "commentid": "571fd6ea8bd0"}
