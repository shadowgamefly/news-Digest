{"name": "433_9", "child": "", "content": "Here it is in a nutshell. Fowler worked on the Site Reliability Engineering team (SRE), with about 120 men and 6 women. Uber decided to buy the SREs leather jackets, and gave fittings to all. But after the company learned that it had enough men\u2019s sizes to qualify for a discount but would have to pay retail for the women\u2019s jackets, it decided to give jackets only to male SREs. Fowler sent an email to the director to note the unfairness, and he replied essentially that she was being unfair, because if Uber paid more for women\u2019s jackets, then the women would be getting special treatment.", "title": "", "parent": "433", "creatorid": "9e91504b46d9", "sentenceid": "e492", "commentid": "40e89874f87e"}
