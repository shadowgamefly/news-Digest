{"name": "1875_1", "child": "", "content": "I recently got into a really great conversation about hackathons in the Designer Hangout slack channel. We were wondering, what role does a designer actually take on at a hackathon? What value do designers provide hackathons, and what about the opposite? After the conversation, I kept thinking about it, all the hackathons I\u2019ve attended, what I\u2019ve learned, and how I\u2019ve contributed. There seems to be this idea floating around that designers, especially those who don\u2019t code, don\u2019t really have a place or can contribute much during a hackathon. While that notion is (luckily) dying down a bit, I thought I\u2019d write out my thoughts on the subject.", "title": "", "parent": "1875", "creatorid": "a2bf9a2d6ce5", "sentenceid": "4f9d", "commentid": "8e1fd630b9d9"}
