{"name": "443_2", "child": "", "content": "You know, in many ways, Feynman was a loner. Other than for social reasons, he really didn\u2019t like to work with other people. And he was mostly interested in his own work. He didn\u2019t read or listen too much; he wanted the pleasure of doing things himself. He did used to come to physics seminars, though. Although he had rather a habit of using them as problem-solving exercises. And he wasn\u2019t always incredibly sensitive to the speakers. In fact, there was a period of time when I organized the theoretical physics seminars at Caltech. And he often egged me on to compete to find fatal flaws in what the speakers were saying. Which led to some very unfortunate incidents. But also led to some interesting science.", "title": "", "parent": "443", "creatorid": "b5dc0c4768f6", "sentenceid": "4cf8", "commentid": "e5afce9a5361"}
