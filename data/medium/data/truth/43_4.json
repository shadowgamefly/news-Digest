When the Thunder are on offense, it looks like this: they\u2019re swinging the ball around the 3-point line a bit, things are flowing, and then it ends up in Roberson\u2019s hands and it\u2019s like one of those time-travel movies they show on the Disney Channel where some kids travel back to see dinosaurs or whatever and someone hands a caveman a PlayStation Vita and the caveman is like, \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d and he just stares at it and flips it over and shakes it and whatnot. That\u2019s Roberson when he gets the ball. It\u2019s wild to watch. Draymond, who was \u201c\u201cguarding\u201d\u201d Roberson during the game, sagged off of him 10, 15, 20 feet every time. There was one play where Roberson caught the ball on the left wing and Draymond legit just walked to the bench and sat down while Roberson prayed for all of the electricity in America to shut off so he could just set the ball on the floor and walk away without anyone seeing him. I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s a little embarrassing. I hope Roberson starts shooting soon.", "title": "", "parent": "43", "creatorid": "f23ac8706d77", "sentenceid": "9edc", "commentid": "586bdba86bf4"}
