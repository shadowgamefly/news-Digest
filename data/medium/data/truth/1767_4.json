Originally a community for geeks to upvote geeky things, Reddit\u2019s current reputation has been tarnished by communities devoted to the alt-right, men\u2019s rights advocacy, and illicit photos of underage girls wearing yoga pants. In 2014, Reddit was heavily criticized for hosting the Fappening, a subreddit devoted to organizing and discussing stolen nude photos of female celebrities. Then-CEO Yishan Wong wrote a blog post called \u201cEvery Man is Responsible for His Own Soul\u201d where he defended Reddit\u2019s choice to continue hosting the subreddit. Wong claimed that Reddit would not use technical means, like banning users or deleting subreddits, to shut down unpleasant content. Instead, they planned to highlight good actors on the site, like Reddit\u2019s popular Secret Santa. (Confusingly, later that day Reddit deleted the subreddit anyway. Pressure and DMCA requests from deep-pocketed celebrity lawyers were apparently enough to outweigh such lofty ideals.)
