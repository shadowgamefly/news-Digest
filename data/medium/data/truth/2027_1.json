{"child": "", "title": "", "content": "And then there\u2019s Pitbull. Unlike previous Fast soundtrack MVPs, Pitbull has somehow never appeared in a Fast movie, but he\u2019s been blessing these soundtracks with bilingual bops since 2 Fast 2 Furious. That was 2003, when he still wore massively oversized white tees and made crunk music. These days, Pitbull dresses like a Cuban American 007 and makes Carnival Cruise music. The best song on the Fate soundtrack is Pitbull and the Colombian singer J Balvin\u2019s collaboration \u201cHey Ma,\u201d which strikes at American pop music\u2019s current obsession with tropical grooves. \u201cHey Ma\u201d is the slight-but-sensational-work of a rapper whose appeal is as broad and enduring as the Fast franchise itself. Both have come a long and lucrative way since their humble early-2000s beginnings.", "creatorid": "cc3db8989", "commentid": "8ced64b58fad", "name": "2027_1", "parent": "2027", "sentenceid": "d507"}
