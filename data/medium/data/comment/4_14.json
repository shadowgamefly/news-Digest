{"name": "4_14", "child": "", "content": "I think I have offered a reasonable and strong argumentation for the criterion I chose. I have even included visualizations to clarify my reasoning. If it\u2019s not clear, I have argued that the distribution of movie ratings for a particular website should resemble a normal distribution. My argumentation for this thesis contains two assumptions, one of which you seem to find problematic: (1) Most people think that most movies are of an average quality. (2) Movie ratings should reflect movie quality. Your problem is with (1). As I have tried to explain in the previous response, you cannot prove (1) as true or false, because you cannot have access to other people\u2019s minds. You have to assume it as true (or false) and proceed with building a reasoning upon this assumption. I completely agree that this is not rigorous. And I think it cannot even be, in principle, rigorous, because the whole issue boils down to an evaluative statement, which cannot take a truth value. No matter how you would approach the task of determining the best website to look for a movie rating, you cannot have the rigor and degree of certainty that you would have in a well-established topic of physics or chemistry. This is because of the evaluative nature of the issue: you cannot look into nature and come up with a universal criterion for what movie ratings distribution should really look like. You have to make assumptions and build upon them! P.S.: I mentioned explicitly in the article the arbitrary nature of the 3\u20137 interval, and that this may weaken the argumentation. That\u2019s why I have provided a second argument for recommending the metascore: is the least correlated with Fandango.
