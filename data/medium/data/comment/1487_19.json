At least they showed the good sense not to send a civil rights lawyer to DC, read community activist, to defend students indoctrinated in being snowflakes. I smell an opportunist rat here, this guy was a registered Republican until March of 2016 and probably saw an opportunity to ride the ESTABLISHMENT ANTI TRUMP BANDWAGON to victory as a Dem and got burned.
