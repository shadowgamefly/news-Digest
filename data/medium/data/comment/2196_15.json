I have often admired those who are content with their circumstances and who quietly bring about positive change through humble projects. And it does seem as though we are plagued by obsessive ambition, but I think this is the very thing driving human advancement and so this urge just needs to be better placed. Instead of the relatively modern phenomenon of fame-for-the-sake-of-fame, we should aim to be \u2018somebody\u2019 who contributes to society, whether it be scientifically, artistically, compassionately or otherwise. Again, love the article and a thought that I have enjoyed ruminating on. ", "name": "2196_15", "id": "d88e46557c95"}
