{"name": "1556_13", "child": "", "content": "What Gorsuch meant, and you seem to deliberately ignore, is that judges, at ALL levels are supposed to leave their personal politics and opinions behind when they don the robe and sit at the bench; and judge according to the dictates of the WRITTEN law, not their feelings! The \u201chyperpartisanship\u201d as you label it, is a DIRECT result of judges at all levels LEGISLATING from their benches based on foreign laws and feelings, and/or what they THINK the law should say or mean, rather than what it DOES say! THAT has to STOP! It\u2019s not their job, and never was. They issue opinions, in the case of SCOTUS, which have often enough proven to be foolishly wrong, or rulings based on actual evidence and the written law (Constitution and US Code), nothing more.
