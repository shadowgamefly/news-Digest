I know that the recent announcement has most of us on edge and of course the fact that talent had to be let go is beyond tragic. But, the thing is that I would never be the writer I am today if I hadn\u2019t been introduced to this platform by a friend back in 2013 when it was still in its experimental phase. Since then, I tasked myself with using this space as my preferred playground\u200a\u2014\u200awhere I can run free and discover exactly why I love to write. I know why I love to write. And I definitely understand why I do it without expectations\u200a\u2014\u200amonetary or otherwise. But, at some point something has to give and I am ready for the next step. In the meantime\u200a\u2014\u200aI hope you continue to maximize the benefits of Medium and I am so honored that my words have somehow given you something to hold on to at the right moment. Readers are vital to my survival and I am surely adding you to that distinguished list. ", "title": "", "parent": "551", "creatorid": "2dc2523531fa", "id": "a8ddba08941"}
