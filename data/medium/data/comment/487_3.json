{"name": "487_3", "child": "", "content": "Admittedly, not a swole woman, but\u2026I think HIIT has convinced many people that lifting weights while you\u2019re out of breath is the norm. Or that \u201chardcore\u201d is the only way to get fit. HIIT can be very useful, but at the moment it\u2019s doing more harm than good (at least in NYC!). No one at the gym is setting personal records in the squat or deadlift after doing 25 burpees. If you\u2019re starting out lifting, save the \u201chardcore\u201d mentality for the boutique fitness joints (and if you really want to lift weights, I don\u2019t see how you can do HIIT more than once a week).
