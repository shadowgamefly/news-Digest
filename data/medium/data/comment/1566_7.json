{"name": "1566_7", "child": "", "content": "Remember that Gorsuch unanimously received the ABA\u2019s highest rating so if you want just one small example of the Democrats astounding hypocrisy in this matter just look at what happened when \u201cPresident Bush ended the American Bar Association\u2019s traditional role in helping the White House screen prospective nominees to the Supreme Court and other federal courts.\u201d Mr. Leahy and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote to the White House declaring that the ABA\u2019s rating system represented the \u201cgold standard\u201d by which prospective nominees to the federal bench should be judged. The two Democrats warned in a press release that \u201c[l]imiting the ABA\u2019s role will harm the process of selecting and confirming federal judges and threatens the quality and integrity of the federal bench. As members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d they announced, \u201cwe will soon meet with the ABA to discuss how best to reincorporate them into the process.\u201d But now both Leahy and Shumer are essentially saying that ABA\u2019a ratings no longer matter and they\u2019ll block the extremely well qualified Gorsuch solely because he is Trump\u2019s nominee. Amazing isn\u2019t it? ", "title": "", "parent": "1566", "creatorid": "646615db4e96", "id": "67217767fbce"}
