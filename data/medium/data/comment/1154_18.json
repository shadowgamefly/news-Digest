I love \u2018there is no bad weather, only improper clothing.\u2019 Reminds me of Ani, who had some sort of digestion thing a few years ago, where her food wasn\u2019t processing/being digested. She ballooned out despite pumpkin and yogurt and spinach. She could barely waddle. We finally gave up on our vet and dragged her to the pet ER, where she insisted on stumbling about the waiting room, giving everyone a happy tail and a kiss, if they\u2019d let her. She couldn\u2019t even sit down at that point, but she never lost her bounce. She was given meds and of course shot dark chunky horror all over every inch of our car two hours later, but I mostly remember how being miserable just wasn\u2019t in her makeup. She never cried. She didn\u2019t whimper. Your line about weather made me remember that some of us wear a certain outfit every day because we don\u2019t know there are other clothes. \u2764 ", "title": "", "parent": "1154", "creatorid": "1a63cf04da58", "id": "db001c00ae37"}
