{"name": "1771_20", "child": "", "content": "When I started reading this I thought you were going to use the military as an example of the separation of Americans from those who serve in a military culture to those who don\u2019t. I appreciate your points of how the good things about this military culture are now eroding. I have supported volunteer-based tutor/mentor programs that connect volunteers from diverse work, age, race, social backgrounds with youth who live in highly segregated poverty neighborhoods of Chicago, because of how on-going programs serve as a form of \u201cbridging social capital. I don\u2019t find many who talk about mentoring from this perspective, or who provide the resources to make ment0r-rich programs available and long-lasting in more places. I\u2019d like to find morediscussion, and maps/visualizations showing other strategies that build and sustain ties across silos in our society.
