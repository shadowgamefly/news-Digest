Wired\u2018s wording was this: \u201c\u2026TRS-80, one of the first affordable personal computers and one of the first devices RadioShack ever produced.\u00a0\u2026 John Draper, the phone phreaker known as \u201cCaptain Crunch,\u201d hacked his way into free long-distance calls using a Touch Tone dialer he bought from RadioShack. Woz bought one too, and he says it cost him a fortune. He used it for the now-infamous Blue Box\u201d To me, this said that the expensive thing (the computer) is what they used for the bluebox. But that\u2019s not a very logical choice to the average nerd (unless you\u2019re a nerd that has just unboxed that expensive $599 machine and really want to prove a point). So I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re right: I\u2019d place my money on this having been a modded TouchTone keypad, which\u200a\u2014\u200aif nothing else\u200a\u2014\u200acould be salvaged from a $54.95 RadioShack phone in 1979. And such a keypad fits in that museum photo. Thanks for pointing this out. ", "title": "", "parent": "602", "creatorid": "289b3780519b", "id": "34996905a925"}
