It provides the basis for building a very powerful DSL for expressing your domain that nicely models both the transactional information (events) and the business process definitions (contracts). The end result is that you can model a lot of ERP systems with very little code and strong compile-time guarantees about correct bookkeeping. The main academic article is this one: POETS\u00a0: Process-oriented Enterprise Transaction Systems. / Henglein, Fritz; Stefansen, Christian Oskar Erik; Simonsen, Jakob Grue; Larsen, Ken Friis. In: Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, Vol. 78, \u21165, 2009, p. 381\u2013401. There are a number of articles from this group from DIKU at the University of Copenhagen. It originated in research into next-generation ERP archictures for Microsoft ERP / financial products such as Dynamics and NAV.
