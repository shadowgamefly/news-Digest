{"name": "706_17", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019d have to explore the Sketch file\u2019s zip format for a better idea of what you\u2019re driving at here, but the question that comes to mind for me is whether designers may in the future be able to make changes to Sketch files that are instantly reflected in the app\u2019s code base (perhaps with a build step) as applied style changes (in CSS, etc) that originate from changes to these JSON files. There is a lot of friction between design and development to making small, incremental improvements to reusable components (aka symbols, classes). And if designers could start essentially committing these changes themselves to an app\u2019s stylesheets, that would be a big win for the workflow. I also wonder how you envision Zeplin and other similar design-developer collaboration tools leveraging the file format?
