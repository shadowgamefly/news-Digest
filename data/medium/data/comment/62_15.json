{"id": "df892afd9b4d", "content": "I visited your website and I am so glad that you have taken the initiative of teaching kids the value of money. However, I find it so wrong that you should attach a monetary value to a household chore, I feel that creating such a model will only make the child selfish or opportunist. I have never attached a monetary value or a reward for my children to do what needs to be done\u200a\u2014\u200aneither have I insisted upon them achieving a certain target to get what they wished for. These are children, not pets that need to be trained with a goody every time they perform a trick. Children taught this way will grow up with a mindset where they will expect to be rewarded for everything they do for others and which will only result in a selfish society. Sorry for being so critical, but this is what I felt. ", "creatorid": "1a0aee74b3dd", "title": "", "parent": "62", "child": "", "name": "62_15"}
