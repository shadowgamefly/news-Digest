I was very very interested in the comment you made when you said \u201cOn top of that, often too many people are involved in making a decision. You don\u2019t usually want to make a decision in a meeting with 20 people. That\u2019s inefficient. So the person in charge of the meeting chooses who will be present\u200a\u2014\u200aand too bad for the others.\u201d This is a very interesting case for me. I am a web developer from the UK, I do consulting for many companies and find this is commonly an issue with teams. Every single time a decision is made on a project I state to the company that anyone who is involved on the project must be there, wether thats via skype or getting everyone into a big hall room, it is essential, otherwise how do these people know what has been spoken about and why those decisions were made. I really enjoyed this post, thanks and all the best with your company and the journey it takes! Keep up the great work my friend!
