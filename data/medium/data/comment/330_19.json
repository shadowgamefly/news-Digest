From the IEEE Spectrum article: Despite never having publicly demonstrated a practical working prototype, uBeam has been the recipient of millions of dollars in venture capital. [\u2026] But physicists have long questioned the practicality of uBeam\u2019s plans to deliver electricity to mobile devices using ultrasound. Many of their concerns were outlined in an IEEE Spectrum article in November; Reynolds\u2019 blog echoes some of the points made in that piece. Paul Reynolds\u2019 is a world expert. He has over 20-years of experience in the field. Meredith Perry is\u2026 She\u2019s a young founder in an industry that mindlessly worships young founders. And here readers seem to mindlessly worship anything a VC writes. And if it's Paul Graham then the words are treated as infallible doctrine of the most holy kind. From looking at the IEEE Spectrum article and Paul Reynolds\u2019 posts it appears that this is not a \u201cPR crisis\u201d but rather a start-up that cannot deliver the promised technology, because, well, physics.
