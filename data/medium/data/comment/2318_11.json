In my world, there are so many things/people that require my attention that it\u2019s hard for me to slow down at times. And when I do, I either feel guilty or in the back of my mind, I know there are still things that I need to do. I\u2019m a mother of 4 children, a wife, and entrepreneur. So, it\u2019s tough. I feel like I\u2019m just waiting for the day that my children are older and more self sufficient, so things will be easier for me.
