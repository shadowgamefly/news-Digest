{"name": "1281_1", "child": "", "content": "This was a lovely story; one that I could relate to. My only problem is that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the dog. She let the dog out but did she ever let it back in? Perhaps that was implied but as a genuine dog-lover I needed dog closure. As I finished the story I smiled and that is a sign of a good story but in the back of my noggin I was wondering about the dog. As she typed away on her novel was the dog still out in the yard feeling abandoned? This probably says more about me than anything else. I\u2019m a doggie freak. To me, dogs are people, too. I\u2019m still wondering what happened to the dog\u2026. ", "title": "", "parent": "1281", "creatorid": "40abe946fcd0", "id": "515d9bb438df"}
