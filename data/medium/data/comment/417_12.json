Microsoft saw that it had a business case and the cash to make the synergies happen! LinkedIn as a standalone was destined to be taken over. It had no process integration with businesses. Just think of how Microsoft\u2019s CRM can suddenly make B2B Marketing on LinkedIn transparent. It creates room for what Microsoft failed to create all along: A walled garden for advertising.

I cannot tell if letting Yammer die a slow death or using it as a background layer to LinkedIn as an add-on benefit for intra-company communication is better, now that they got Teams. But one thing is for sure: Microsoft did not spend 26 billion USD on a single guy with a struggling use-case\u00a0and\u00a0no\u00a0way\u00a0to\u00a0go\u00a0except\u00a0Merger\u00a0and\u00a0Acquisition specialists!
