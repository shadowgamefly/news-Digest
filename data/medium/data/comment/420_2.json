{"name": "420_2", "child": "", "content": "This is a request for Sandra Upson. I was wondering if you could provide some insight to a female, budding iOS Engineer who is new to the tech field as to why/how you were able to overlook that awful paragraph about San Francisco women in Chaos Monkeys in order to recommend it? I read your review this afternoon and it\u2019s still bothering me this evening. I know it\u2019s just one paragraph in one book by one guy, but the book was published and is getting some traction (it\u2019s also in MIT Tech Review\u2019s best-of year-end list, and it got two favorable reviews in the NYTimes). I know there\u2019s unseemly elements in every industry, but this was blatant enough a slap in the face to women in San Francisco and tech to give me pause. Not pause in my desire to work in tech, but a pause to reassess what kind of resources I\u2019m going to need while I\u2019m there. I guess I\u2018m hoping for reassurance that Mart\u00ednez\u2019s sentiment isn\u2019t popular or prevalent in the industry even if it is apparently allowable, but any feedback you could provide would be appreciated.
