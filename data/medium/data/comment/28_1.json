{"name": "28_1", "child": "", "content": "Russ was out of bounds on that first rebound. Still probably the MVP. I hate to say that, because I feel like it almost endorses the B.S. shenanigans of stat-padding and absent-minded defense that he no doubt participates in. But Russ\u2019s end-of-game dominance and every-minute intensity (while being a Usage monster and playing every game) make him *just* edge out Harden and Kawhi, for me. I would\u2019ve picked Harden three weeks ago, but his wrist injury and relatively poor play down the stretch, coupled with Russell\u2019s complete frenzied mayhem, has made the difference. That brutal three-game stretch two weeks ago when the Rockets lost to the Blazers and twice to the Warriors might\u2019ve been the most significant period. Harden shot like 25% and they lost convincingly, right when he had a chance to show he had made the Rockets legit contenders.
