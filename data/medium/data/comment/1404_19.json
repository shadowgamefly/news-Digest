{"name": "1404_19", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s closer from a Flock to a tribe, because the conference would be a good time-sensitive event that would temporarily rally people on social media for its duration (via shares, tweets, coverage, etc) and then after the event it could either transition to ecosystem or a tribe depending on the intimacy level of the community. The reason I say flock and not single serve, is single serve are really rapid one-off transactions and I think the act of co-creating would necessitate a collective gathering that would make it fit that category. Does that make sense? I\u2019m using your question to help stress test this framework, and I think that works, but check my thinking and let me know!
