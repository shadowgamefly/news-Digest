{"name": "344_8", "child": "", "content": "As someone who spent most of his career in sales leadership roles at the likes of Cisco, Compaq, Autodesk and others, I was sold when you said mobile-first CRM (and with it all related features of voice I/O, AI, chat, etc.) If there\u2019s one thing salespeople hate, it\u2019s having to enter data in CRM systems. And if there is something that sales leaders like, is to be able to quickly get sales data, both historical and forecasts, for planing and making decisions. Back at Cisco, where accurate forecasting was a religion, salespeople had to update and *submit* their forecasts weakly (yes, we had a \u201csubmit\u201d button). But CRM softwares always lagged behind and felt like you\u2019re using a DOS-based system in a Windows era, or a Windows system in a browser era, or a browser system in a mobile era. And hence sales people hated it even more. Plus, of course, the fact that if you can\u2019t do it on the fly, it means data to be input is going to accumulate, and the burden of data entry is just going to increase. One thing would be great though, if they figure out a way to securely integrate the chatting tools people most commonly use rather than adding a new one. Because even with companies who adopt Salesforce, how many of their salespeople actually use Chatter? ", "title": "", "parent": "344", "creatorid": "2cce015a288d", "id": "70280c947c66"}
