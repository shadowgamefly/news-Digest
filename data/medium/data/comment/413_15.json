So if these police were beating the hell out of the protesters and if Miss (yes, I called her miss on purpose) Jenner in between blows gave the cop a remarkably unshaken Pepsi, then sure, let\u2019s talk about police brutality. But these cops? They were just standing there. Not aggressively. No weapons drawn, no riot shields, no dogs, no helmets. Doesn\u2019t even look like they were wearing body armor. They could have just as easily been there to protect the protesters. Maybe this was a a pro skub and a bunch of anti skub were waiting to get their licks in. Or maybe it was an anti skub and the pro skub were foiled! Who knows! That was the intent. Or so I imagine. Pepsi has a long history of boundary pushing ads. It really isn\u2019t that complicated. And as far as ads go, yeah, it was vapid, but so what? It is trying to appeal to that very same cis-non-normative-fluid-queer-non binary demographic who want to be involved in something. You know, the same idiots who shop at urban outfitters of think Wil Wheaton has important things to say. Maybe that last one was just people on medium. Hard to tell sometimes.
