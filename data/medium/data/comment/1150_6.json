{"name": "1150_6", "child": "", "content": "Thank you, Kari for putting mental health conditions on par with other illnesses that can be treated IF DIAGNOSED correctly. We cannot let the Prison Industrial Complex be the \u201cdoctor of first resort\u201d. We cannot expect the men & women who serve as first responders to have no other option besides bringing mentally ill people to jail. I suggest that we all need to lobby for local governments to provide health care for their medically ill people. To depend on the current administration to put any resources into health care for mentally ill people is what I would call \u201ccrazy\u201d. Congratulations on having introduced legislation to address health care for mentally ill people. I\u2019m going to see about trying that here in Georgia.
