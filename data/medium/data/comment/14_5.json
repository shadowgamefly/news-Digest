{"id": "ae4bc7dcc555", "content": "I just finished a book of quotations (\u201cStar Wars Wisdom\u201d) after spending 20 years compiling, and editing down, a compendium of enlightening quotes from numerous authors. However, while editing down the massive set of quotes over the past year, I found that my listing of attribution to specific books was inadequate. In this, Google Books was both a lifesaver and a revelation. It was through Google Books\u200a\u2014\u200aalone\u200a\u2014\u200athat I could attribute and recommend these wonderful (however forgotten) books to my own readers. Thank you, Google Books. Keep up the fight. And to Jude Watson, author of an now-officially-sublimated series of Star Wars books for young readers: You, I have discovered, are the wisest of all of the Star Wars\u2019 authors. You once wrote to answer my young daughter\u2019s question that it was easier to write wisely than to live wisely. I won\u2019t disagree, but the combined wisdom of your writings is truly profound, and as I found, over and over again, that the source of endless quotes offering boundless wisdom, was you, I am most grateful for your work and the positive effects it has had on my daughter, on me, and I am very sure, on many, many others. Thank you so very much. ", "creatorid": "3f228ed1c8c5", "title": "", "parent": "14", "child": "", "name": "14_5"}
