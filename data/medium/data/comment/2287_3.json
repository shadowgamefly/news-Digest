The only pie I have eaten of your number one ranking is chess, and though I do enjoy it, I would rather have a concord grape pie than any other pie that has ever existed in the existence of existing. Failing a concord grape pie I would eat a Grandma\u2019s pie. That is, my number one ranked pie is any pie baked by my maternal grandmother. She is no longer in the pie making game, however, so I rarely eat pie that even ranks because nobody seems to make concord grape pie. If anybody knows where I can find a good concord grape pie I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a slice of it today. I miss my grandma. ", "name": "2287_3", "id": "fd7d86cbdb8d"}
