{"name": "1716_2", "child": "", "content": "Interesting! I had to click your link and read more about it. Now I am on the web looking for more info. I believe my upbringing is the source of the majority of my habits. I was raised to have a habit of making my bed for example and I was also raised to avoid conflict and not argue. I would love to change that. Not that I want to argue, but I would love to learn how to engage in healthy confrontation and not continue the habit of backing down, always feeling I am in-superior and fearful all the time. I dont even know what I am fearful of! Being wrong? Being rejected? I am seriously working hard at discovering this and discovering the source and making changes for the better!
