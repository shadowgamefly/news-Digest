{"name": "756_20", "child": "", "content": "It is so disturbing to keep hearing, oh, it is so easy to set up https on everything, just use GoEncrypt, it\u2019s free. Well, most web hosts don\u2019t support GoEncrypt, I imagine because they\u2019d lose money from selling their own over-priced SSL certificates. I can\u2019t just move all 20 of my websites to another ISP so easily. Please help those of us whose ISP\u2019s are too greedy to allow GoEncrypt to know what affordable ISPs are out there. I hear bad things about all of them and it is pretty stressful. Although, I guess at least they at least won\u2019t hold our privacy and security hostage so they can make a buck off of us, so we\u2019re at least ahead of the game on that! If you were poor and hosting other very poor nonprofits/activist groups, what reseller hosting would you use? Thank you.
