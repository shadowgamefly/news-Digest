{"name": "597_19", "child": "", "content": "Wait, really? Isn\u2019t this the premise of The Dating Game a la 1965? I sure hope we\u2019d have come a long way since then, baby. But, apparently, not. Women can\u2019t build a better dating app. Men can\u2019t either. The goal of these apps is the same: to meet a person you might be compatible with. To narrow down the menu of options a tiny, little bit until you find someone that you maybe sorta may kinda be into. But are they really narrowing it down any more effectively than if you were to approach any random stranger in any random bar you like to frequent? You and said stranger already have at least one thing in common: you like the same bar. Maybe you live in the same neighborhood or town. Maybe you have common acquaintances. Maybe you both enjoy bourbon cocktails made with artisan maraschino cherries. Really, aren\u2019t the odds about the same? In person, you can perform an immediate and practically automated assessment of who they are as a human being: what kind of shoes are they wearing, what do their fingernails look like, how is their posture and demeanor? These are things not easily found on a dating app but instantly apparent in one quick glance from the next barstool over. My point is: dating apps aren\u2019t the answer. They are a means to an end. But there are many other ways to get to that end, and apps are probably not even the best route. Put your damn phone down and look at the guy sitting next to you on the bus. Ask him what he\u2019s reading. Maybe if he answers well, you\u2019ll get the opportunity to ask two more questions. ", "title": "", "parent": "597", "creatorid": "679fdd17b604", "id": "26af28c661c6"}
