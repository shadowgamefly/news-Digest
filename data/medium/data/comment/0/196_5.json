Hardy.All the points mentioned by you need to be done before 8 AM in order to have a meaningful,well balanced day. I would like to add one more activity to this list.I always try to spend some time to create a \u201cno-to-do\u201d list for that day before 8 AM.This list will be a rough skeleton of all those activities on which I do not want to waste time during my day.This can also contain items which are not of priority to be done on that day. This list helps me to prioritize the day and derive maximum productivity out of that day.It also helps me to keep a short and sweet \u201cto-do\u201d list for that day\u00a0.
