I know I\u2019ve answered ones that ask how to recover from a bad breakup a hundred times or more, yet I\u2019ll answer the next one and the one after that. There is an actual process that will help you through. The real reason I started doing it, though, was that there were hundreds of questions on there from people who had been fired or treated terribly at their jobs. Every one of those had five to ten answers that said that it was the worker\u2019s fault, that employers are logical people who had the company\u2019s best interests at heart and that if there were any fault, it was always the worker\u2019s. What bullshit. I started writing on there from the worker\u2019s perspective. After spending over 50 years in the workforce, (yes, since I was 7) I can tell you that there are at least as many lunatic bosses as there are workers. Even if you\u2019re the bad guy, as a worker you have to look after your own interests in that situation. I tell people how to do it. I average out around 30k views a month and it\u2019s satisfying that people read my stuff, but it\u2019s also satisfying to help those who need it when they need it.
