We\u2019ve been seeing our numbers of students majoring or minoring in mathematics slump\u200a\u2014 more like plummet\u200a\u2014 over the last 3\u20134 years and I just spent a year leading a group to study this phenomenon. While I am cautious about making an analogy between higher ed and the food business, there\u2019s certainly a lot about our \u201cproduct\u201d (programs in Mathematics) that sounds like what you are saying about these food products. Especially the line about fax machines. ", "creatorid": "c57e507ff27", "timestamp": 1492348049187, "child": "", "username": "roberttalbert"}
