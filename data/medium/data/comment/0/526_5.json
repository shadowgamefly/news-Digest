I\u2019m an atheist and this point reminded me of one of the things I feel about any religion that teaches good morals such as this is. I feel I don\u2019t need a religion to tell me how to be a good person. I believe I was born a good person with good morals, reinforced by how my non-religious parents brought me up. Being kind to others and treating them how I want to be treated comes naturally to me. I don\u2019t do it because I\u2019m following the rules of a religion that tell me I should do it. That\u2019s one reason that Christianity would feel irrelevant to me\u200a\u2014\u200aby telling me to behave how I would naturally behave anyway.
