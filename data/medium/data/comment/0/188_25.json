It\u2019s primary purpose is to increase the bottom line\u2013not enrich people\u2019s lives, no matter what they say. If a business isn\u2019t making money and growing, it has to change, or it dies. People come and go, it\u2019s the nature of it. I think the point is to be aware of it and realize that there is no reason to invest your entire being into a business that can\u2019t and won\u2019t give you a return on your investment. If you have an idea that you think is worth more than your salary, don\u2019t give it to your company. They won\u2019t give back anything near what you gave to them. Work your ass off in your spare time and make it happen. And, whatever you do, don\u2019t drink the Kool-Aid. Most people have no idea that what they have to offer and provide to a company is so much greater than their salary. All that Value is sucked out the top of the org through a few small hoses. It\u2019s like a hookah\u2013you are the smoke. Don\u2019t be the smoke. ", "creatorid": "ba7f4b4f6f03", "timestamp": 1452811691853, "child": "", "username": "LeviVoelz"}
