We don\u2019t see the consequences of our poor performance in real time so don\u2019t have the urgency to change. Also if we do decide to make changes we implement them as \u2018projects\u2019 or \u2018programmes\u2019. Because this change is not systemic and doesn\u2019t address the whole, we end up tinkering round the edges and never really creating innovative or sustainable change. The environment issue also applies. We rely heavily on benchmarking against other organisations and start to see success as being in line with our peers. I would argue that benchmarking is a deeply unhelpful activity which hinders progress for organisations and encourages low expectations. Insightful and useful article. Thanks.
