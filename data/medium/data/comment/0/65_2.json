He\u2019s amazing, great, etc. but he could never take over and score like the other GOATS do. In the crunch, we\u2019ve seen him disappear in a few game 7s and other key stretches\u200a\u2014\u200alike his first against the Mavs, several shellackings from the Spurs, and even including the almighty 3\u20131 comeback where Kyrie finally hit the bucket which Lebron had already missed several times. Is Lebron even in anybody\u2019s top-10 to take the final shot in a close game with the highest stakes? Sure, his all-around game is great, IQ is high, physical athleticism is probably the best too\u2026 but he\u2019s not an elite scorer because he\u2019s too often lacked a fearless killer instinct. He\u2019ll settle for long jumpers, and gets frazzled when his only real move\u200a\u2014\u200athe bull rush\u200a\u2014\u200afails. Hot take out.
