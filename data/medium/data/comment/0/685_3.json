Selman, a cognitive psychologist, in his theory of perspective taking, through Alvin Tilley in his book called The Measure of Man and Woman, that by the age of 13, the person must realize that communication and mutual role thinking does not always resolve disputes over rival values; one just simply cannot communicate away rival values. When I asked a friend on Selman\u2019s statement, they told me that values aren\u2019t always set in stone; these are ulterior motives. Values can change, and this is facilitated through communication. There might be cases which come from miscommunication, but not all cases of conflict come from miscommunication, contrary to what many a business article says as of today\u2019s writing. I now wonder what\u2019s your take, given the clarifications? ", "creatorid": "be8e71ebc9ed", "timestamp": 1483588766729, "child": "", "username": "rafaelcases"}
