This is a prime example of why we need each other to to make it in this life. No man or woman is an island unto themselves. It reminds me of a celebrity golf event I wanted to do for my first startup. I had no money, no experience and no connections. So I moved forward by partnering with people who had the resources I needed. My first task was to find someone who could get a meeting with the CEO of Healthy Child Healthy World charity. The CEO at the time happened to be Steven Spielbergs\u2019 son. We accomplished that part of the mission, and and I realized that once you get through the initial fear\u00a0and\u00a0just\u00a0start\u00a0doing\u00a0with\u00a0less\u00a0thinking, it gets alot easier and things start to open up. I then went to contact any celebrity. com and sent messages to any celebrities that had interest aligned with ours for the event. So any celebrity that was a supporter of our troops and wanted to protect our children\u00a0from\u00a0harmful\u00a0exposure to toxins, I sent a personalized message. It was a lot, but drawing on my door to door sales experience I knew it was\u00a0all about the law of averages. Knock on enough doors and I would get the participants I needed. We landed David James Elliot from the hit series J.A.G., and 14 year NBA veteran Gerald Wilkins (the brother of Dominique Wilkins the human highlight) Getting the money together to host the event at Trump National was an event in itself but it showed me I can do anything I put my mind to. I set up a meeting with a friend in Germany, which was where I was living at the time and he invested the money needed to make this baby fly. The event was awesome and my investor made a profit!
