She comes home from wherever, drops her keys wherever, and a few hours later blasts her voice through the house, \u201cmy fucking brain isn\u2019t working!\u201d She has an iPhone. iPhones come packed with more than adequate productivity apps (Notes, Reminders, Calender, and Clock). She doesn\u2019t use them. She depends on her brain. My mom, I guess, just doesn\u2019t understand how the brain works. The brain isn\u2019t built to efficiently remember where we put things.
