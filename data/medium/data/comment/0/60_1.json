In order to get into those situations, the team has to be in a close game. You tend to be in close games with teams that are comparable to you. The Knicks have been bad during that time, while the Heat and Cavs have been championship level good. While I haven\u2019t looked at the games you are looking at(and if you have them, I\u2019d love to see them), it would stand to reason that Carmelo was 8 for 30 in game winning shots against bad teams, while LeBron was 9 for 29 in game winning shots against good teams. Weight this by opposing teams winning percentage, and you\u2019ll have a better gage on whether they are similar.
