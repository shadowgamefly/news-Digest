It\u2019s also worth noting that Trump profits from the time spent at his properties in a number of ways (Uncle Sam pays for accommodations for Trump\u2019s staff and security, Trump adds value to his patrons with his presence, enabling him to charge higher fees, etc.). He even shamelessly markets his properties and his businesses every chance he gets (even a conversation about his attack on Syria includes a blatant commercial for the chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago). And, of course, every property he travels to gets a ton of free publicity from the media. Obama never did any of this at all, let alone do it in such a flagrant way that\u2019s not even subtle. Both of the above were detailed in this article. What wasn\u2019t mentioned\u2014 and is also noteworthy as a stark difference between Trump and Obama\u200a\u2014\u200ais the hypocrisy. Trump was a strong and relentless critic of Obama\u2019s personal travel and his golf activities while he was in office. And Trump promised that when he was President, he would be sticking to the White House and working. He hasn\u2019t. Instead, his travel and golf playing has far exceeded that of Obama. Obama didn\u2019t make similar criticisms of his predecessor. ", "creatorid": "76f21f3db847", "timestamp": 1492203321939, "child": "", "username": "victorialambhatch"}
