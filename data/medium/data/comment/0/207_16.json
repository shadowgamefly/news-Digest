I\u2019m a web developer in progress, I\u2019m still learning and looking for more experience on the field. I always liked getting fit, doing exercises and playing sports. I truly love it, with all my heart. I\u2019m still fighting against procrastination as well as many people. The thing is that I have found a way to beat it. What it is? This sentence. I learnt that when I workout and spend some time getting physical, my mind is kind of released of problems and things that can bother me. Thanks to exercises, I have more coordination in both mentally and physically, is like having my mind cleaned! I\u2019ve improved on my field too but I have to keep studying as well. People always escape from going to the gym or doing exercises because they procrastinate. The key that I learnt is CONFIDENCE!! When you are self-confident there\u2019s nothing that can stop you from doing the things you like and love!!
