Reading you is like taking a master class in propaganda. What you have just written is yet another example of you refusing to engage with your opposition. You have essentially asserted that analyzing political positions is bad (\u201coverthinking\u201d, \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d) and that, instead, we need to just go with our gut (\u201cthe answers are very simple\u201d). Anybody who actually listens to this is doomed to fall to the Law of Unintended Consequences. The answers are very simple, aren\u2019t they? Copy what successful societies have done. Give people public healthcare, education, transport, finance. This is sophistry. Just wanted to point that out for anybody who read this and nodded. It\u2019s not an argument, it\u2019s an assertion, and thus is Begging the Question. Moreover, strong courts and property rights are the defining characteristics of successful societies, not socialism. That is, you can find socialism in many places in the world. Cuba, Venezuela, and North Korea all have Umair\u2019s prescribed policies. They are not remotely successful, though. Europe, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia all have (relatively) strong property rights, though.
