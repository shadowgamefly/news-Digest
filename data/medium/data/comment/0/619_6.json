I love your work too and I agree about the fiction issue (as do many others, I\u2019ve seen a lot of similar complaint and I passed mine on in the Medium member-only group). I love Bond\u2019s work, as an example, but he disappeared and stop publishing on Medium, while his work is fantastic and written for someone like me who have seen what he\u2019s writing about. He speaks to a whole generation of people. I praised your writing before, so I will not repeat that here. I do hope Medium recognizes the enormous potential of fiction and I do hope it will finally begin to consider our opinion and needs. As for $5, I agree, but they should have packaged it differently.
