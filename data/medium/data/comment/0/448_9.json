This is patently not the case. What you are seeing IS the norm. He will not stop issuing executive orders a week or a month from now\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has a pen that is not going to run out of ink any time soon, and he sees no reason on earth that he shouldn\u2019t use it continuously *for his entire term*. Why not? Who the hell is going to stop him? He can bang out EO\u2019s faster than any court or deliberative body could hope to deal with them. It\u2019ll take them months to deal with any ONE of the disasters he can create, and in that time he\u2019ll create a thousand more. The GOP congress can\u2019t legislate around him or impeach him without torpedoing all the winnings they see on the table before them, and they won\u2019t until the country is in complete disarray and people are rioting in the streets. This isn\u2019t a negotiating tactic, it isn\u2019t some clever ploy\u200a\u2014\u200ait is executive Shock & Awe, and its NOT GOING TO STOP.
