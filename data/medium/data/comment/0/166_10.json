You go through the process of trying to send them the messages like FB says, and you get blocked when you ask them to take it down. You later find it\u2019s like going down the rabbit hole and the \u201ccool kids\u201d think that because \u201ceveryone\u201d is doing it, it\u2019s okay to steal content and slap a new name on it. Especially because the \u201cuniverse\u201d or some made up shit they justify now owns your article. You remind them about the DMCA and oh yeah the \u201crules\u201d that we still have even if it is on the interwebs, and then you dig further to find out there is a team of these people working together making money off your work and many others.
