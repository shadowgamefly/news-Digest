I hope you do not mind me reaching out of the blue here. I just set up a Facebook group for writers like you and myself that want to build an authentic tribe of readers on Medium. What I really wanted to do is gather and serve conscious business founders who write on Medium at a dramatically different level. To preserve the safety, impact, and depth of connection and growth of the group, yet bring more people into the conversation in a way that was sustainable not just for months, but potentially for years and beyond. It is up to 100 members and I think you would add tremendous value to the group. Let me know if you are interested and I\u2019ll add you. With Gratitude, Benjamin Foley ", "creatorid": "81eb80675997", "timestamp": 1484931738737, "child": "", "username": "benjaminjfoley"}
