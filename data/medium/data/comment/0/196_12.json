Until I spent a few years with my wife (a LCPC) who well fits the introvert\u2019s mould, I never really fully appreciated an introvert\u2019s world/view. This peek into another worldview has expanded my own and I\u2019ve been relooking at pretty much everything with a somewhat new appreciation. These prescriptions for how to get into action (this being very nice one) feels/seems to me to be a very \u201cextrovertedish\u201d version. While I\u2019m not suggesting a simplistic model of Extroverts are \u201cAction Folks\u201d and Introverts are \u201cSedentary Folks\u201d and one should be action orientated or laid back depending on where you are on an Extro/Intro continuum this general formula that is put forth in many place lacks intricacies, complexities, and breath I\u2019d like to see in this public space. I think it\u2019s the \u201cEvery Person\u201d in the title that prompts this writing. Thanks! ", "creatorid": "ddb212f02659", "timestamp": 1491915521801, "child": "", "username": "bshanfield_68992"}
