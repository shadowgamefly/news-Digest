We are drowning in baristas and uber drivers. In all affection and respect, sister, you need to get off the web and get out of town: America is doing fine. It\u2019s only urbane liberals, trying desperately to keep their useless projects funded by someone else\u2019s wealth, who want you to believe the country is coming apart at the seams. What amazes me, is that the most successful and powerful liberal politician in our history, name of Franklin Roosevelt, made his way into office and through a far, far worse economic crisis than anything today even remotely resembles, by being an optimist, not only refusing to submit to fear and panic (even as his polio was secretly making him a cripple all the while), but admonishing the American people that \u201cthe only thing to fear is fear itself.\u201d That man got more social programs and more mass-infrastructure projects and more revolutionary ideas made into reality (not to mention prevailing in a global war in less than four years after a horrific defeat of an entire oceanic fleet in a surprise attack) than anyone vainly proclaiming the leftist cause today by propagating fear rather than arguing against it like an adult, would ever dare to claim. What disappoints me about this tack you are taking, Jhagi, is that you are adopting the language of fear, seeing parallels and history repeating itself around every corner and behind every tree, but absolutely failing to recognize that in those times the way that the most fearful things were defeated, began with refusing to fear them. I don\u2019t think you are any no-platforming, window-smashing leftist at all, so why are you writing like one these days?
