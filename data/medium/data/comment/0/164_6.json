Firstly, it doesn\u2019t recognise the city I\u2019m in (Birmingham, uk\u200a\u2014\u200ajust the 1 million people here, nothing major). It does tell me of neighbouring towns and cities, but when, for example, telling me I\u2019m 39km from Worcester, England, it also has an entry for Worcestor, Masschusetts (also 39km, apparently).
