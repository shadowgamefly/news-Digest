If you don\u2019t follow the team, you won\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve dealt with pretty constant injury problems, the most recent being the loss of Bradley for 16 games. (Well more recent was not having Olynyk and Horford for the loss against the Clippers). They\u2019re only now starting to integrate their preferred lineups and the game against the Warriors shows what they can bring at close to 100%, while some of their young players are showing real growth. With their depth and defensive potential, they could definitely make the ECF. After that, well, they have a puncher\u2019s chance. They do match up well with GS.
