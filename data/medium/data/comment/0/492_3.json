Do you still recognize their contributions based on merit and are they able to earn more than their peers? If yes, doesn\u2019t this create tension or at least questions from others? If no, aren\u2019t the high performers more likely to leave? I still have a hard time with the idea that everyone at the same position should be earning the same salary since in my experience, not everyone is really producing the same amount. Even in your company, you note that female employees often outproduce their male counterparts\u200a\u2014\u200aif so, shouldn\u2019t they be paid more for that effort? Equality doesn\u2019t necessarily mean fair does it? Kudos for what you are doing, I enjoy hearing about efforts to break the mold like this and do something others aren\u2019t willing to do.
