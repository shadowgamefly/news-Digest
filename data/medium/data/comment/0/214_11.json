Was so particular about writing, then. Now when I reflect, it is really surprising for me to believe how I must have managed to be so punctual, with all those responsibilities. I do not know actually when and how I gradually stopped that lovely activity. May be when I got busier than the busiest\u00a0???! But anyways, thanks for reminding me to get back to journaling, Darius. Journaling is like creating a private tunnel into a fairy-tale world of your own, where, you cannot otherwise return physically, in the days to come. It is the most interesting activity of life.
