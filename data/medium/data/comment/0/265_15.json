Well well well. As we all know, there\u2019s nothing that works sportswriters into a froth quite as much as, um, a piece about sportswriters. So it was entirely unsurprising when Bryan Curtis\u2019 latest feature at The Ringer was the talk of the business for much of Thursday. Curtis\u2019 attempt to get to the bottom of sportswriting\u2019s move to the left was the latest in a series of pieces that have gone down this particular rabbit hole. In November of last year, he dove into the question of how sports radio would evolve in the age of Trump, and in January, he questioned whether \u2018Stick To Sports\u2019 was dead and buried forever in the wake of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Clearly, the political tendencies of sports media are of interest to Curtis, and he\u2019s far from alone in this regard. The \u2018culture wars\u2019 have come to manifest themselves in every aspect of our society. Why should sports be any different? And there\u2019s undoubtedly a lot of interesting material to unpack here. There\u2019s the continued segmentation of our media into different, self-selecting echo chambers. There\u2019s the role of social media in spurring it all along. There\u2019s the changing power structure, and perception, of owners and players, management and labor. There\u2019s athlete activism, NCAA exploitation, and an actual communist in the press box! But there were also a few things missing from the narrative, and it\u2019s worth taking the time to point those out too. We can start by listening to the brilliant Shireen Ahmed, who took issue with the fact that certain voices were conspicuously absent from Curtis\u2019 piece.       There\u2019s really no question that Curtis\u2019 piece suffers from a lack of female, minority, LGBTQ, disabled voices. And to be clear, it\u2019s not simply out of some obligation to include as many diverse perspectives as possible, (although wouldn\u2019t that be nice), but it\u2019s also because, quite plainly, this is a major part of the story. Trying to figure out why sportswriting has taken a turn to the left? Well, it doesn\u2019t really take a sociology degree to figure out that it may have something to do with the fact that an occupation which has, historically, been almost exclusively the domain of white men, is finally starting to let others in, albeit far too slowly. Now that women, people of color, the disabled, don\u2019t have to wait around for a (almost certainly) white male newspaper editor to give them their shot, but can instead build their own outlet, and create their own opportunity, all of these new voices are, unsurprisingly, forcing the whole of sports media to take a fresh look at some issues that should have been examined more critically a long time ago. Like, for example, it\u2019s possibly a little crazy to name a football team after a racial slur, perhaps our testosterone fueled sports culture isn\u2019t always welcoming to women, and maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s something wrong with a system where predominantly black young men provide artificially restricted labor so that predominantly white older men may make massive profits off it. Curtis discusses all of this, but it\u2019s impossible to tell the story of how we arrived at this new equilibrium without including the people, long marginalized, who have helped to change the conversation. Perhaps, in some sense, sportswriting hasn\u2019t undergone an ideological shift, as much as it\u2019s simply widened the tent, causing a reevaluation of some tenets that really didn\u2019t hold up to intellectual scrutiny to begin with. In retrospect, what\u2019s crazy isn\u2019t that sportswriting \u201cmoved left\u201d on these issues, what\u2019s crazy is that it took so damn long for people to arrive at some rather common sense conclusions.  Which brings us to another idea that didn\u2019t seem to get the consideration it deserved, in Curtis\u2019 piece. Namely, the fact that for all the discussion of how sportswriting has changed, there\u2019s very little about how the political ground itself has actually shifted, under all of us. Climate change as mythology is now a basic part of Republican orthodoxy. Even as assault weapons become more powerful and deadly, the party has drawn a clear line in the sand against even the most basic and neutered forms of gun control. Despite staggering levels of inequality, the modern GOP fights vehemently against minimum wage laws, and for right to work legislation that will continue the total devastation of union strength in this country. It is a party that takes aim at our health care system without any notion of how to replace it, and puts forward nonsensical budgets with little concern for the fact that the numbers simply don\u2019t add up. And over the course of the last election cycle, their standard bearer, the man chosen to represent the party most prominently, stated, at various points, that women should be punished for having an abortion, that there\u2019d be nothing wrong with a new nuclear arms race, and that an entire religion should be barred from entering this country. You simply can\u2019t, or at least, shouldn\u2019t, have a conversation about \u201csportswriting\u201d, or any other profession, moving in a more left-leaning direction without also grappling with the notion that American conservatism, since the days of Reagan, has moved hard to the right, often past the point of logic, reason, and empirical evidence. For Curtis and others wondering why sportswriters are criticizing this President with far more frequency, it may have something to do with the fact that he routinely utters the sort of ignorant, offensive nonsense that would have been immediately condemned by all of polite society as recently as a few years ago. To quote the great Charlie Pierce over at Esquire, the modern GOP \u201cate the monkey brains\u201d some time ago, and if sportswriters are speaking up with great frequency, it might not be because they\u2019ve all turned into Karl Marx, but because, as Stephen Colbert put it more than a decade ago, \u201cReality has a well-known liberal bias.\u201d  Finally, there\u2019s one last thing absent from Curtis\u2019 piece, and in this case, it\u2019s simply a matter of good old fashioned missing the thread. In the article\u2019s conclusion, while discussing what\u2019s \u201cgone haywire\u201d in this new world of sportswriting, Curtis posits that this new cadre of liberal sportswriters may have inadequately covered one of the biggest stories of the last few years. Take the reaction to the Ray Rice video in 2014. There was a hue and cry throughout sportswriting: Something ought to be done! (If there was any criticism, it came from the left: that replays of the elevator video were \u201cre-victimizing\u201d his then-fianc\u00e9e, Janay.) Unfortunately, many of the early columns didn\u2019t always say who ought to do something or what it should be. Roger Goodell used the groundswell of rage to suspend Rice indefinitely and increase his already-fearsome power over player discipline. Sorry, but, well, no. This simply isn\u2019t the case. A simple search of the \u201cRay Rice\u201d tag over at Deadspin brings up a incredibly impressive body of work, on all angles of the story, including the most nuanced and challenging aspects of it. Greg Howard wrote thoughtfully about how timing and public relations were as much a factor in how Rice was treated as the actions themselves. Puja Patel noted with great eloquence that it was time to treat Janay Rice as more than simply a character in her husband\u2019s narrative. Barry Petchesky tackled the emerging idea that even after serving his suspensions, Rice was in some sense being \u201cblackballed\u201d from the league. Oh, and that end result that Curtis notes? The idea that Goodell and the league used the Rice situation to consolidate the Commissioner\u2019s power over player discipline? Here\u2019s Tom Ley writing about that troubling notion in January of 2015.  Of course, it\u2019s obviously not just Deadspin that authored rigorous, nuanced work on even the most intellectually challenging aspects of the Ray Rice story. Back in 2014, Kavitha Davidson, then with Bloomberg View, wrote about the serious problems with the NFL\u2019s disciplinary process. Jane McManus wrote thoughtfully at ESPNW about her belief that Rice deserved another chance in the NFL, despite the seriousness of his actions. At Think Progress, Lindsay Gibbs did the important work of tracking whether the NFL had truly put their money where their mouth was when it came to fighting domestic violence. Sorry, but if Curtis believes that writers were \u201ctying themselves in knots\u201d trying to find \u201cthe proper, liberal response,\u201d well, I just didn\u2019t see it. I saw, instead, an incredible talented and brilliant group of progressive journalists delving into every corner of the Rice story. Is it challenging, at times, to balance important principles by standing against domestic violence, protecting Rice\u2019s individual rights, ensuring that the league does not trample over its players on disciplinary matters, and attempting to answer the ultimately impossible question of what\u2019s enough punishment for a horrifying act of abuse? Of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean that this new, more broad, more open, more diverse, and yeah, ok, I guess, maybe even more progressive group of sportswriters isn\u2019t up to the challenge. It goes without saying that stories will continue to come to the surface that make sportswriters, liberal and otherwise, question and even shift some of their previously held principles. That\u2019s not something to worry about. It\u2019s the definition of how we learn, and grow, and evolve. From where I\u2019m sitting, sportswriting has done plenty of that in the last few decades, and while there\u2019s undoubtedly far more work ahead, I have no problem whatsoever saying that changes in sports media aren\u2019t something to fear, or scratch our heads over. They\u2019re something we should celebrate.  ", "creatorid": "e076ac315f6c", "timestamp": 1487356209896, "child": "", "username": "AGoot18"}
