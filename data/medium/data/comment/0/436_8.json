Her comments state that Sessions\u2019 prepared remarks called all immigrants \u201cfilth\u201d even though he did not dleiver that statement in his actual speech. She lied. Sessions did not call immigrants in general by that term. He specifically referred to MS-13, a latino gang, as filth. A Washington Post journalist apologized to Sessions today for doing the same thing. The author, Carimah Townes, has done nothing short of lible the AG of the United States. She shoull be terminated. This is the kind of person we do not need in any capacity of journalism, even when an organization like this can\u2019t ever be considered to be a journalistic in nature.
