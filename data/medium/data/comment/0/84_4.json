I agree, it kind of sucks when the player you paid to see isn\u2019t playing (I got tickets to see the Celtics-76ers game recently because I wanted to see Joel Embiid\u200a\u2014\u200adidn\u2019t work out when he got injured). I looked into getting Cavs tickets because I want to see him play live before he retires, but they were pretty expensive. Still, if I had bought them, and he didn\u2019t play, I would have been disappointed but gotten over it. For the most part, teams have gotten smart about rest and fans, in my opinion, should just deal with getting the short end of the stick occasionally.
