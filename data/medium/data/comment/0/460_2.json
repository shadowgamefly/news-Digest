Neither Ivanka nor Jared has qualifications anywhere close to what is needed to be a presidential advisor of any kind. And Eric and Donald Jr. wouldn\u2019t be running a business empire if not for their dad (and don\u2019t forget, Donald Sr. got his start through his dad). At least when JFK appointed RFK to be Attorney General, the latter had some law qualifications for the job. But that created such a stir that it served as the catalyst for the nepotism laws that followed. Just one nitpicky point. You say, \u201cIvanka thinks it\u2019s fine if the taxpayers who pay her salary\u2026\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aand Ivanka isn\u2019t getting a salary. However, I bet she gets a staff or at least an assistant (in addition to her West Wing office), and the taxpayers no doubt pay for those.
