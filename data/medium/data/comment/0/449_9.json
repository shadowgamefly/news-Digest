I am not surprised by the overlap. Urdu was a language born out of a concoction of multiple influences\u200a\u2014\u200aPersian, Hindi and Sanskrit being the predominant ones, but also several others. There is a possibility that Hebrew influences had also crept in unnoticed, or perhaps our languages share their roots to a much larger extent that we can even imagine! It is such a beautiful, humbling thought!\u00a0:) Gair rhymes with Hair with a soft \u2018i\u2019 and a dominant, rolled \u2018r\u2019.\u00a0:) I loved the commandment you shared. It resonated beautifully with the thought behind this piece and was also a reminder of how Universal all these wisdoms actually are! Thank you!\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "ac36709b5b55", "timestamp": 1491750293820, "child": "", "username": "runjhunnoopur"}
