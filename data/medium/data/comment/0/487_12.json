It\u2019s unfair that people assume they understand your situation, or the reason why you chose a childfree lifestyle. I agree that it\u2019s extremely irritating to have someone assume they have a right to your private information. Especially if they think they know you better than yourself! It\u2019s admirable that you plan on taking that care and love, and giving it children who may have not received it otherwise. A positive influence, no matter the size, has the possibility of having a great impact on someone of any age. I feel that especially applies to children.
