This is nothing new, I have had friends fired from jobs for the dishonesty of reporters and I have been misquoted by business journals to sound more brash or confrontational. Put another way, I would NEVER meet with a reporter without another person present and I would also record every second of the encounter. Trouble is their bosses will usually do nothing to right the situation if it helps sell their product. I learned this the hard way as a plant manager when dealing with unions, we got to the point where no manager would EVER meet with multiple union members without another manager present or it became a game of liars poker. This is where we are with journalism. Sadly journalists in today\u2019s world do not vet their stories very well, there is no such thing as off the record, and they have an agenda vs having objectivity. Now tell me why I would meet with a reporter over dinner. ", "creatorid": "6f9a95922f39", "timestamp": 1491821586527, "child": "", "username": "Greyguy"}
