I bought a book yesterday called Focus by Daniel Goleman and today, I found your article on my inbox. This is beyond words. Meanwhile, one of my best friends has sent me this: https://youtu.be/G8W3hqNi5yY and I hope this video and the book can be a life changer for many. To be honest, I\u2019m reading a book called The 80/20 Manager by Richard Koch https://www.amazon.com/80-20-Manager-Working-Achieving/dp/031624306X and I\u2019m planning once I finish it, I\u2019ll start reading Focus because that\u2019s exactly what I need in my life at the moment. I need to focus. Many thanks for this article! ", "creatorid": "2f83573938d7", "timestamp": 1491710302298, "child": "", "username": "irqlinux"}
