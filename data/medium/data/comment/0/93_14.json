I live in Central Florida and listen to the sports news daily. I heard yesterday the Magic fired GM Rob Hennigan and it was long overdue. He had 5 years to put at least a playoff team together and failed. OK I get that\u2026the part that confused me? The owner went on to say how great the scouting department is and that the Chief Head Scout (can\u2019t remember his name) who has done an excellent job would take over as temporary GM. Huh? You haven\u2019t made a playoff run in 5 years and you are telling the basketball world including all the other GM\u2019s in the league you have an excellent scouting staff? really? If that\u2019s the case, then either all the players that this scout raved about and Hennigan signed were that bad or Hennigan scoffed at all the players this scout recommended?..which one is it? because if I had a Chief scout that has been with me for 5 years along with GM and Ast, GM who just got fired\u00a0.I certainly would have to take a long serious look at all the scouts. I cannot imagine that an owner who is tired of losing would keep this scouting staff and fire both GM\u2019s. Something isn\u2019t right here Mr. Owner ", "creatorid": "54d8e122901c", "timestamp": 1492266842983, "child": "", "username": "johnhawley_56781"}
