I have been recently working with hybrid applications and this is the top most things that worries us, what will happen if we put some actions as sliding actions. Will a user know that? What if he doesn\u2019t? Most of the things you explained are quite handy but there is a concept where you hide actions on the slide of an item. How do you communicate those stuff to your user? For an iOS user it\u2019s common since users are used to the sliding actions in all applications but same is not valid for Android users.
