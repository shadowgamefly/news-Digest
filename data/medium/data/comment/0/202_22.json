For someone who calls themself a \u201cprofessional\u201d writer, and apparently is extremely focused on the structure, spelling, and grammar of a post, you seem not to be able to follow your own advice. After intense study, two books, a journalism position in print media, and a variety of other published material, I\u2019ve learned that the worst thing to do is to take advice about how to write. If you don\u2019t have that special touch, then you most likely will never have it, and it\u2019s something that cannot be learned. To be successful, you have to have a certain amount of luck, already established in some other way, or connected with people or places that will promote you. If this post \u201cspoke\u201d to you, then you probably shouldn\u2019t expect to be successful. ", "creatorid": "b52edc9b4b7e", "timestamp": 1491577675653, "child": "", "username": "theCaseyRoberts"}
