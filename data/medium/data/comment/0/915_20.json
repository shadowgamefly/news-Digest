However I also get dozens of email offers of companies selling \u201cWe will make you great!\u201d 6 figure income in 60 days BS\u2026. Yeah, at 59 years old I have heard that sales pitch since 8 years old when I tried selling door to door for Watkins Spices\u2026 what a joke. The other day I got a sales pitch and just decided that since that email \u201cperson\u201d asked \u201cWhat is holding your sales & company growth back?\u201d I decided to respond. I stated quite frankly, \u201cI am a \u201cWHISTLE BLOWER\u201d A PERSON WHO FINDS & FIGHTS CORRUPTION. USA media makes us the bad guys so no one want to hire a \u201cWhistle Blower\u201d as they might turn on your bad behavior. That person responded back, \u201cWell, I understand your position and obviously you are AFRAID TO TRY AND BUILD YOUR BUSINESS. Please contact us should you ever change your mind and decide you can build your business into something you dream of.\u201d Wopp, insulting a truthful person & using insult to gain a sale! The title of sales & the lack of understanding what th4e client is or about was obvious. They just read a script and don\u2019t think about what they say. I don\u2019t know how many jobs where I have seen such behavior, but one of the best examples of \u201cHaving a Job Title with no clue of what it meant to the company was the newspaper publisher I worked 9 years for. The friend of the publisher was given the \u201cTITLE\u201d of IT Tech & the pay increase to match it. However everyone in the company called me for the advice and rescue of the company computers, the maintaining of the network & training of computer use. At one point the entire main office MAC system get a virus and it shut most everything down. The next day was the \u201cbig production\u201d day, so I went home got my equipment of my home business, and after doing my work as Photo Editor for the day, about 5pm I walked around telling every to \u201cPUT EVERY DISK they had on the TOP OF THEIR DESKS\u2026 I then as everyone when home disconnected units, disinfected them, then put that computer to work disinfecting disks. 6:30am I had finished the entire computer network, picked up my gear and when home to get some sleep before needing to come back to do Photo Editing. Yep, you guessed it, a couple hours later I get a call telling me I did not do it right everything was infected and shutting down. So I grabbed my stuff and ran back. As I checked the systems, I walked in to the \u201cIT TECH person\u2019s office and sitting on his desk as a COUPLE OF GAMES DISKS\u201d! Knowing I had not seen them in the \u201cdisinfection of last night\u201d I challenged him and he admitted he did not want me to know he played games every morning during his warm up coffee, so had not put them out. He walks in a 7 am, and had reinfected the system in just 2 hours! I did the work, he had the title & paycheck. And nope he never got in trouble either\u2026 he got shamed by the employees, the Upper Management never cared. I had the system running quickly enough to save the day for them. I\u2019ll stick to my one person businesses\u2026 I screw up my fault, my fix\u2026 ", "creatorid": "fa4567bae4d2", "timestamp": 1491668265756, "child": "", "username": "petervanderhoof"}
