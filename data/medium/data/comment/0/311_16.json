She just didn\u2019t like you. We\u2019re in agreement.I have let people who I hated and wanted to see fail copy from my notes. So if the girl from your Geology class declined the same request, she would probably suffocate you by putting a plastic bag over your head if she thought she could get it away with it. Trying to talk to her after that was like asking to get pepper sprayed.No one hangs out at lectures.A girl is almost never going to call you. Be grateful her friends weren\u2019t drunk and didn\u2019t kill you. Your friend Dan wants bad things to happen to you.The Facebook story was just stalking, pure and simple.
