By all means, allow companies to invest their time and energy into R&D solar energy but it shouldn\u2019t need those massive state/federal subsidies if we want to look at it as a viable energy source. BTW, wind is a wonderful energy source that doesn\u2019t need subsidies to compete and even natural gas is very efficient, low cost and has very little pollution. Solar needs to be able to stand on its own against those two energy solutions. ", "creatorid": "683a9a5b98e9", "timestamp": 1492101644032, "child": "", "username": "Mithrandir48"}
