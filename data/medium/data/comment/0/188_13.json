The person hiring you isn\u2019t always your manager or the owner. It\u2019s someone in HR whose job it is to keep the conveyor belt full of workers. If someone leaves the conveyor belt (fired, retired, or hired by someone else) then they really just want someone who is \u2018good enough\u2019 to replace you. They don\u2019t actually care if you\u2019re going to do your very best, amazing work, just as long as you don\u2019t annoy anyone, stuff up really bad or break the law. If you\u2019re super talented and do amazing work they will hire you. If that person isn\u2019t available, they\u2019ll hire the next best person that they can get. If you\u2019re competing with someone else who is highly talented for a job, then that is good for the company hiring you, but only they ultimately benefit from the competition to be better than other applicants. They\u2019ll always just take the best that they can get, and that\u2019s good enough. ", "creatorid": "e8d65fd93e73", "timestamp": 1458463125589, "child": "", "username": "blairrorani"}
