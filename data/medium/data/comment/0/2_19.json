The ADA was actually written to make it illegal to request \u201cproof\u201d of disability. (In some circumstances where animals would not normally be allowed, proof of an animal\u2019s service status can be requested.) I could carry a doctor\u2019s note with me for when a security guard or doorman tries to tell me I can\u2019t ride my Segway in their building. But I don\u2019t, because I find the idea of being asked to \u201cshow my papers\u201d repugnant. I do have some tricks, though, especially since I have what\u2019s often called a \u201chidden disability\u201d because I usually show no outward signs (unless I have pinkeye or visible psoriasis, which are two possible symptoms of my condition that don\u2019t say \u2018trouble walking\u2019 to most people). If my hands are bothering me, I\u2019ll wear splints with the splinty bits removed just so it looks like I\u2019m wearing splints; that way, people don\u2019t try to shake my hand which could be painful or injure me. And I usually carry the cane when I\u2019m on the Segway even if my symptoms on that particular day would let me get along without it [the cane, not the Segway], because the cane serves as a signifier that I\u2019m using it as a mobility device and not as a toy. The point is, we agree that laymen shouldn\u2019t be routinely making judgments about what constitutes a disability. We just disagree on how that dilemma should be resolved.
