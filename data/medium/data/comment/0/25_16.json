Look up the all-time leaders in this category and you\u2019ll see almost nothing but hall of famers or future hall of famers. Now look up true shooting percentage for this season (which apparently isn\u2019t an arbitrary stat for some reason) and you\u2019ll see Tyson Chandler and some dude named Lucas Nogueira in the top two spots. No one could tell you who won the MVP the last time Big O averaged a triple double, but over 50 years later his season hasn\u2019t been forgotten.
