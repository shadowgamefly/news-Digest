Take the example of the green card holders. The article says, \u201csay, let\u2019s make the explicit decision to block green card holders\u201d but what does it link to? A CNN article where the reporter heard unofficially (his step in the game) that green card holders would be allowed in on a case by case basis. The game of telephone went from \u201callowed in\u201d to \u201cblocked\u201d The rest of the article smacks of that as well and STILL has to ask us to ignore the simple, innocent explanation, to assume the over the top conspiracy mongering one. It\u2019s more a work of speculative fiction than anything contributing to our understanding of current events.
