In this context the mass belief is that any corporation that isn\u2019t maximizing profits in the short run is unethical because the corporation is hurting stakeholders. This glaring idea frequently stated and frequently reinforced makes it easy to ignore the problems with profit by any means. In particular the concept of stealing becomes acceptable and even desirable if done by successfully lobbying for laws that provide avenues for corporate theft. There are then types of theft that are legal, and the emphasis on profit overshadows the fact that they are still immoral. At this point someone might claim that it\u2019s naive to call something immoral if it doesn\u2019t harm anyone. But when light is shined on the processes behind unproductive and destructive entrepreneurship, we see that harm is being done to individuals, small businesses, innovation and the general economy. There have been many article written in recent years attempting to explain the dropping growth rates of GDP as something now inevitable. I have viewed these apologists for what amounts to continuous failure as confused. The potential for innovation in all areas and at all levels only drops if either the incentives become weaker or if activities that crowd out innovation become institutionalized. It seems that both are now happening but that the latter may be the more important of the two. Now and then Congress does come up with a law meant to address some of the more extreme cases of legal theft, but without a general guide, which might be a greater focus on democracy, the core problems will persist.
