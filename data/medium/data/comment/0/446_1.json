First, what makes Rep. Franks think that border agents have no problem with bales of marijuana coming into the country? Second, if the bales of marijuana are managing to get smuggled in, what makes him think that a nuke couldn\u2019t get in the same way? Why bother hiding it in a bale of marijuana? Third, if a terrorist was truly bent on smuggling a nuke into the country, why would he attempt to do it over the Mexican border, which is the most heavily guarded? Why wouldn\u2019t he come in by boat somewhere along the coastline, or come across the mostly unguarded Canadian border? Or better yet, hide it in a cargo container landing in one of our ports, as it\u2019s been demonstrated that those aren\u2019t checked all that thoroughly? I would suggest that if marijuana was the only way to smuggle a nuke into the country, the best thing to do is remove the demand for Mexican marijuana (or foreign marijuana at all). And the way to do that is to legalize it here, tax it, regulate it, and watch domestic marijuana squelch the demand for it from other countries.
