Basically people want to be entertained not informed. Fantasy trumps reality any day. Emotion trumps insight. The great Dutch philosopher Spinoza is said to have sold a single copy of his masterwork in his own lifetime. Yet his writing went on to turn the world upside down as it was highly instrumental in breaking the church\u2019s suffocating grip on scientific thinking.
