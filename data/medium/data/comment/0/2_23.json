I\u2019m curious as to what happens; particularly if United even makes an effort to make good in some way. I was considering United for a trip from Montreal to Minneapolis, but given that Herself also has mobility issues, I\u2019m glad I chose to go with a different airline. UA just seems to be doing it WRONG this whole week (Doctor BEATEN onboard UA flight by airport police for not getting off\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was boarded, not denied boarding, and a Calgary man bitten by a scorpion on a UA flight). My heartfelt sympathies for what you went through. I hope you are seriously considering legal action against UA. From the sounds of things, you have documents, names, dates and times as well as UA\u2019s own luggage regs on your side.
