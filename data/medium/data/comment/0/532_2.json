My general test of whether or not something is ok to say is if we switched it around would it be offensive to people? If so then you should find a way to articulate yourself better. The person who made the remark about the white male card game did so for a reason and got called on it. Btw those that disrupt traffic and the lives of other people SHOULD face stiffer penalties. Freedom of speech does not trump other people\u2019s rights to go to work, make a trip to the hospital, etc\u2026 To argue otherwise is something THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED. Those who were ignoring it weren\u2019t being a bunch of racist white guys and trying to make that implication was wrong.
