Also noticed a bit of text blurring during the animation, believe its related to the centering css on the main app div causing issues with the font aliasing, particularly when it lands on sub-pixel destination coordinates (in latest Mac Chrome). If you remove the transform the text stays consistent but in a fixed position. Played around a bit with some css approaches to adjust the centering animation to account for text and found that changing the transform from 2d to 3d and setting the backface to hidden produced the most consistent result.
