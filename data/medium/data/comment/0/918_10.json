We brush off compliments and downplay achievements. I agree with this 100%! At first, it seems awkward and unnatural but if you can own what you see in the mirror, take that attitude and share it at work, you\u2019ll get the recognition.

Men are great at it, time for women to jump on that confidence train! ", "creatorid": "590afb06c8a4", "timestamp": 1491837092225, "child": "", "username": "mialockhart"}
