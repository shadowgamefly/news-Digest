For example, what if copy and paste in Facebook automatically added a \u201csource: \u201c link? What if the Web Annotations work currently being explored at W3C takes off, and we have a way for people to add a source? I don\u2019t think \u201ctruth value by majority\u201d is the answer. But unsourced maps, meme images, quotes, are for sure a problem. We can\u2019t force people to address it, but the technology can encourage people.
