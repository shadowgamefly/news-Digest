Not all 67-win teams are created equal. Only one other team of the 12 has had two former MVPs: the 86 Celtics, featuring prime Larry Legend and Bill Walton, who was closer to Christopher Reeve than he was to Superman at that point. Conversely, the Dubs have two of the top three players in the league. Both are former MVPs and both are still in their prime. The \u201cwins\u201d argument (which is the \u201cbest player on the best team\u201d argument in disguise), is only a viable argument when the best player on the best team is irrefutable. That isn\u2019t the case for the Dubs this season. ", "creatorid": "1f30e8ddedde", "timestamp": 1492103522191, "child": "", "username": "billyrivi"}
