I disagree with your disagree\u00a0:) I\u2019m not making a case for overdoing anything, I\u2019m making a case for not using linear motion. Additionally, I\u2019m also not fully understanding your use of the phrase \u2018repetitive easing.\u2019 All objects should ease, and that ease should be fairly standard across the UX. This meets the definition of repetitive. To vary the easing would be inconsistent. Additionally, calling attention to itself is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it is effective and supports usability. Elastic motion \u2018calls attention\u2019 to itself in that it is noticed, and can be extremely effective while supporting usability.
