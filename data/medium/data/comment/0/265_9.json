By opposing the ridiculous notion that gender is a social construct rather than a matter of biology and that men should be allowed use the same bathrooms as our daughters, Schilling was shown the door by ESPN. It\u2019s no coincidence that ESPN is losing around 10,000 subscribers a day and is becoming a drain on Disney profits at the same time it has shifted to promoting SJW (Social Justice Warrior) politics that are anethema to many sports fans. By celebrating the likes of Colin Kaepernick and the transgender bathroom issue, sports media seems intent on sucking the joy and fellowship many fans feel when watching and talking about sports, turning it into just another political arena that further divides the country. And now the NFL foolishly wants to wade into this maelstrom by demainding that the state af Texas kowtow to this left wing groupthink on transgender bathrooms. That won\u2019t end well for the league. The credibility of the mainstream media in much of the country has collapsed over the past decade and now sports media seems hellbent on following them down that same destructive path. Somewhere along the line liberals have morphed into the new McCarthyites\u2026Are you now or have you ever been a Conservative? Any evidence of deviating from leftist orthodoxy are met with attempts to shout down or shame these heretics into silence. The smug condescension of Bryan Curtis is representative of the problems with modern day sports writing. Bill Simmons rose to fame by being the voice of the everyman, the type of guy you\u2019d love to talk sports with over beers in a bar. He now seems intent on squandering this capital by turning The Ringer into a sports oriented version of Slate with absolutely no diversity of opinion that might appeal to the rest of the country outside of the coastal redoubts that represent the ever shrinking geography of the Democratic party. The Ringer will have a very short shelf life if it continues to fail to fairly represent the viewpoints of a large portion of the country. If that turns out to be the case then good riddance.
