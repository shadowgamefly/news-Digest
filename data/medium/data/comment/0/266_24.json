I find something interesting about you saying at the end that there\u2019s 53.9% of America that didn\u2019t vote for Trump to draw from as an audience, and of course that\u2019s true. It does seem a bit disingenuous to say \u201cfuck the 46.1% who did; I won\u2019t even write a neutral piece to try to draw them in\u201d. It\u2019s fascinating to watch, really: people preaching against intolerance (which is definitely happening, sure), but using intolerance of their own sort to do so. Would it make sense to say \u201cfuck the 48.1% of readers who are women, I can draw from the 51.9% who are men\u201d? (Or vice versa.) of course not, that\u2019d be absurd.
