That\u2019s something that is easily openable for free. Many online banks offer 1% standard, and if you dig around you can find ones that offer 1.05% and even 1.10% APY. You just have to spend a little bit of time looking for them. But the bottom line is those products are free and anyone still using Digit after their 100 days are over is going to be giving their hard earned money away for no reason. I liked Digit too, for the reasons stated in the original post, but it\u2019s not worth $2.99 per month for that. I will happily pay it if they add value, such as automated investment advising, etc.. but not a chance that it\u2019s worth it for their existing service.
