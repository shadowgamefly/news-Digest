But when these sites were uncovered, Trump and his minions, as usual, not only lied and denied, they tried to change the narrative and claim that the real, mainstream media, was fake news. Then, his cult-like followers would have to turn to him or Fox or Breitbart for information (if one can really call that info). And Presto!! You have an unthinking right-wing follower, as described in John Dean\u2019s classic book,Conservatives Without a Conscience.
