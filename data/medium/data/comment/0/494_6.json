I used to have to call, but you would wait on hold forever and the bored person you talked to was never very helpful. Now I just take a picture and send it along. I have seen problems get fixed right away because my alderman and other local politicians are following along. I would recommend SeeClickFix to anyone who is interested in helping to get problems in their communities noticed and acted upon.
