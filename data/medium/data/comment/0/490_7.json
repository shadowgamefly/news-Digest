One question though, and I may have read this wrong, but you mention how there are worse fates than dying in water, but from the last line \u201cJust the tsunami and you/And whether you will swim or not\u201d to me, implies that after all is said and done after the divides have been taken down what matters is whether one can swim; so in a way, drowning is incredibly important and may very well be the worse of fates because it dictates whether or not we survive. It\u2019s our judgment, not from someone else but a judgement we give ourselves because to drown means we never learned something we could have easily taught ourselves. I could be taking this in a different direction than intended, so all of this with a grain of sea salt.
