It\u2019s that the people who vote for NBA awards are addicted to their \u201cnarratives\u201d and they ignore defense. Duncan and Garnett were far better players than any of the winners in this period, which is why they won three of the four championships. Duncan didn\u2019t even win DPOY during this period (or ever, for that matter), which is criminally negligent. (Also, as if to illustrate my point: The Pistons were not, in fact, the defending champions in 2006. The Spurs were. And 2008 Garnett only had a \u201cnice\u201d season if you ignore his defense and focus excessively on box score numbers.)
