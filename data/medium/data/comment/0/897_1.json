I never wanted to fit in, but I\u2019ve never been in actual danger because of my weirdness. As for getting help, I think I\u2019ve got too much going on right now. While I was in therapy for other stuff I mentioned gender dysphoria, but it was not the focus. I had more troubling stuff going on. I also don\u2019t know how much this stuff can be helped, but that might just be my ingrained dislike of asking for help\u2026 Thanks for taking an interest, talking to you was nice\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "608e6abc784", "timestamp": 1489487412101, "child": "", "username": "Cala"}
