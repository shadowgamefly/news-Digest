They are also a communication tool, from the strategic level down to the individuals and teams. What do I mean? Sometimes the real deadlines are too far out, and impossible to measure. At some point competitors will overtake you. At some point your legacy system will become unmaintainable. At some point lack of success will dry up your investment sources. It\u2019s impossible for you to decide what to do and how to work on the basis of such amorphous and distant deadlines. All the great points you make in \u201cWhy deadlines work\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200anobody behaves that way because of something that\u2019s still two years off, or probably two years off, it\u2019s simply beyond our event horizon. So you need to set yourself arbitrary deadlines along the road, not just to practice delivering at speed, but to avoid sleepwalking your way (with engineering excellence!) through two years and waking up to discover that the world moved on without you.
