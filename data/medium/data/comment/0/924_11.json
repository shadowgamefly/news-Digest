Right now the way we see a lot of people answering questions like that at the founding stage is just connecting Mode Analytics directly to a production read replica. That obviously isn\u2019t a solution that is particularly capable, but for many folks we find it falls into the \u201cgood enough\u201d bucket at this stage. Later, those same queries written on that replica will work pretty similarly (potentially identically if its Postgres) once someone moves that data into Redshift via a tool like Stitch, so it\u2019s actually not a complete dead-end.
