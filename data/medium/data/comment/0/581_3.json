I\u2019m the person who\u2019s been recruiting authors to write these\u200a\u2014\u200aand what I want to reinforce with each post is that there\u2019s a bigger picture to these articles as a collection. Individually\u200a\u2014\u200aeach article can\u2019t help but focus on a single topic. Anything more, and we\u2019d have to write a book. But as a collection, I want to start killing the idea of the magic silver bullet in personal development. We know high achievement is possible. We also know that the majority of that achievement comes from the paired combination of smart training and hard work. That path is both very hard and really, not hard at all. Quit futzing around with get-rich-quick schemes and start doing the actual work that works. The only truthful way to look at doing the work is that success requires multiple levels. For example, a runner will train speed, endurance and flexibility separately. Similarly, your goal might be to be an entrepreneur. You will have to train skills product design and marketing. Where does today\u2019s article fit? I\u2019d call this layer: capacity. Grit is about your capacity to do the work even when the work is hard. The way to use this article is to pair it with the work you\u2019re already doing. Work on your grit and also keep working on your diet, your exercise, your secret project.
