This disconnect fails to support loving one another, focusing instead on Wink\u2019s view of \u201cviolence\u00a0\u2026 as the nature of things,\u201d of humanity as inherently violent. Granted, humanity\u2019s first barrier to personal change is the inhibiting notion that we are animals by nature, unsuited to change. Such \u201cme first\u201d attitude governs human adolescence until we are deconstructed by circumstances and \u201creborn\u201d into a spiritual consciousness of new life. This human maturation process abides in love as we begin to see ourself as part of a larger reality that includes all of humanity. The Indian sage Sri Aurobindo states this clearly: \u201cWe are consciousness, not life and form.\u201d \u201cIf a god is what you turn to when all else fails, violence certainly functions as a god.\u201d Where is the \u201credemption\u201d in violence? This is an intellectual detour at best, and an apologia for state sponsored terrorism at worst. Love abides within the shade of the tree of god, and violence finds no footholds there.
