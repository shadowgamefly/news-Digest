Here\u2019s one of the mystery player stat lines for the 16/17 season you love so much Bill: Player A: 44/35/85% Player B: 43/34/85% Not that much of a difference right? Player A is Harden, Player B is Westbrook. If he\u2019s so much more efficient why aren\u2019t his percentages much higher that Westbrook\u2019s? Much like you threw out Westbrook\u2019s extra two rebounds on your podcast, I\u2019m throwing out Harden\u2019s better efficiency. Then it comes down to an argument you already made yourself, that we will definitely remember this as the Westbrook season. So many more iconic games and shots from Westbrook, without even mentioning his cold-blooded, relentless revenge tour. 2016\u20132017 MVP has got to belong to who the season belonged to: Russell Westbrook.
