One very common example of a static type systems that do have a non-performance runtime component is C#, whose support for dynamic via the DLR and reified generics allow the runtime\u2019s semantics to depend on the type system. Moreover, many more statically typed languages have type systems that can provide performance benefits, even if they have no runtime component.
