Or are you actually saying what should be said\u2026..stop bitching about what other people get that you don\u2019t and go get it yourself. I, for one am sick of the term \u2018white privilege\u2019 I am a white man of 60 who doesn\u2019t feel \u2018privileged\u2019 in the slightest. After forty years of employment, I spent three years out of work, one of those unable to work because of a broken arm. What did my \u2018white privilege\u2019 get me? Nothing. I got no benefits of any kind. I won\u2019t state the reason I was given because you wouldn\u2019t believe it. I now live from day to day. I have never intentionally or consciously put anyone down because of their race, colour or creed nor indeed their sexuality yet \u2018white man\u2019 is demonised the world over. Why? because we dare to ask for more? I\u2019m reminded of the words of an actor \u2018of colour\u2019 who once said: \u2018Don\u2019t get bitter, get better\u2019 I\u2019ve spent most of my life living by that even though it\u2019s got me practically nowhere. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who suffers because of his skin colour but believe me, being white doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. Good luck with your life.
