An important thing to note, is that most people are both initiators and bare minimum people in different aspects of their lives. Yes, there are some people who go above and beyond in everything they do. And there are some people who will never bother with more than the minimum level of expectation. But for most of us, we have areas where we are going to drive and intiate and areas where we are going to need a lot of direction. The key for managers is to understand what motivates our people to be their best, most aggressive selves, and frame work to harness that. The key for us as individuals is enough honest self-reflection to understand what will motivate us and excite us enough to dig deep and initiate. And then to try and align those motivations with our goals. ", "creatorid": "f421005e2af3", "timestamp": 1491229155454, "child": "", "username": "scunningham.gt"}
