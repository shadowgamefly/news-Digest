Now that I have children, one part of that interview boils my blood. Interviewer: \u201cWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\u201d Me: \u201cWell, actually I enjoy designing stuff.\u201d Interviewer: \u201cThat\u2019s good, because the last candidate we interviewed said he just liked to play with his kids. We prefer someone who actually reads or thinks about design in his spare time.\u201d Are you kidding me? I didn\u2019t realize it then, but now that I look back, I see the egregiousness of that question. What I do in my spare time is my own business.
