Trellis serves SMBs, freelancers, small teams and open source much better. As a VP Sales and Marketing, I can see the logical growth for Atlassian by acquiring a complementary product that provides existing customers and revenue in a new sector of the market faster than building such. I think Atlassian bought Trello because of this. Not because Trello threatened their enterprise business, not at all. It fits perfectly with Atlassians vision for themselves in the larger market as it continues to mature as a company.
