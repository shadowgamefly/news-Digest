Most other countries in the West have \u2018public healthcare, education, transport, finance\u2019. The United States is saddled with the myth of \u2018freedom\u2019 and the belief that since some individuals have managed to rise above the adversity of humble beginnings, all people have this ability. The ones who don\u2019t succeed, therefore just haven\u2019t worked hard enough. Couple that with an education system that emphasises producing diplomas rather than thinkers, then come election day, you will end up with derisively unsuitable candidates like Clinton and Trump. Until those fundamental myths are demolished, U.S. society is likely to be further unequal and polarized.
