I understand all your concern about not having access to Pence during a meal where he might open up and such, or that provides timing efficiency. But why does the meal require that only two people be present. Pence has not said he refused to have an interview, or an interview over a meal. It sounds to me like some sort of standard chaperone could be provide and all would work out well. What about the Secret Service for example? In fact has he or has he said he would have private one on one dining with male journalists? It might not even be sexists which is the immediate reaction of women. For all you who claim he cannot control his urges, I think the motivation is entirely different. He simply does not want a woman coming forward at a later date saying he drugged her food or alcohol, and claims something happened that comes down to a he said/she said argument that could be used for political pressure. Convince me such things never happen. ", "creatorid": "263cdc204caa", "timestamp": 1491692198989, "child": "", "username": "Schroedinger99"}
