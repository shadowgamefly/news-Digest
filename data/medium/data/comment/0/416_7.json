Professional deniers in high places will get away with sowing disinformation & confusion as long as doubt remains in the public mind about the scientific consensus and the hard evidence from all disciplines of the deep trouble we\u2019re facing. But climate scientists themselves, the bedrock authority and trusted source for climate information (http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/majorities-of-americans-trust-climate-scientists-family-and-friends/ don\u2019t have the public\u2019s ear except with small live audiences, through Web videos and the occasional TV appearance. Their knowledge is selectively filtered and misrepresented by mainstream press & TV as we know too well. Abundant online climate news & analysis, the explosion of social media focus, the efforts of thousands of organizations & activists\u2026 all are stymied by the mainstream media\u2019s discretion to simply ignore them, thus withholding progress. There is a reason presidential debates aren\u2019t held online. The broadcast network/ cable television arena is still center stage, still where issues and the people behind the issues are hauled before live cameras \u2013 still where public policy arguments are exposed & national opinion is shaped. You will not find scientists on that stage, and that should, and can be made to change. Lomborg, Lamar Smith, Trump, Breightbart, ALEC, Fox News\u2026 for responsible journalists it\u2019s wack-a-mole for each & all, over & over on a daily basis.
