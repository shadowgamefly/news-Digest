Three observations: First, as I see it the outrage media is selling an escapism much like drugs, which for all I know acts like drugs in the brain. Achieving profits here has come at the expense of facts, both in the moment and in causing a fraction of the population to believe non-facts. I have recently read credible accounts of \u201cDark Money\u201d on the right paying outrage media to support certain positions; I have recently read rumors of the Russian intelligence services causing related media to support other positions. This is called \u201cdisinformation\u201d, and has no place in the responsible media of a functioning democracy. Second, there is no one \u201cherding cats\u201d to coalesce the messages of the left, in the way the agents of the super rich (and to a lesser extent what\u2019s left of the Republican establishment) do on the right. Bernie had a clear message, but it was the far-left message of a minority party, not the center-left message of a governing party. The left needs those cats herded, which means think tank and PR money and at least some consensus being driven. Lastly, critical thinking skill is essential, in every voter in a functioning democracy. Something\u2019s gone wrong on that front, that so many voters have been led to take positions and vote for candidates whose policies severely damage those voters\u2019 well being. (Oh, and for those tempted to dismiss me as of the left: I was a lifelong card carrying Republican, as was my father before me who was a low level political appointee in the later years of the Reagan administration, until my Party lost its way and decided that being a moderate made me a RINO.)
