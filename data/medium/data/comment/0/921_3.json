With respect to the massive amounts of data and need to input-process-analyze-output in many real-time scenarios (i.e., autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructures), it seems more advanced AI systems are needed in order to maintain lower latencies and respond to chaotic/hostile environments where narrow intelligence is facing challenges. DARPA\u2019s recently announced L2M program hints at the next wave of AI based on Biologic Intelligence. Defintely a space that\u2019s rapidly changing with the maturing intersection of science and technology. Thanks again for the read. \u2013 J.
