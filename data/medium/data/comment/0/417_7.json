Because America has by far the most powerful military in the world, the other nation states will never firmly stand up against this upcoming new criminal US administration of Trump and main surrogates that are defiantly and dangerously denying climate change. Inside the US, we can fear that public institutions and private organizations will be intimated and subdued by the upcoming federal executive branch of US government. Therefore, the only hope is that decent and responsible world citizens, from the US and the rest of the world, unite trough an international network to stop that nonsense. I put forward the following proposition on which I hope some solid international NGO or Network will follow through and make theirs. Gather some of the best lawyers, scientists and economists on Climate Change and start an international court case (This will obviously be a mock Tribunal at first, but having in mind that this is only be the first step of a process by which it will further morphed into a real UN accredited international Tribunal) whereby Trump and his main surrogates on the subject will be prosecuted (first in absentee, but later for real) for Crimes against Humanity for their defiant and criminal denying of human made climate change. The jurors being all the decent world citizens thereby registered that would cast their vote on the case.
