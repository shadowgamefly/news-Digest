Christians not having the influence we once had in the 1900s gives me great hope. For the past 100 years we\u2019ve had a lot of cultural converts. Everyone is a Christian because they grew up in Texas. Or they go to church. Or their mom and dad raised them that way. Hell, according to the U.S. census 70% of Americans identify as \u201cChristian.\u201d But the vast majority of those responses are nothing more than cultural identification, not Christianity. I imagine that\u2019s why so many people despise Christians. Their belief is cultural, and no one intends to follow the man they claim governs their life, so we end up this giant homogenous blob of hypocrites that judge and condemn people, instead of looking like they did in 165 AD. Instead of rushing to the aid of others, or paying for pagan burials like our ancestors did, we have half-hearted followers who run rampant through the streets of social media pointing the finger to everyone except themselves. This may as well be called the No True Christian fallacy. Who put you in charge of deciding who the real Christians are, exactly? The truth is religion is politics, and your politics and the politics of other Christians simply aren\u2019t the same. These differences are not new. They triggered the Reformation. They led to countless wars and a legacy of colonial terror across the globe. They lie beneath the thousands of contradicting translations of the Bible that span hundreds of languages. You may very well adhere more closely to one interpretation of one Bible, but that\u2019s also not relevant to what or who is Christian.
