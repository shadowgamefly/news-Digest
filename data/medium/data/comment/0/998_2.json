I haven\u2019t found anything that works really well for me to remind / prompt on stale contacts. Theoretically Contactually does this. I kicked the tires on it again recently. It\u2019s just too complicated for what I want as a single user. I am not currently actively selling, but I do have a very large contact database. And really that\u2019s what I want \u2013 a collection of facts about people & companies, with different ways to slice & dice & search. I\u2019m over on CapsuleCRM now, which has \u201cdata tags\u201d so you can create modified custom fields for different kind of contacts. So, if I tag a company with \u201cstartup\u201d I can include other fields like \u201clast raise\u201d, \u201cinvestors\u201d, \u201cAngelList link\u201d etc. Or tag someone as \u201cinvestor\u201d, and add a field of \u201cinvestment stage\u201d or \u201cinvestment interests\u201d. I have used Nimble a long time ago. It really does pull in every single communications channel. I seem to remember it having pretty good stale features, but it\u2019s been a while since I used it. Hope that helps. Let me know your experience! ", "creatorid": "94d93f03d336", "timestamp": 1485918054673, "child": "", "username": "bmann"}
