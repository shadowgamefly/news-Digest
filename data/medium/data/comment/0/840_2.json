Could you maybe give some details about how you optimised that? I\u2019m right now working on a project and I have used the new IntersectionObserver API (polyfilled) and it has worked very well in terms of performance. Did you maybe use the same approach? + huge kudos for proving that investing into PWA\u2019s makes sense from an engineering as well as a business standpoint. It\u2019s way easier for devs in smaller companies to justify taking the time to improve perf\u00a0:) Thanks\u00a0:)!
