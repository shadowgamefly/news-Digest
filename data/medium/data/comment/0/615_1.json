My roots are from an ultra conservative religious upbringing. I wrote an article about a simple approach to life that I learned from my father, that he taught through baseball. He was such a gifted as a coach. It relayed a story of my freshman daughter being bullied by senior girls in the dugout after a rough game of strikeouts. \u201cYou fucking suck, you have no right to be playing varsity.\u201d I recounted the experience accurately. The entire article was a tribute to my father. I sent it to my mom to read before I published it here. Her response was, \u201cI read it 4 times and cried, it was perfect! Just take out the F word, please!\u201d She explained that none of my siblings would read it and she wanted them to read it. It was a ridiculous request. We had a discussion just like the points you make in this article. In the end, I did not take it out. My mom copy and pasted it into a word doc, edited it to something like, \u201cYou aren\u2019t a good player\u201d and passed it around to all my siblings and her 30 grandkids. ALL words have different levels of power. Even though this is a poor example of your point, ALL words have their place. My mom said, \u201cit is so disgusting, God is not happy with people who use words like that, it\u2019s just a horrible word.\u201d And I said, yes mom, that is the point! It elicits emotion!! Fricken Fracken just doesn\u2019t ring the same bell. Thanks Jonas, fun read. ", "creatorid": "3a1cd7ce69ef", "timestamp": 1492182695986, "child": "", "username": "rowdyrog"}
