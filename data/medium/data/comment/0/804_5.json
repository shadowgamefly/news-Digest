What worries me are many claims in your article that are very subjective but stated as if they are facts (especially in the section \u201cWhy Custom Is Better\u201d). I don\u2019t even know where to start a response (or have the time to, frankly), but suggesting to write your own lexer/parser for each language you want to build in general is just no good advice. It\u2019s certainly good to get a better understanding of what is needed to have a functioning programming language, and some people might even consider it fun to re-invent the wheel over and over again, but in practice, there are many reasons to consider coco tools, or even better language workbenches like Xtext, Spoofax, MPS, Metaedit+, or others, especially if you need interoperability with other languages, rich editing, rich semantics, language testing, etc. ", "creatorid": "70df94186f22", "timestamp": 1491209203101, "child": "", "username": "digitalember"}
