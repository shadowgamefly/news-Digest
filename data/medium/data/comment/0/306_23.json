I\u2019ve been asked clarify the President\u2019s remarks about an Armada. Firstly, this is not showmanship. The showman\u2019s ship, his 282-foot Trump Princess yacht, was sold in 1991 for a YUGE profit and is not part of the Armada. I can assure you reports that the repossession,\u00a0\u2026 I mean his depression,\u00a0\u2026, he didn\u2019t even know Jeff Sessions,\u00a0\u2026 and the wrongful impression that it was part of a massive debt restructuring is fake news. Secondly, President Trump has had a tremendous impact on the yachting industry dating back to the late 1980s when he commissioned the world\u2019s largest yacht and bought a shipyard, which launched his many philanthropic activities. Two of his favorite charities, American businessman Peter Kutell and Saudi Prince Al-Waleed, were the beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s gifting of the Amels shipyard and Princess yacht respectively. These were gifts\u200a\u2014\u200anot sales made at a loss\u200a\u2014\u200aperiod! Lastly, let\u2019s break down the word arm-ada. I\u2019m not going to explain \u201carm\u2019 because I won\u2019t entertain the the media\u2019s false narrative about our President\u2019s small hands. Ada is a word to describe a sexy vixen who is hard to catch (check your urban dictionary). So let\u2019s just say armada is code for \u201cPOTUS is preparing to grab Korean Kim by the Jong-uns.\u201d ", "creatorid": "c93dbd2ed33e", "timestamp": 1492220836591, "child": "", "username": "harperthorpe"}
