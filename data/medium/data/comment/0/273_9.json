They establishing the talking points and all others must repeat them loyally or they are not considered part of the left. I applaud the NYT for their bravery to allow debate even if it is unbalanced with how they supply 100 to 1 against those parts of the debate they prefer to be the winner of the debate. The radical left believes they should be allowed to silence, even by force, those they do not agree with.
