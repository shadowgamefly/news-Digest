Also undocumented immigration is down by over 3.5 million since 1/09 when Pres. Obama came into office. He deported more than a million targeting mostly those with actual criminal background not minor offenses or DWI\u2019s. Another million and more left during the Bush Great Recession that brought down Wall St. and our economy. It was the rich, deregulated banksters NOT immigrants, unionists, welfare recipients, or hapless minority homeowners that took $16.7 TRILLION from Americans, took five+ million homes, took 10+ million jobs on top of the five million manufacturing jobs and 60,000 companies shipped overseas or to Mexico under Bush-Cheney. Hypocritically, the GOP have shipped jobs to Hispanics in Mexico than undocumented Hispanic immigrants have ever taken. Let us guess, Louis: no college, no military service, no service to God or country. ", "creatorid": "1172df96f278", "timestamp": 1491849079698, "child": "", "username": "thomashall_5941"}
