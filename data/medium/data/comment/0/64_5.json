One aspect that was not discussed was the angle where trade line acquisitions factor into the mix.

Both acquisitions give both teams substantially more different looks and more room for adjustment from game to game in each series. How each team decided to make those moves going into the playoffs is intriguing. Question is, were the moves done early enough to make a marked improvement in the playoffs? As the season wound down, I am not sure, but as each series moves forward I think the impact will be more pronounced.
