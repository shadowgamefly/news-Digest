I know more than a little about being called in to fix a problem. In my experience, people underestimate the business side of business as much as the expertise side of business. But my comment here is regarding this passage: \u201c You\u2019ll have to spend thousands of hours, unpaid hours, researching, learning, studying, practicing and adapting your skills in the real world. \u201cOnly that will give you the deep domain expertise you need to reach the top 1% of your field\u200a\u2014\u200aand that comes with great financial reward.\u201d If you are lucky enough to have the privilege of choosing your career (definitely not a given), choose something you love, not just something to pay the bills. You\u2019ll never make it through the thousands of unpaid hours to become an expert unless you have a passion to learn and become an expert, first and foremost, for yourself. And keep in mind there are lots of rewards that aren\u2019t directly monetary. Maybe you can work where you really like to live, or can work flexibly so you have time for family or sports or both or something else entirely.
