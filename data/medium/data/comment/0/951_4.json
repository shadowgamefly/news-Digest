The gist of what you wrote seems to be the same as a piece of advice I read in a classic book called The Practice of Programming, published in 1999 by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike: \u201cWrite a version of your program to throw away. You will, anyway.\u201d In the same context, the book also talked about the \u201czero draft\u201d: your initial stab at something, which is such a rough draft that it may not even deserve to be called the \u201cfirst draft.\u201d I would probably do well to follow this concept more in my own programming. Instead, I tend to try to write a complete, perfect program from the very start. Often I succeed in writing very good code that does not later need to be rewritten, except for minor tweaks. The disadvantage is that I take the risk of wasting a lot of time if my whole approach to solving the problem turns out not to be feasible.
