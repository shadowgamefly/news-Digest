He\u2019s top 10 in defensive win shares (only\u00a0.1 behind Kawhi Leonard and virtually tied wth DeAndre Jordan). He\u2019s #2 in Defensive Box Plus/Minus (4.7), behind only Draymond Green (4.9). His defensive rating is in the top 15. He has a slight edge in steals, while Harden has a slight edge in blocks. My vote goes to Westbrook.
