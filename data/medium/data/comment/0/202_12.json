I do not write to publish or to sell or to be read. I write for me\u200a\u2014\u200amostly. I say mostly because I have come to realize I do want people to read my words, people other than me. I have also come to realize that having a reader is my payment. Having a reader send a comment to my posts, my blogs, or comments is even more payment! Would I love to write a first-ever Great American Novel? Sure. But I am old and not willing to put that kind of effort into a project that will not produce such a document; the publishing business is not what it used to be, is it? So I write my blogs, my Medium posts, and hope someone reads. And I admire those who do it for a living.
