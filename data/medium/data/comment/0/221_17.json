Fear gets into our minds and seems to overpower every positive and rational thought sometimes\u00a0. Some people are so strong and can overcome with faith and mind over all other thoughts\u00a0. The subconscious mind is a very powerful and controlling part of our bodies\u00a0. These are excuses made of thick links of iron and it takes a strong faith and strength to overcome all of these adverse effects. Could you write something on how to best overcome your lazy\u00a0, frightening mind\u00a0? Thank you\u00a0! Nothing I can think of is helping me right now even though I am intelligent and I believe in the words you say\u00a0. I am so tired and my body just aches with pain because I never really relax when I finally sleep\u00a0.
