As someone who wakes up everyday to work to see more women in sales and sales leadership roles in companies that are traditionally male-majority on their sales teams\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m not interested in who\u2019s better because there is room for both great women and great men in sales. The issue for me is, \u201chow do we find better sellers\u200a\u2014\u200aregardless of who they are.\u201d What the stats don\u2019t show is what sorts of onboarding programs these reps who made the 32K calls participated in. With a number of companies involved, even if \u201csimilar\u201d the onboarding, training, and coaching will vary greatly. Even within a company with a good program, sometimes due to headcount (or lack of it) new reps can come on and \u201cjump in\u201d with little support. With that said, I can certainly tout the results of your research when I talk to young women who have not considered a sales career or who might be thinking of changing from one team within their company to sales. Even though the end result (more sales) is on the women\u2019s side for this study, it is not exhaustive and is not qualitative\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat it is though, is the first study of its kind that I have seen and should encourage more research into what makes reps great\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter who they are.
