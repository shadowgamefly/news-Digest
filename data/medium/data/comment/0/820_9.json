In Carlo Rovelli\u2019s \u201cSeven Brief Lessons on Physics\u201d, he discusses Einstein\u2019s work in advancing quantum theory, quoting one of his articles. Rovelli explains: These simple and clear lines are the real birth certificate of quantum theory. Note the wonderful initial \u201cIt seems to me\u2026\u201d, which recalls the \u201cI think\u2026\u201d with which Darwin introduces in his notebooks the great idea that species evolve, or the \u201chesitation\u201d spoken of by Faraday when introducing for the first time the revolutionary idea of magnetic fields. Genius hesitates. There is something infinitely reassuring to me in seeing that these titans of scientific achievement did not claim absolute certainty, or pass off their observations, ideas and opinions as universal truths. They stumbled upon something interesting, and presented that thing as work-in-progress, allowing for response and critique. Rather than looking to dictate, they were opening the floor for conversation. While we may not be on the bleeding edge of discovery in our own work, we are often proposing creative solutions, which by definition diverge from \u201ccommon\u201d sense. Of course, if you\u2019re trying to explain why 7pt type is a bad idea for an optician\u2019s website, you can get into the mechanics of readability without bringing your opinions into the mix. But as far as presenting novel ideas goes, it pays to present your thoughts as exactly that. I think.
