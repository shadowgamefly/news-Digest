His PER is close to average at 17.57, and for all the talk of his defense, he rates as a minus defender per DRPM, even while on a top defensive team. Throw in his below average assist and rebounding rates at the SG position, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he\u2019s been more than a really good 1-dimensional player. He\u2019s a phenomenal shooter; don\u2019t get me wrong. But for all the focus on advanced metrics these days, everyone seems to ignore them when evaluating Thompson\u2019s performance this year.
