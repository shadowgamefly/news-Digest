The people know how to spot a hypocrite when they see one. So much unpresidented criticism of our newly appointed Leader. To your credit, at least you avoided unhealthy \u201csatire\u201d in your remarks. The truth of the matter is that America has been longing for authority for some time now, and during the current process, with your help, Senator McCain, we are taking a great step towards fulfilling that need. Now we can make further progress in limiting the reach of the so-called \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d one of the biggest nuisances we have had to face over the years. And who would seriously deny that we need real authority, and that our \u201cconstitutional liberties\u201d have been taken too far? Who here, for example, would dare to defend the \u201cFirst Amendment dissent\u201d of a single so-called judge in our nation\u2019s leading criminal \u201csatire\u201d case?
