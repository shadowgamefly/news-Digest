Like in the interest of national security making Saudi Arabia, a brutal Islamic theocracy, our number one customer for weapons and strong ally against terrorism considering that is the nation most 9/11 hijackers originated and long known as the primary bank for terrorists? Like saying back in 2000 Saddam threatened our national security? How the hell could he outspend Saudi Arabia on terrorism? Like in 2005 you said a major problem for solving Iraqi conflicts mandates a reduced presence of our military in Iraq, only to push for a surge of military dominance in 2007? Like in 2008 you advocated a military presence in Iraq for over a HUNDRED YEARS? Why dont you show us the evidence you used to justify your vote for the Iraq invasion? Dont pass the buck like Clinton tried by claiming to be the victim of lies told by Cheney. Who the fuck is stupid enough to vote for a war without being able to readily provide the justification?
