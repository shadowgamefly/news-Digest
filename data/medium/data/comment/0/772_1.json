But I think you may be over-simplified the user personas based on the survey results\u00a0. I think a more denser scenarios would be related to user having personal account, credit card and home/car loan with the same bank and user wishing for single app to manage all those scenarios. UX becomes challenging in those scenarios. ICICI has all of these integrated and it is a great experience over there\u00a0! One of the feature that I want any app to do is to assimilate the typical user behavior and adjust menu or quick actions so that they can complete their task quickly. For instance\u00a0, \u2018Favorite number\u2019 was user driven activity that is mostly not used in smartphones whereas the \u2018frequent contact\u2019 as a feature led to fulfilling the same use case without any extra work\u00a0. Also find the blue iconography( not in the menu) in white background bit jarring to the otherwise nicely done design.
