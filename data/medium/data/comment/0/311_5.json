So many lonely people look at each person of the opposite sex they meet as their potential next relationship. It\u2019s desperate. I\u2019m speaking from experience. My honest advice is that you shouldn\u2019t be out there pursuing love. You should meet people and grow to love them as they are. Don\u2019t create a space in your life and try to box people into it, fall for someone after you get to know them and then make that space for them in your life. Until then, just work on being happy as you. ", "creatorid": "bb44d01c70c9", "timestamp": 1492261119095, "child": "", "username": "theshelfables"}
