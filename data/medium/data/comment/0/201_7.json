The two hour rule is almost similar to the Agile methodology of working in which we divide the work into small \u201ctime boxed\u201d intervals.Each piece of work has a start date,end date and the time interval will not get extended.The work\u00a0,which is not completed will simply move over to the next sprint. One more addition which I would like to add is that creative work requires a very high degree of concentration.So all distractions like email,mobiles and social media should be kept off\u00a0,in the \u201ctwo hours\u201d we are working to get the most out of it\u00a0!!
