Trump is making the WH as \u201cAll in the Family.\u201d That looks good though. We are told Ivanka does not want paid; but she is going to hire 10 people as her advisers and assistants for $120,000 each per year. These people will also travel to different parts of the world for support of her father. This will cost taxpayers another $1mil. We know Trump has a right to have relatives in his office. After all he won election without Repubs and TPs help. But having your relatives at work is inviting problems. He should ask me for my experience. Relatives tend to think they own your office and all customers are their slaves. In fact Ivanka is now controlling functions in the WH. Those White males will be side-lined; and I do not think they will like it. That will create clash between Trump appointees and Ivanka who may control the ins and outs of these white males now heading agencies. Thank God, Trump will appoint his ex-wives as ambassadors to their country of origins. Since they will be out of this country; it will alleviate tensions between ex-wives and his present wife. I can smell there will be fights in the WH soon between Ivanka and those white males now advising Trump. I am told one adviser is now out. I can\u2019t wait to see gloves come off in the WH.
