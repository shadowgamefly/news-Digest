Is hiring discrimination and bias already in the past, so every woman can afford to be choosy about job offers? Or can every woman afford living with no paycheck for months waiting for a prince\u2026 oops, a perfect team? Is a technical woman\u2019s priority to get the best for her skills or should she sacrifice those opportunities, since choices are limited? I dare to remind you, not all woman are created equally fitting a stereotypical \u201cwoman\u201d hole (race, age, transgender and such included, but also too nerdy, too feminine, not feminine enough, not into \u201cwomen\u201d projects, \u201cunwomanly\u201d confident, not a people person, way too technical, sounding too \u201cthreatening\u201d etc), some are struggling to just get a job, which is never perfect. It also applies to men who \u201cfail\u201d stereotypes. Notice, I didn\u2019t mention \u201cwhite men\u201d anywhere. I prefer to do sorting by \u201cis it a waste of time interviewing?\u201d. Interviewing is unpaid labour, which is not wise giving away so managers can praise themselves \u201cinterviewing diversity\u201d but nothing comes out of it for you. A job posting should sound like \u201cwe\u2019re hiring people for certain skills to do the job\u201d. Anything \u201cculture\u201d is indeed a big no-no. \u201cIdentity\u201d is a trap as it\u2019s not you making this call, don\u2019t think \u201cthis is cool for me\u201d, think \u201cthis is cool for them, but would they include me?\u201d. If you\u2019re an underprivileged woman, you may skip #3 and #4 (and #5 in some circumstances). You may even have better prospects with founders that are all men compared to a founder woman if you don\u2019t look like her. Especially, don\u2019t interview for tech jobs that are looking for \u201cwomen\u201d, to avoid competing with \u201cright women\u201d (not YOU) for a \u201cwoman\u2019s spot\u201d.
