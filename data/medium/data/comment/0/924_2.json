I don\u2019t typically think of ad tech specifically as analytics, although it\u2019s certainly related. If you want good FB data it\u2019s obviously important to install the pixel, although once you build out your own attribution model I would definitely throw Facebook\u2019s attribution data away. That\u2019s not until later though, and it certainly doesn\u2019t replace the lookalike use case. Re: attribution\u200a\u2014\u200awe use Snowplow Analytics as our web analytics tool, and then we build all marketing attribution custom, either in SQL or in Python, depending on the particular needs. The most important thing is having access to the raw data in your data warehouse, and that\u2019s where Snowplow comes in. You can apply whatever algorithm you want at that point. Hope that helps!
