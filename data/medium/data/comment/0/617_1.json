Instead of thinking of a way to implement something from this post, I\u2019d like to add an observation from it. Did you notice the ratio of reads to hearts?\u200a\u2014\u200a1.5% Nevermind views\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s look at reads. 2,269,158 people made it all the way to the bottom of that article.34,188 clicked the heart. Know what that tells me?  What people read and what they share aren\u2019t always the\u00a0same\u2026 A while ago, I wrote about how low the \u2764 rate is here. Ticked a lot of people off. A lot of people agreed, too. Some of the ticked off people gave me the best insights. Apparently, it seems that we don\u2019t always want our \u201cfollowers\u201d to know what we\u2019re reading. Most often, people didn\u2019t want others to know their political leanings. I won\u2019t speculate on why.\u00a0:) Makes me wonder if \u201csuccess\u201d articles are some weird kind of word porn.\u00a0ie; People want to consume it, but don\u2019t want anyone to know... Because\u200a\u2014\u200aseriously\u200a\u2014\u200a1.5% of the people that made it to the bottom clicked the \u2764?? What\u2019s up with that? So here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do after reading\u00a0this\u2026 I\u2019m fascinated by behavior and the study of response. It\u2019s kind of what I do.So, I\u2019m going to go through my stories and separate out by topic to see if I can find any correlation between topic and \u2764-rate. I\u2019ll post what I find. (if you\u2019re interested, follow me so you can see it\u2026)  If you liked this, please click the \u2764\u200a\u2014\u200athanks!
