Having listened to calls with both men and women as reps, I\u2019ve noticed the following trend: Prospects often won\u2019t take a woman\u2019s \u201cword for it\u201d as readily as they will a man\u2019s (especially when it comes to technical capabilities of a software). There\u2019s a tendency for prospects to ask women to repeat something, or to ask questions that force us to repeat the information in a different way, and so we tend to want to streamline what we\u2019re saying in the first place to avoid inefficient use of time. That might explain the finding outlined in the article, that women have a tacit need to speak more/interrupt/go on monologues during their calls with prospects. That said, given the percentages i\u2019m seeing, it seems like both the men and the women that were observed for this study are breaking the cardinal rule of selling anyway, if they\u2019re speaking more than 30% of the time\u00a0;) ", "creatorid": "b1aac4106ef8", "timestamp": 1490716598500, "child": "", "username": "annavirginiaedwards"}
