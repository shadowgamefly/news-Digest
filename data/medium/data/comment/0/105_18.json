However, when bashing on them for losing to the Suns and Clippers, it is important to remember that they didn\u2019t have Horford & Bradley for the Suns game and didn\u2019t have Horford & Jerebko for the Clippers game, leading to DeAndre and Blake manhandling them. It\u2019s very easy to see them winning at least one, if not both of those games with the fully healthy team they sent out against the Warriors. Regardless, if they can beat Denver Friday, I will gladly take a 3\u20132 record on the West Coast trip and run home with it. This team plays 11 of their final 18 games at home, including a 6 game homestand from March 20\u201331, and based on their strength of schedule, are still the favorites to be the #2 seed in the East. If anything my biggest takeaway is that there all 3 very good teams in the East outside of Cleveland (assuming Lowry comes back at 100%). This is a huge development because it means the Cavs will have to go through two legitimate threats to get to the Finals. While they are still the favorites to get there, this is the toughest road a LeBron led team has had to get through the East in years.
