I work in consulting (and have for many years)\u200a\u2014\u200aand my only comment is I think your estimates are a bit extended. If you would shave 5\u201310 years off your lower ends and 10\u201315 years off the higher end\u200a\u2014\u200aI think you are heading in the right direction. If you look at the big 4 consulting companies\u200a\u2014\u200awhich represent a million Type A people\u200a\u2014 (an unfair demographic for sure\u200a\u2014\u200abut more and more and more of them WFH\u200a\u2014\u200aor remotely away from the client site)\u200a\u2014\u200aand agree large percentage of them will be in leadership positions in an enterprise in the future\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not hard to see that a lot of what you are saying is only a generation away. Also\u200a\u2014\u200anice insight on factories\u200a\u2014\u200aso many people forget most of this will be automated\u200a\u2014\u200aand the actual workers (other than repair and maintenance) will not be local.
