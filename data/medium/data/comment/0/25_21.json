The man averaged a triple double, which nobody thought could ever be done again, AND led the league in scoring at over 30 a game. We might not see a season like this ever again. The only reason to give it to Harden at this point is because his team won 8 more games. However, when you consider the fact that Houston might have the coach of the year, probably the top two candidates for sixth man, and the Rockets roster is tailor made to fit Harden\u2019s skill set, I think that alone offsets the 8 game difference. Bestbrook is just more valuable to his team at the end of the day. Him not winning MVP would just be a result of the voters overthinking it.
