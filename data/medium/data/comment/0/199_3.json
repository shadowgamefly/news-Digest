I\u2019ll have to think about better tools that more easily support the next step in the process. I also collect quotes as I read, making sure to attribute them right then and there. That way I can integrate them into my work later. I may not even have a purpose for the quote, I just liked it. Sometimes I review them and it spawns a whole new train of thought. I often get hung up on the edit step. I have no external deadline, but also I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist. It irritates me when someone points out a typo or obvious grammatical error after I\u2019ve \u201cpublished.\u201d Do you have a system you use for editing?
