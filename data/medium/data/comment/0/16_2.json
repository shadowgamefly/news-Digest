I brought-up the Tweet\u2019phoon just before closing-out our Q&A with Jared, and a final question asked by an attendee was: \u201cWHY do you think everyone got so defensive?\u201d Jared\u2019s response imho was spot-on: that simply, as designers, we don\u2019t value ourselves or our skill-sets enough, to not feel threatened or territorial when it\u2019s suggested that (gasp!) a product manager might also be a designer. Sure, the hyper-fetishization of \u201ctech, tech, tech! coding, coding coding!\u201d may be partially to blame, but I appreciated how as an educator, Jared\u2018s taken ownership of that as a pedagogical imperative for our profession to evolve, for Centre Center to address.
