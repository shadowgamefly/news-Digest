I\u2019d add one more to your list, \u201cdon\u2019t wait for someone to \u2018let\u2019 you take charge.\u201d I\u2019m a developer and was in a job at a large firm where the one time I was asked to lead I was told \u201cyou just want things your way\u201d (yes? as an experienced lead, don\u2019t you?). Additionally, I got the promotions but was never \u201casked to the meetings\u201d and didn\u2019t have a seat at the table. Being ignored is such a powerful and discrete way of discriminating. Luckily for me I don\u2019t wait for someone to tell me I can do something. I do what I want and have side projects where I lead and move forward. When I found I had the luxury to not be in that situation, it was those side projects that have carried me through.
