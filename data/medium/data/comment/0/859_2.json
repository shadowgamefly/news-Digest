I wonder if anyone has looked at it from the perspective that computers do not have anything analogous to the system of hormones that living organisms have in order to feel. Hormones that are released from different glands hit the bloodstream and course through the body, causing us to feel different things. A shot of adrenaline causes us to feel fear or anger. Testosterone can cause aggression or the urge to mate. Endorphins cause euphoria, and so on. These have nothing to do with computation. Would an artificial type of hormonal system be necessary for a computer to feel? An even scarier scenario would be if computational power alone could produce self awareness, but feeling required something analogous to hormones. We could end up with computers with self awareness, but no capacity for feeling or empathy. ", "creatorid": "1f24c785c253", "timestamp": 1490058490116, "child": "", "username": "marksalamon"}
