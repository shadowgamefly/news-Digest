And I think its simply awesome what you are doing. 4 years of undergrad, 2 years of Masters, and 3 of PhD and I still feel that the most important thing that I learnt was way back in the fourth or fifth grade. If only it had been taught properly. Academia always lags behind in that sense. I appreciate that you are trying to fill the gap. Good Luck!", "creatorid": "2e5c66e3d37f", "timestamp": 1492178811240, "child": "", "username": "position_trader"}
