Our company straight abandoned our self-hosted blog for Medium when we ran an experiment. I started posting the blogs I had written there on Medium, and they started taking off. Once I hit a few Top 20 with the articles I had written we looked at our traffic and were blown away. In one month, we were getting our entire traffic FOR A YEAR on Medium. We decided to innovate (or die like BlockBuster), and I think that\u2019s the bit of advice I can offer. No one heads to other people\u2019s websites to binge watch videos, they go to YouTube. People aren\u2019t heading to wordpress sites to read their work anymore, they go to Medium. Live Stream? Twitch.tv. I think cross-promotion on sites is irrelevant (and is becoming RedBox). Pick the platform people use and have your website be nothing more than informational with links leading them to where content is native. It\u2019ll save you more time and headaches in the long run. Keep writing! Love your work! ", "creatorid": "25cd1cc62d2c", "timestamp": 1492220366307, "child": "", "username": "benjaminsledge"}
