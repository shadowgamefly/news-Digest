I get some reprieve from the nosy, judging questions because (I believe) I only have use of one hand (a whole other thing; I think that people assume that I don\u2019t have children because I couldn\u2019t take care of them with my disability, which isn\u2019t necessarily true.) But in reality I\u2019ve never felt the need or desire to be a mother, despite enjoying children and spending time around them. I started saying this in high school, and I was told I\u2019d change my mind. I haven\u2019t. Before the disabilities were a factor, I found myself answering questions about not having kids and being accused of being selfish, and it\u2019s not something I miss. I have couple friends that are childless-by-choice that tell me that they get asked when they\u2019re having kids, or why haven\u2019t they had kids yet, all the time, and it seems to me the height of presumption\u200a\u2014\u200athere could numerous reasons why a couple wouldn\u2019t want to talk about that (besides the fact that it isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business.) The assumption that people want to talk about this personal matter with anyone and everyone makes me angry. There are plenty of kids in my life that need a strong, caring adult female figure (some as many as they can get!) I am very happy to be that for them. I don\u2019t feel like I need a child of my own. Great article. ", "creatorid": "ee4d3bb179b5", "timestamp": 1491532278178, "child": "", "username": "GirlWithTheCane"}
