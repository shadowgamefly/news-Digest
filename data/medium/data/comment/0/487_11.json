I\u2019ve received judgmental comments from friends with children about the fact that my partner and I use our disposable income to travel, or buy bikes (something we love to do), we also chose to live in a very small home. One thing I could not have anticipated in my twenties however, is how lonely it would be in my forties. My friends are still my friends, but we rarely do anything together, we are often left out of invites, and the number of our contemporaries with children are very few. I\u2019m not sure how that is resolved, other than waiting for when their children are older, or making new friends that are significant older (which we have done). You are right that it takes a strong person, and a strong relationship with your partner, to weather being outside the norm.
