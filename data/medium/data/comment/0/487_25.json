I\u2019ve known since I was a child I didn\u2019t want to have children. Now 53, and I never changed my mind, no matter who tried to convince me otherwise. I got into the habit, when people asked me why, I would ask them, why do you WANT to have children? Can you provide an articulated reason? Most of the time, they couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just something most people do because they think they\u2019re supposed to. In the third world, children are a safety net where none exists when people age. But I don\u2019t live in the third world. (But yes, I do have 4 cats.) ", "creatorid": "31b0ca7119a0", "timestamp": 1491668334265, "child": "", "username": "lindamarshall_64988"}
