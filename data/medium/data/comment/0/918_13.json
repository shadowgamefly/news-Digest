As a man I think I lack credibility on the subject and as the spouse of a stay at home mom I think I might not even be welcomed in the space. But since we share a relatively rare event, being held hostage at gunpoint, I am risking it. That experience also changed my life, starting me on a spiritual journey but that\u2019s a whole different story. I just wanted to comment that I agree women should not be discouraged from seeking growth in any field, with full ambition. But many, like my spouse, may still choose full time family operations and maintenance as their career and passion. Men may also make that choice. That was her decision and she has not regretted it. It has risk, becoming dependent on the man\u2019s resources when he might end the marriage being a huge one. But all of life, every choice, has risk. Well written post.
