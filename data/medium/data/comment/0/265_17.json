Presuming sportswriters liked Obama and not Trump because of the way they talk about sports? Missed the mark again. This is a president undermining our constitution and protective instutions, from the judiciary to the media to science and education. This is in no way business as usual. Sportswriters didn\u2019t react this way to either Bush, they loved Reagan and Ford. Trump has attacked journalists and the media daily. Your continued normalization of his attempted coup of our government is traitorous and infuriating. Please stop.
