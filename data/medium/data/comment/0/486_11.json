One might be tempted to, um, let\u2019s call it \u2018stray\u2019 if one does not possess the internal standards that separate \u201ca meal\u201d from \u201ca date\u201d from \u201ca conquest.\u201d I would bet the Vice President does not have those urges, though. My guess is he wants to seem pious and religious, so he keeps up this outward strict almost-Puritanistic code of behavior. The downside, as you mention, is that female journalists would be limited in access. And photos like the one shown show only middle-aged males at the event. The optics suck, Mr. Vice President.
