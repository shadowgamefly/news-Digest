This law says that at some point in time creation and good must always be offset by destruction and evil\u200a\u2014\u200astars are born and stars die. In human terms for example peace is offset by war and love by hate. The superstious among us tend to equate the positive to God and the negative to Lucifer (the Devil.) In fact probability balance has nothing to do with Gods or Devils, it\u2019s hardly any different than Newton\u2019s law of action and reaction. Yet because of the law of probability balance it is inevitable that giant negative forces throughout history like Hitler and Trump come into play no matter how much we abhor them. The bottom line of this rambling comment is that while those of us who are fact based persons will find this particular story amusing as \u201cHell,\u201d there exists, sad to say, a huge portion of humanity that will see this tale as the literal truth.
