I\u2019d say I hate to toot my own horn, but since clearly I don\u2019t, I encourage people to check out Cherry City Pulp, my first novel. I guarantee you\u2019ve read nothing like it before. Blurb is below. Casey McGregor is a high school sophomore living in Salem, OR who lost the birth lottery\u200a\u2014\u200aabandoned by his mother to an alcoholic father, he wastes time playing Call of Duty and shooting \u201cstuff\u201d in his back yard. A friend of the homeless, hopelessly bullied at school, Casey manages to do well enough, trying simply to ride everything out until he can graduate and leave for college.But the shootings have drawn the attention of the police and young lawyer Courtney Lawson, who\u2019s forced to go on ride-alongs to learn Salem\u2019s beat\u200a\u2014\u200aand ensure the cops don\u2019t foul up the DA\u2019s investigations. As the inquiry continues with no suspects, Lawson muses on her past and the contradictory and often confusing world of men and relationships.Removed from the controversy and born lucky, Hunter Foxx, playboy star shortstop for the San Francisco Giants heads home to Cherry City for the offseason thinking of women, fishing, and some well-deserved vacation. Little does he know Salem has it\u2019s own black hole for him: 17-year-old Destiny Smotherman\u200a\u2014\u200aa generational beauty, young, voluptuous, and innocent, complete with a fake ID and a nose for trouble.Like Casey\u2019s father, Mr. Scott\u200a\u2014\u200ahis teacher\u200a\u2014\u200alikes to drink. However, he loves his students and is well liked by most everyone\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept for North\u2019s administration, who don\u2019t take kindly to his emails about student safety. Black clouds gather, and Mr. Scott soon finds he either needs to keep his mouth shut or kiss his job goodbye.\u00a0As the tale wends and weaves, our characters\u2019 stories become intertwined, stakes are raised, and justice is doled out to all involved, culminating in an American tragedy with which we\u2019ve become all too familiar\u2026A whirlwind of satire and social commentary, Cherry City Pulp is at once familiar and foreign, boldly challenging the reader\u2019s notion of what is\u200a\u2014\u200aand is not\u200a\u2014\u200amoral, right, and just.
