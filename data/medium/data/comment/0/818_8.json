However, I think a better code reusal would be to leave \u201ctweetIsEmpty\u201d untouched and involving it into the new \u201ctweetIsOutOfRange\u201d feature. So extending the functionality instead of renaming it. This way tweetIsOutOfRange would be built upon already existing knowledge: tweetIsOutOfRange: function() {\u00a0return this.tweetIsEmpty || this.charactersRemaining < 0;\u00a0} However this is fully subjective\u00a0:) Personally, for me it was not so logical to get rid of the function we already built in step2. So this is just a very subjective feedback. Keep up the good work!\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "865ce4f94fba", "timestamp": 1492339933459, "child": "", "username": "jozsefdevs"}
