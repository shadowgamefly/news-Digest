Should economists start reviewing movies? Should the lifestyle magazine editor tell you where to invest your money? Look, you basically got every prediction wrong leading up to this election. You looked at the data, and came the wrong conclusion as to who would win, how they would win and the mood of the American people. Doesn\u2019t that tell you anything? So why should we insist on listening to you know babble on something you don\u2019t understand? You don\u2019t know the intricate workings of DC. You have already proven to be incredibly biased and have allowed that bias to cloud your judgement. You are completely out of touch with the Average American in you liberal bubble. What value in your political commentary is worthwhile? Stick to writing crappy internal monologues on the Cowboys and how Joe Buck really isn\u2019t \u201cthat\u201d bad.
