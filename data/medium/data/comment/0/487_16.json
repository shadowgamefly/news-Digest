To other people, it invalidated my marriage. It wasn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d because we didn\u2019t have \u201creal\u201d responsibilities. Suddenly this also meant that I have an easy divorce because I don\u2019t have to divide human assets. Less paperwork, sure\u2026 but a legal battle to end a relationship is never easy. On the flip side, people are now ecstatic that I can now date and pursue a new relationship to find a father for children I never want to have. The right guy isn\u2019t going to change my mind. If anything, the right guy will support my decision to not have children. ", "creatorid": "68640fbcd7cb", "timestamp": 1491583806054, "child": "", "username": "zoeylikesit"}
