I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to suggest CBS could\u2019ve just cut the whole thing. Varner spoke his accusation it at the most un-editable part of three-days of footage, and he was sent home without a vote for it. There\u2019s really no way to air that without an explanation unless you want them to make up an alternate ending and play act. Past Survivor seasons have dealt with racial issues, domestic abuse, mental illness, bullying, and other problems as they arose. This is part of this story\u2019s season now. It\u2019s part of the story now for all of those castaways, and it will no doubt play a role in the gameplay moving forward too, like it or not. Is Zeke \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d now because of his powerful moment? That\u2019s an icky question but you can bet it will be asked, whether it\u2019s aired or not. I do wish you had talked about Sarah\u2019s response as well. For a woman with her background to respond that way in that moment was very powerful too. I certainly responded differently watching it than I would have five or ten years ago. I\u2019m still processing it, but given the horribleness of what Varner said, I thought the reaction by everyone else was quite beautiful.
