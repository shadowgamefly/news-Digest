Our brains are really smart and while you start with a very slow transition in the beginning, you can speed up common transitions. This seems to work really well in practice. It\u2019s up to you to figure some good ballpark figures for timing however. E.g. one slick page animation that usually takes 1 second, could begin at 2 seconds, with 1.5 seconds on the second go, then 1.3 and slowing down over hundreds of iterations to ~0.6s.
