I am disgusted, and you should be too, that Obama foolishly ignored DUI\u2019s when considering whether illegals should be deported. That is absolutely astounding to me. Trump got elected, in part, by his promise to reverse Obama\u2019s weak stance on illegals. Since it is obvious that the public wants action against illegals, I can\u2019t figure out why you would write a story that tries to normalize drunk driving by illegals???
