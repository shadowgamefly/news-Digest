I write them because I enjoy crafting the story, researching places and things. So far I have written 8 stories, that range from 55K words to almost 95K words long. It is funny that writing \u201ccareer\u201d only came about after I was put on antidepressants about 6 months ago. Up until that point anything I wrote was usually just in \u201cbullet points\u201d. I didn\u2019t enjoy writing, it was something that I had to do as part of work or something like work. Maybe being depressed was stifling part of my creative brain, I don\u2019t know. I just know that when I write I enjoy it. Now I have read all (well not all) of the different things about how to be a successful writer. When I write, I think I violate all the basics, I write with my TV on above my desk, I stop and check emails, or go get something to drink/eat (sometimes in the middle of a sentence)\u00a0\u2026 the only things that I don\u2019t do are check Facebook, Twitter, etc. because I don\u2019t use them. Some days I only write maybe 500 words, or none; other days 3 or 4 thousand. And on more than occasion write a thousand words only to delete them. So what to do if no one reads your efforts? Sit back on a windy day and re-read them yourself. If you enjoy them you have satisfied your most important target audience\u200a\u2014\u200ayourself! And from someone that is also overweight a big smiley face to you on your weight loss! ", "creatorid": "ba5dceb02cd6", "timestamp": 1491673743767, "child": "", "username": "bobbysammons"}
