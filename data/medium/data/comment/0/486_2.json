Has it not occurred to anyone that the \u201cBilly Graham\u201d rule can be viewed from many different reference points?\u00a0The progressives posting here seem to assume that all women are cast as temptresses and that all conservative men have no self control.\u00a0The point they have missed is that many \u201cliberated\u201d women (like me, who is a Gloria Steinem vintage biochemistry professor) like the \u201cBilly Graham\u201d rule. And that has nothing to do with temptresses or lack of self control. In fact, most conservatives that I know are neither temptresses nor lacking in self control.\u00a0The point of such a rule is appearances.\u00a0People used to be concerned more with appearances\u200a\u2014\u200awhich are very useful to a conservative\u2019s progressive opposition, which seeks any opportunity to cast the conservative an any unfavorable light, deserved or not. And FYI, the original motivation for preserving \u201cappearances\u201d is not even protection of self from angry opposition, but the very important principle of setting a good example to and not scandalizing the young. I can say very confidently, that even though I\u2019m not a Billy Graham evangelical but a Catholic, not a man but a woman, and had not heard of the \u201cBilly Graham\u201d rule until recently, I probably pretty much followed that rule myself as a common-sense woman, and did not feel that it impinged on my career in any way. People really need to mind their own business and stop being so moralizing and intolerant. When you attribute nasty motivations to other people, like many are doing here with Pence, you are only betraying your own angry and suspicious nature, and you own potential lack of self control.
