Russ has done something that we all believed would never happen again. Averaging a triple double in a season isn\u2019t even possible on video games and I feel like people are overthinking the easiest MVP decision in history. Records matter and this is a historically great season that can\u2019t be overlooked. Harden was great but denying Russ the MVP is disrespectful to NBA history.
