Had you noticed that notifications of new articles have been switched off at the moment. I\u2019ve seen it reducing significantly over the past few months and now it has stopped altogether. This coincides with folks having very few views, likes, comments and shares as a result. I notice your article of April 10th has just 37 likes and you have 27,372 followers! And there are no comments either. Surely this can\u2019t be right, my engagement with my articles is grinding to a complete halt. In addition LinkedIn on mobile has rolled out the ability to switch off certain notifications, the switching off of article posts must have more or less coincided with this, they have been messing around with notifications and maybe inadvertently switched the global switch off for articles! \ud83d\ude44 Let\u2019s hope it comes back soon, in the meantime I will for sure try out some of your hacks to get more activity there, it won\u2019t hurt. Success with LinkedIn Pulse! ", "creatorid": "cf0c72db5b17", "timestamp": 1492121699017, "child": "", "username": "stayingaliveuk"}
