We have a problem.\u201d When any one thing (including democracy) cannot be openly questioned, then you know that you do not live in a free society. But you seem to miss to have missed the point that both the Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s election were both examples of democracy in practise. You do not get to call for democracy and then suggest it is somehow not really democracy when you don\u2019t like the outcome of the vote. I am of the very firm opinion that one of the reasons the British people voted to leave the EU for example was because they were tired of being dictated to and they were tired of being told that certain things could not be questioned. The Brexit, if anything, was a vote for democracy, not against it. ", "creatorid": "e91a7dc9cd62", "timestamp": 1492288620234, "child": "", "username": "svetlanavoreskova"}
