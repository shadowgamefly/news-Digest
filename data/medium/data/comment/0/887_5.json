Someone said alone was lonely. It\u2019s not. Alone does not have to be lonely. Lonely is a longing for someone, a decision that you need someone who is not present. Alone is a state of being by oneself. Lonely only comes into the picture when we decide to create it. If lonely exists, start telling others you want a partner. A partner will appear. (If you actually think I believe this\u2026. you are wrong. It\u2019s hogwash and I know it! I can\u2019t believe I even wrote it. It\u2019s like I was trying to fight off loneliness myself. Actually, I\u2019ve been lonely my whole life with and without partners. If loneliness exists\u2026. it exists. All the self-talk in the world won\u2019t change it. I guess I like to deny it\u2019s existence. I want lonely to go away.) Keep remembering. ", "creatorid": "97be9ed7c5ac", "timestamp": 1489943035403, "child": "", "username": "stevewardrip"}
