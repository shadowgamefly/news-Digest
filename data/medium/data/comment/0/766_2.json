I have found this is not necessarily about laziness\u200a\u2014 or that entrepreneurs aren\u2019t capable of talking to users. In fact, unfortunately, most of the time they don\u2019t want to know the truth. They are married to their idea. And they are married to creating something. The truth gets in the way of that. If they make something first, they can always blame the product later if it fails\u200a\u2014 missing features, took too long to launch, etc\u200a\u2014 instead of facing the reality that they didn\u2019t understand the market or customer. It\u2019s easier for them to take a hit to their wallet (or an investors wallet) than to take a hit to their ego. To be clear, this mentality represents the bad entrepreneurs. It's just unfortunate that I run into this more often than not. ", "creatorid": "9a16db4bcf2f", "timestamp": 1460378078650, "child": "", "username": "paulgonz6"}
