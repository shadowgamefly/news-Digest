I am pleased that some Leaders reacted immediately\u00a0: http://www.timesofisrael.com/chinese-leader-calls-for-palestinian-state-with-east-jerusalem-capital/ The colonization process started many decades ago. Key western leaders asked to \u201cstop\u201d the colonization. None seriously demanded a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d. Therefore, behind the nice WORDS, they were all conscious accomplices\u00a0! Indeed, today, the \u201cArab State\u201d is not at all viable, with all these colonies & iraelian military control of the whole land. As long as most parliamentarians (US, but also british, french, etc) are unconditional \u201cFriends of Israel\u201d, they will pass all necessary decisions for this foreign country. Also, when people complain about discriminations against the palestinian Arabs, they do not comprehend that, FROM THE BEGINNING, the State of Israel has been created as a \u201cReligious State\u201d. Not a \u201cdemocratic\u201d State. There are many religious states in the region. By definition, people who are not from the specific religion of the \u201creligious state\u201d will NEVER have the same rights\u00a0! That is what happens in Israel (a democratic Constitution giving GUARANTEES for equal rights to all was \u201cexpected\u201d in 1948, but has never be issued\u2026). Many disciminations are being addressed by some israelian NGOs\u00a0, like https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/7189 ", "creatorid": "c19adf5a4c17", "timestamp": 1485098837420, "child": "", "username": "Ciron"}
