He set out to write about the horrors of war and the evils of modernization. The world was shaped as he wrote. I remember reading about a letter he\u2019d written to someone (font remember who now) about arriving where his heroes Frodo and Sam met Shelob. In the letter he indicated that he didn\u2019t know what to do or how to get his heroes out because he\u2019d created something so powerful that just the two of them were completely incapable of overcoming it. For me, that really meant that he hadn\u2019t built his world, but allowed it to come into being as he wrote.
