As a neopagan, I get a lot of fanatics telling me that I\u2019m going to Hell for not worshiping Jesus (who would probably have been the first to say that Adonai, not he, is the one to worship) and yet claim that God is love. There\u2019s a reason why I consider Giordano Bruno to be my spiritual brother\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the things he said before being burned at the stake for heresy by the Catholic Church in 1600 was asking why Jesus was able to win followers by giving money to the poor, feeding the starving, healing the sick, and so forth while his followers had to resort to torture, terrorism, and murder. Then again, when you see street preachers shouting at people about how they\u2019re going to burn in a lake of fire for all eternity for not going to the right church, is it any reason why many people have a distrust and dislike of mainstream Christianity, and why attendance rates at churches have fallen substantially? My greatest fear is that the ones who stay in modern Christianity won\u2019t be the ones like you that practice instead of preaching, but the moralizing hypocrites who spew vitriol at anyone who doesn\u2019t make a show of being \u201cholier\u201d than everyone else. Like the Pharisees, they are \u201cwhitewashed tombs\u201d, indeed\u200a\u2014\u200apretty on the outside, full of rot and corruption on the inside.
