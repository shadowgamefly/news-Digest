However, Medium\u2019s primary business and reason for existing is not politics, and given the divisiveness of politics in the US today and the bubble-ization of media, Medium risks limiting the TAM of its primary business to people in just the left media bubble. That\u2019s bad business. I\u2019d love to see Medium emerge as a place where all views are welcomed, but which focuses its attention (and the material editors call to members\u2019 attention) on the center, particularly where left-center and right-center are looking for (or at least open to) finding common ground across the aisle. From a practical perspective, it would be really smart for Medium to create a \u201cblock all political content\u201d button that\u2019s easier to find and press than its \u201cunsubscribe\u201d button. [Political note: I was a lifelong card carrying moderate Republican, as was my father who held a low level political appointment in the later years of the Reagan administration. However, my Party here in California lost its way, ostracizing moderates like me as RINOs, and I am now an independent who considers candidates and issues on their merits.] ", "creatorid": "f0c5384faf05", "timestamp": 1491515720740, "child": "", "username": "FStevenChalmers_59683"}
