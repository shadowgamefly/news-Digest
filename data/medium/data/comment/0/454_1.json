The Obama Administration, for instance, took a wide-ranging view of what were considered personal events hosted by the Obamas, leaving off celebrity sightings and meetings with top donors. It also maintained the right to leave off those brought in for sensitive meetings, like interviews for federal judicial nominations. Obama-era officials took other steps to circumvent the logs, scheduling meetings with lobbyists and others at nearby coffee shops. In other words. Who cares? No president in history has ever released the logs until Obama did, and he only did it after fighting it every step of the way. And most of what Obama\u2019s administration released had the names redacted. The coverage of this \u201cissue\u201d is absolutely bizarre and just another reason why Trump won the election ", "creatorid": "646615db4e96", "timestamp": 1492204723937, "child": "", "username": "thermo321"}
