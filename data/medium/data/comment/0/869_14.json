Of course most of your audience is fine with that simply because technology people tend to heavily lean left. Not all of them though.When I read about technology I really enjoy when it\u2019s about technology and not politics and author\u2019s ideological leanings. I don\u2019t care about Democrats and Republicans. I am neither of them. I just want to learn. This particular article could\u2019ve been written completely without unnecessary political indoctrination. And it would\u2019ve been much better.And of course, as a citizen, you have a full right to express your political sympathies but do you seriously think that FreeCodeCamp is a place for this? Like it or not, not everybody in this country and among FCC students shares your political views and if you turn this awesome platform into political indoctrination thing it will be a terrible shame and a huge loss for everyone.The society is already divided enough. We all need to step away from politics and focus on what we have in common. In FCC we all love technology and programming. Let us build things but not walls.
