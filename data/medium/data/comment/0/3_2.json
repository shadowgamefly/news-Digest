These were two sites I used a lot for my searches back in 1990\u201391. Since I didn\u2019t even know if they existed anymore, I tried them both. Lycos still works and has certainly changed a lot. Altavista changed as well. Now it is called Yahoo (it must have been acquired by them).\u00a0:D Thanks for the smell of old times.
