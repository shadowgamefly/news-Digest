I remember referring to your book when starting android development 3 years back, it\u2019s been a long journey from then to now (full of mixed feelings). With new projects, I try to maintain a right mix of old and new APIs and conventions for system architecture. I find myself taking notes on how APIs work. Going through their documentations and seeing if I miss out on any of the APIs features. This technique applies to the APIs I\u2019ve used previously. For new APIs I see samples, I do a lot of (mindful) copying and pasting. As for patterns and system architecture I\u2019ve miles to go. Great piece, and yes I\u2019m a happy coder\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "34f272d67281", "timestamp": 1456289399180, "child": "", "username": "Rakeeb"}
