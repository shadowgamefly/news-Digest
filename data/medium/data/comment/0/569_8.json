And that Yhwh God established the system of sacrificial animals under the original covenant, to teach the Israelis that there was a HIGH cost to sinning; that it required BLOOD atonement, to reconcile the sinner to Yhwh God? THAT is the reason that Jesus came and died on that cross: to provide that blood atonement for us all, once and for all; so the \u201cviolence of redemption\u201d is a NECESSARY component to salvation. Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin! You would take the message of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation OUT of the Gospel of the Kingdom, like so many preaching the \u201canother gospel\u201d Jesus and His apostles warned us against so frequently. There HAD to be blood shed to reconcile us with Yhwh God; and that blood had to be sinless: the ONLY 1 Who could offer such blood was Yhwh God Himself, in His incarnate form, as Jesus. The saying that sin put Him on the cross, but love kept Him there is the message of the Bible. And that plan of salvation for humanity was presented from as early as Genesis chapter 3; but it was in place before man walked in the Garden, because omniscient Yhwh God KNEW mankind could NOT keep His commandments on his own merits, and would fall into sin, before it happened. So He planned for and provided a remedy, just as He provided a ram to take the place of Isaac on Mount Moriah, aka the Temple Mount, all those millenia past.
