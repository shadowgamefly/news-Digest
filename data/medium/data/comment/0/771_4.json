As a good rule of thumb, you want to avoid a slow ease in as it makes the responsiveness \u2018mushy.\u2019 I include some industry standard easing numbers in my Principles Manifesto Regarding the ease out, if you can\u2019t watch it the 100th time, you should\u2019t use it the first time. Everything you design should be built to be viewed 100+ times, so I don\u2019t see any justification for a \u2018single use\u2019 design interaction.
