We\u2019ve lost our ability to engage in passionate discourse without being labelled an \u201c-ist\u201d or a \u201c-phobe\u201d by those who can\u2019t argue a case on merit or logic and instead wish to shut it down by creating legislation that prohibits words. And we\u2019ve lost our love of country, of self and of our society; replacing these instead with a self-loathing, guilt and a desire to surrender ourselves and our future to anyone pure of will and clear of intent. Almost everything we\u2019re seeing is straight out of the marxist-socialist \u201cplaybook\u201d, but wrapped in social justice and sold to us as morally \u201ccorrect\u201d. Orwell\u2019s prescience was profound. Sadly, we had more than 50 years to learn the lesson but instead we considered his warnings as a roadmap. And yet, many here cheer and applaud as they willingly guide the blade onto their own necks\u2026 ", "creatorid": "7e261ddc1c4f", "timestamp": 1492243087674, "child": "", "username": "paulboicovitis"}
