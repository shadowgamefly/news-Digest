Since so many people get their news from Facebook there is no question that FB enables a lot of trolling, hate-speech and misinformation that gets distributed on the web. How about FB hiring a team of independent best-in-class, non-political fact-checkers, working with algorithms, that rate the accuracy of news article/posts. Give them a grade (say 1\u201310 on accuracy) and post that grade with the article when a user posts it. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be done in real time; fairness in determining accuracy is most important. Later, when users learn the system, FB adopts an e-Bay reliability metric that gets attached to the poster. This will identify the trollers for what they are and encourage participants to fact-check on their own before blindly posting trash to distribute. It will enhance FB as a distributor of quality information, improve the national dialog on issues of the day, and render the rest as the garbage that it is. By the way, it will also encourage news outlets to be more accurate in their reporting. FB has enormous power here to improve news and information distribution around the world.
