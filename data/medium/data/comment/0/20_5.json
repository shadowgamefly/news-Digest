I love the fact that agritech is becoming more abundant. Now, on the other side, I have to say that I cringe when I think of Silicon Valley taking on farming. My belief is that when these companies get investors it becomes more about profit and elite needs than providing for the community it works from. A company must provide for a chef willing to pay 60$/pound for something s/he will charge hundreds a plate for and then having these farm companies turn around and wonder how to provide affordable food to the people around them seems just a tad hypocritical and what I\u2019ve come to expect of SV in general. You know what\u2019s the best way to provide affordable nutritious food for the low-income communities? Provide nutritious food for the communities. Take the VCs out of it and focus on the communities. I know it\u2019s a tall order but it\u2019s always the same:the rich benefit from the resources in poor neighborhoods and inject a certain amount of obligatory guilt when they can\u2019t figure out how to fit the people around them into their business model. Trying making them your business model! I live in the Caribbean and have a farm. The goal I have is to feed me and mine first, then provide for the local community and to an extent the restaurants/hotels because to me that just makes more sense. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to make the community my business model because in the long run, the money will come, I believe. It\u2019s tough because this is a total bootstrap operation but maybe, just maybe, I can pull something off. Anyway, great article again!
