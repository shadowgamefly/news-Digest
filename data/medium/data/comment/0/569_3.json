The Death and Resurrection symbolizes the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox. The Sun God descends below the Horizon for 3 days and 3 nights to resurrect/rise again for the next Solar year to provide for a bountiful Harvest. This is the symbolism of Jesus, the crucified Sun God. It is the glorification of Human Sacrifice. It is Hidden Cannibalism. It is the gruesome exploitation of human emotions that secures the powers of a most corrupt and abusive priestly class. God has nothing to do with it. Question what they preach instead of preaching without questioning. Jesus of Christianity, historically, as in real history, not propaganda history, Never Existed. We are being taken for a rather cruel ride. ", "creatorid": "d24e84230d78", "timestamp": 1492340978026, "child": "", "username": "Lillibeth"}
