Honestly, I get my best work done behind the keyboard in about 20 hours of the week. Between 20 and 30 hours I\u2019m at about 80% efficiency. Anything more than that, like you said, is just trying to force it and can actually be counterproductive. Can\u2019t speak for everyone, but most good ideas I have for programming come when I\u2019m afk AND outside the office. This makes a good balance very important to my actual productivity. Good article on an often a misunderstood subject! ", "creatorid": "305ed653ec35", "timestamp": 1491832704120, "child": "", "username": "michaelculpepper"}
