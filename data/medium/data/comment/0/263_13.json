This article is a total self parody, compete with an affluent Ivy League protagonist using a fake English accent as to sound un American. Him sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Harvard Square discussing the rise of Trump is like having Iron Maiden watch \u201cThis is Spinal Tap\u201d. They don\u2019t get the joke because they are the joke. American hating socialists in the media, you\u2019re time has come and gone, thank god, and as this unintentionally hilarious \u201cstory\u201d forever demonstrates, you were a repulsive, self serving bunch with no ties or any concerns with real working class Americans. This piece should be placed in the library of congress as to help explain how Trump wound up in the White House. It explains everything. What a gruesome gruesome lot.
