They should rapidly build on all of the \u201cdisputed\u201d land to eliminate any idea that the Palestinians can use terrorist tactics to win back land they lost when they picked a fight with Israel. We need to remember that all of the land they are complaining about was lost when they tired to exterminate all Jews from the area. Palestinians have been trying to exterminate all Jews as their primary goal for a very long time now. There has never been any movement with the Palestinians to accept Jews as deserving of life. Another thing to remember is the Palestinians do not actually belong there, their historic home was in Syria, but they were kicked out from Syria and every other Arab Nation because they were always seen as criminals and thieves and beggars. There is no Arab Nation willing to let them live in their borders in any numbers. The \u201cONLY\u201d way a two State could exist is under very specific and non-negotiable elements: Palestinians Must control all of their people and end all terrorist behaviors and take responsibility for showing Jewish people that they will never again allow terrorist acts.Palestinians must accept the disputed lands are gone and can never be returned, it is the penalty they must endure for starting and losing a war to kill all Jews, this loss of land is their penalty for those war crimes. If these two conditions are not met, there is no possible way a two State solution can be found.
