I am completing a Masters in \u2018Economics for Transition\u2019 at Schumacher College, part of the University of Plymouth\u200a\u2014\u200aour course is one of the very few\u200a\u2014\u200aif not the only one\u200a\u2014\u200ain the world that starts from the premise that neoliberalism is broken and we need a new model. If you\u2019re looking for that model, I can only recommend Kate Raworth\u2019s newly published book: Doughnut Economics, 7 ways to think like a 21st century economist. She has been described as the John Meynard Keynes of the 21st century and her book is a perfect critique of neoliberalism, followed by a road map away from it. She\u2019ll be touring in the US soon. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doughnut-Economics-Seven-21st-Century-Economist/dp/1847941370 ", "creatorid": "f20ba411dd2f", "timestamp": 1492242709863, "child": "", "username": "mandascott"}
