Ben Franklin already summarized it: early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. Every morning do something for your health, wealth, and wisdom. Think about it. Health is your foundation\u200a\u2014\u200ait makes everything else possible. Money brings freedom\u200a\u2014\u200athe freedom to live the life you choose. Knowledge is power\u200a\u2014\u200athe power to do and become. After 5, 10, 20 years, the compound interest from this constant investment daily practice is both figurative and literal. I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s the secret to \u2018a good life.\u2019 Funny to call it a secret, but that\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s wisdom hiding in plain sight. The Benjamins (Franklin and Hardy) understand it and have told you about it, but few of you will really do it. Doing it takes more than motivation, it takes a system and a plan.
