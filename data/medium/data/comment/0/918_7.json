The easy way out includes definitions supplied to us by our parents, teachers, male superiors, religious leaders and society at large. By accepting someone else\u2019s definition of what each of us SHOULD be, we are diminishing the possibilities that lie within. It takes soul searching and work, over a lifetime I might add, to recognize those possibilities that lie within. How can someone else REALLY know what your needs are, what your abilities are, what provides you with joy?? That is why I high lighted the quote above\u200a\u2014\u200ait is so true. I just added a different frame than you did, Nataly. I also high lighted your point about career success that \u201cits difficult.\u201d Career success is difficult for all of us, regardless of gender. Yes, there are societal norms in place -for centuries I might add- that make it more difficult for women. LIFE IS HARD. Remember that. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. Remember that too. Find your joy, find your bliss while serving other sentient beings here on\u00a0earth. ", "creatorid": "92158ba1a0fc", "timestamp": 1491596802666, "child": "", "username": "lindaarobinson"}
