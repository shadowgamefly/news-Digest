I\u2019ve been fortunate that the only times I\u2019ve been as limited in mobility as you are have been relatively brief but I get it. And I\u2019m in a couple of autoimmune arthritis groups\u200a\u2014\u200aone for PsA which does involve spondylitis for some of us, one more general including some with AS and some with spinal involvement from RA. These groups have a number of activist types in them. I just shared this and United Airlines *will* be hearing about it. I expect you aren\u2019t inclined to ever fly with them again, but they must make changes to ensure that no future passenger is denied the right to travel with his or her mobility device.
