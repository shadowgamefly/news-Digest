A foreign dignitary stays at a hotel owned by Trump, and the hotel fee he pays, which is used by the hotel for its operations and does not pass to Trump, does constitute a bribe. With no quid pro quo. Whereas, the more than one hundred million dollars that passed from Russian hands to the Clinton foundation during and shortly after our government, meaning Obama and Clinton, were greenlighting the transfer to the Russians of direct ownership of one-fifth of all US uranium production, along with other business benefits, that money does not constitute a bribe. Even though the quid pro quo is directly obvious: US assets in exchange for money to Clinton. Somehow Democrats never recognize all the tens of millions foreign governments and dignitaries were pouring into the Clinton Foundation as bribes. Or the millions Bill was being paid by foreign governments and dignitaries for a few minutes of his time giving a speech, as a bribe. But let an ambassador stay at a Trump hotel, \u201cImpeach him! It\u2019s an Emolument!!!\u201d If these Foundation \u201ccontributions\u201d were bona fide expressions of charitable motivation, why did they stop the instant Hillary lost the election? Isn\u2019t the Clinton Foundation just as much a charitable enterprise now as before the election? The answer is obvious: it was never a charitable enterprise; it was always a device to launder bribe money, and one doesn\u2019t continue bribing people who lose the election. The Left would be wise not to keep raising this issue at all, or you might push the DOJ into investigating the Clinton Foundation. You don\u2019t want that!
