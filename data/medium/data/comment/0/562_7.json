But this is where I get stuck\u2026 \u201cShould We Have A Moral Responsibility To Refugees?\u201dFrom your story it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cyes, of course.\u201d I\u2019ve heard other similar stories and my heart shouts and squirms and says, \u201cthese are people; help them! Show them rescue.\u201d But when I hear the question from a governmental/policy perspective it isn\u2019t the same. I don\u2019t have the heart strings to a policy, I have heart strings to people. So, while I\u2019m comfortable saying we, our country, our people have a moral responsibility to help others, I do not have that same comfort saying our country as a government has that responsibility because as an organized government it has a tightly defined responsibility to its citizens and that responsibility is always at risk of great conflicts of interest when other \u2018responsibilities\u2019 are suggested, mandated, or thrust upon it.
