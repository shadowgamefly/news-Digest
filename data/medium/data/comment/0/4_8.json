I was able to write four to five hours most days as a reporter. I now log about an hour each day. But my experiences as a teacher breathe life into my stories.

I feel less pressure now. Having another skill truly is beneficial. ", "creatorid": "fb574d0a8cc5", "timestamp": 1492014659569, "child": "", "username": "TylerAgnew10"}
