Everyone bitching about their opinion being right and those of others being wrong. There are many truths being stated on both sides however those comments without any consideration for opposite opinions are fundamentally the cause of the breakdown of global democracy. People may disagree with the current political climate, but to leave? If people truly believed in America, they\u2019d stay and work through it. All countries have their issues, and the one commonality is that they are all complicated. I am Canadian and love my country. However, I\u2019ve worked with Americans my entire career and love them (and their country) too! Different, yes. Wrong, no. Make no mistake about this fact. Canada has it\u2019s issues too. Our healthcare system, although different, is fraught with it\u2019s own issues. And, we have one of the world\u2019s most looming environmental disasters called the \u2018oil sands\u2019. Although our politics and fundamental beliefs may be somewhat different, none of us a smart enough to determine either is right or wrong. The fundamental problem is few of us are prepared to work through issues so the result equally benefits all. A \u2018winner takes all' mentality eventually loses. Clare, I fully understand your sentiment and support your freedom of choice. Fundamentally, that freedom is allowing you to do what you are doing and the opposing views being stated in these responses.
