I\u2019ve been spent the last few days playing around with the concept of just using transform and opacity. One problem I\u2019ve found is the issue when animating children elements to show inside a parent. If I just use opacity 0, it leaves the parent element with an ugly whitespace of where the child will be. I tried using transform scale to remove this gap in the parent div, but this only distorts all other children within the parent element. I haven\u2019t come across another form of transform that could do the job.Does anyone have a good recommendation about how you\u2019d animate a parent element to grow with the child, so the whitespace isn\u2019t existent?
