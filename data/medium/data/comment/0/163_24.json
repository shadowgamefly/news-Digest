I don\u2019t know the person who said this words\u00a0. But what I learned from this is that don\u2019t resist change\u00a0. Just embrace it\u00a0. Make a difference. Just when caterpillar thought the world was over\u00a0, it became butterfly\u00a0. Why go behind new apps\u00a0, why don\u2019t we create a new one which never existed before\u00a0. Wow what a great advice\u00a0. He is right why don\u2019t we start a new chapter. Some people are meant to cross our path for a reason\u00a0. One day you will make a difference\u00a0, you will be the change\u00a0. Thanks for sharing it\u00a0. It\u2019s a great one\u00a0. Loved reading it\u00a0. It touched my heart\u00a0.
