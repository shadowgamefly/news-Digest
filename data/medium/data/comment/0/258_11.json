Certainly, as many others I wake up to my Instagram Engineering and Medium profiles. Yet the whole day continues to linger around these two moreish apps\u00a0. I wasn\u2019t quiet happy with the stories section even when snapchat kicked it off first. May be I hated it as snapchat doesn\u2019t seem to have a calculated UI that amuses its users.
