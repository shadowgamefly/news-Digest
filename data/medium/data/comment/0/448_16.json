I laid out a response here. https://twitter.com/baratunde/status/826449152296906752 Wanted those on Medium, including you, to see it. Your language is simultaneously defeatist, condescending, and disempowering. Your argument that there is more going on is sound. However you position it as THE truth and you communicated the real pain of the EO and the real physical activation of citizens as ineffective and too little. I think you need to try harder to be less harmful in your approach. There is nothing in your post suggesting you have direct experience with the consequences of the EO. Nothing saying if you\u2019ve ever been involved in protest. Nothing to establish your credibility on the matter. Yet you\u2019ve judged and harshly so. And you\u2019re wrong. Do you know how hard it is to get people out of their homes to physically stand up? For anything?? It\u2019s hard. We expect on-demand everything yet families of all races and creeds stood up for refugees and Muslims and immigrants. WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THIS ACTIVATION. You as a head of product should be able to see the value of this step. But all you could see was what you ASSUME is missing. Please try to be more helpful. I know you mean well, but this did not help. Try asking \u201chow can I help?\u201d Rather than declaring \u201cthis is what is going on.\u201d ", "creatorid": "ad966fc159b6", "timestamp": 1485879430558, "child": "", "username": "baratunde"}
