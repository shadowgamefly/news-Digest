Demographics are demographics and when it suits them White males lean on demographics heavily. They are what they are and until they learn to confront their individual racism and consciously change their own behavior, the discussion will continue. We do not have an ethnic problem in the US. We have a White problem and the sooner that surfaces and gets fixed the sooner we can all move on. Thank you so much for speaking up on behalf of all of us who\u2019ve \u2018been there\u2019 and just kept going because there was no other choice.
