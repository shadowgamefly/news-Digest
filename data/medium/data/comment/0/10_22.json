I\u2019m a cyclist and runner as well, and whenever I\u2019m in China I think about how out of the ordinary it would be to see a cyclist riding for anything other than utility/locomotion. That jogger\u2019s nod and wave here in the US? You can bet that happens in China, because if you see a counterpart, you *know* it\u2019s indeed a rare sighting and worthy of acknowledgement! Thank you for reading and for sharing your own story. ", "creatorid": "f4c355bbcaa9", "timestamp": 1492360074359, "child": "", "username": "peterpann"}
