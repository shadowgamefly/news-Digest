It would have to be increased by a factor of 2500 to be considered \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cnotable.\u201d To give it the great power claimed is a crime against physical science. CO2 absorbs 1/7th as much IR, heat energy, from sunlight per molecule as water vapor which has 188 times as many molecules capturing 1200 times as much heat producing 99.9% of all \u201cglobal warming.\u201d CO2 does only 0.1% of it. Pushing panic about any effect CO2 could have is clearly a fraud. There is no \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d in an atmosphere. A greenhouse has a solid, clear cover trapping heat physically. The atmosphere does not trap heat as gas molecules cannot form surfaces to work as greenhouses that admit and retain energy depending on sun angle. Gases do not form surfaces as their molecules are not in contact. Only liquids and solids have molecules in contact. The Medieval Warming from 800 AD to 1300 AD Michael Mann erased for his \u201chockey stick\u201d was several Fahrenheit degrees warmer than anything \u201cglobal warmers\u201d fear. It was 500 years of world peace and abundance, the longest ever. Vostock Ice Core data analysis show CO2 rises followed temperature by 800 years 19 times in 450,000 years. Therefore temperature change is cause and CO2 change is effect. This alone refutes the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis. Methane is called \u201ca greenhouse gas 20 to 500 times more potent than CO2,\u201d by Heidi Cullen and Jim Hansen, but it is not per the energy absorption chart at the American Meteorological Society. It has an absorption profile very similar to nitrogen which is classified \u201ctransparent\u201d to IR, heat waves and is only present to 18 ppm. \u201cVegans\u201d blame methane in cow flatulence for global warming in their war against meat consumption. Carbon combustion generates 80% of our energy. Control and taxing of carbon would give the elected ruling class more power and money than anything since the Magna Carta of 1215 AD. Most scientists and science educators work for tax supported institutions. They are eager to help government tax more money for them and enjoy being seen as \u201csaving the planet.\u201d Read the whole story in \u201cVapor Tiger\u201d at Amazon.com, Kindle $2.99 including a free Kindle reading program for your computer. We have an inexpensive demo-experiment \u201cCO2 Is Innocent,\u201d 99 cents at Amazon.com, showing CO2 has no effect on IR heat absorption up to 10,000 ppm and then it cools the atmosphere by driving water vapor out as it is seven times the IR absorber/heater as CO2.
