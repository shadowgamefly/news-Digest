You arbitrarily defined it as such. And if you think that saying a movie near the bottom of the distribution of scores (which anything 5 and below would be) isn\u2019t a barely watchable movie is maybe a misunderstanding of how most scores in movie review sites fall. I\u2019m not sure you actually gave clear thought to what I was saying. You arbitrarily chose a particular view of how to judge what a good distribution was without any clear justification for having done so. It\u2019s fine that you think it was okay, but it wasn\u2019t rigorous and didn\u2019t lay on any kind of foundation aside from your own incorrect belief of what the word \u201caverage\u201d meant.
