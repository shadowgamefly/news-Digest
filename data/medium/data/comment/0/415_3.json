These are, after all, people who demand that taxes on the wealthy remain low just in case they win the lottery. When my dad started teaching at Clinch Valley College in Wise, VA, in 1957, the general thought was that coal as an industry would not last forever and that it provided few residents with real prospects for the future. And now, by blaming Obama for \u201ckilling coal\u201d as many locals have, they are ignoring the 60-year-old writing on a whole lot of walls. There are some community leaders there who are offering legitimate goals for new opportunities that might help. The problem I see is that, as a voting bloc, the message this community seems to be sending is \u201cjust bring back coal.\u201d This would be like Roanoke, VA, saying \u201cbring back the steam engine.\u201d Or the rest of us demanding that they bring back black and white television. But, as a twenty-year resident of Wise County, I think the real shame is the four-decade-long refusal to consider the future at all. From staunch and rampant denial of the dangers and costs of mining and burning coal to the easy-buck political shift that turned Southwest Virginia from a union-strong land of plenty into a powerless, penniless, drug-addled hellscape, the people of my hometown have made one disastrous decision after another. And now, with Trump, they\u2019ve completely turned their backs on the only people actually trying to help them, and made the worst decision in recorded history.
