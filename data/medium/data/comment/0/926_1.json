About a month ago there wa a fascinating report about two professors who restaged segments of the Trump-Clinton debates, but reversed the gender of the candidates. It turned out that Trump\u2019s words and mannerisms presented by a woman were far more persuasive and far less offensive, and Hillary\u2019s presentation as a man was far far worse. BTW, most members of the audience were West Side NYC residents, and mostly Hillary supporters. I suspect the same psychology could be at play in these sales calls, i.e., assertive sales tactics are acceptable when practiced by a woman, and rejected at a higher rate when practised by men. Far more controversial is the possibility that male and female sales people could make demonstrable improvements in their closing ratio by adopting gender specific sales scripts, based on the gender of the salesperson. Women\u2019s 11% higher win rate while violating long held and often tested sales processes is too large a number to ignore.
