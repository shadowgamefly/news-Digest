Franks, whose wild-eyed ignorance speaks ill of our state. In fact, Arizona\u00a0where\u00a0medical\u00a0marijuana\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0legal\u00a0for\u00a0awhile, came within a whisker last November of legalizing recreational use of marijuana (an initiative many believe failed only because of the self-dealing monopolies for current dispensaries written into the proposed initiative). No one, least of all Rep. Franks, brought up the issue of the many nuclear warheads that surely would flood the market along with locally grown produce. His belated idiotic bleats aren\u2019t worth the listen. And marijuana in this overwhelmingly libertarian state will become fully legal, probably next year, without fear of radiation poisoning -- unless one is speaking of the radiation of Republican fear-mongering, which will need to intensify with each authoritarian failure implemented by our nation\u2019s Liar in Chief.
