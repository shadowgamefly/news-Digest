His family has been dealing with Russia in business for over a decade so any ties between his company and Russia predate his Presidency. People have been looking so hard at Russia for who is pulling strings they are missing his central control which is the Mercer family. He had no connections to Bannon before his campaign so why was Bannon chosen for the highest levels of access? The same reason Kelly Conmyway became his \u201ccampaign\u201d manager, which was not true at all but only a move by the Mercers to hit back on his dismal record of treating women like property instead of people. (Can you even count the number of times apologists referenced her as evidence he does not discriminate against women?) If Russia was influencing him there is no way he would have dropped a single missile on Syria. The Mercer family and Bannon are not simply partners in white supremacy, but in the destruction of the DC systems beginning with the GOP. Why do you think his admin is doing everything possible to ensure the riot-natured tone of GOP townhalls become only more hostile? In one run-on sentence, it seems like a complete waste of time to force disclosure of tax returns because regardless of contents, he will never admit to being dishonest and will always claim he is the victim of a conspiracy because white wealthy men are always being blamed for the world\u2019s problems. The most alarming and apparent agenda of the Mercer family is to bring us and allies into the next global war and Bannon will never be completely removed from the Trump Admin because he is their number one inside guy.
