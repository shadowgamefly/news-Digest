As you build your types and you document that code, it automatically becomes information available to the client coder through introspection with tools like GraphiQL. That is a huge time saver for the devs building the API and those using it. The other winning aspect is, it is a specification which forms a standardization (whether it becomes A standard is still to be seen). At any rate, being a specification means great tooling, easier usage, wider interoperability among services all are much simpler to achieve. I think that alone makes GraphQL hard to avoid.
