They get one of the worse backup pgs in the league, to add to their already terrible collection, and they get a shooter who simply cant shoot. Awesome. This trade neither makes them better for a playoff push, (which is apparently what they are trying to do?), nor builds for the future. The bulls just traded their best big and a fan favorite (gibson) and a guy who is their best shooter and who they traded two picks to move up on just three years ago (Doug) for Cameron Payne and filler. Good god, this bulls team is bleak. Just fire GarPax already and burn the whole team to the ground. Disgusting.
