I like to think of this as something like the MVP-Vote, which, while it can\u2019t be determined by pure stats and/or achievements, needs a vote among experts. Right now, MJ is still the G.O.A.T. in the eyes of most experts. He will probably keep this unofficial status, but LBJ has crept closer and closer in recent years. After all, this is the hardest thing to get, and while LBJ is already 32, it should take a whole career for anyone to be really sure. However, an improbable title for Cleveland could heavily speeden up that process. After all, LBJ has just recently passed MJ in career minutes played. If you think about it, LBJ\u2019s 2015 Finals performance was his most underrated achievement. What he did without Love and Irving was probably more than what Michael did in on or the other Finals\u2026 You could also argue that while LeBron\u2019s Eastern playoff competition has been significantly lighter than MJ\u2019s, the foes in the Finals for LeBron have been much more fearsome than those of the 90s. #lebron #mj #goat #cleveland ", "creatorid": "6dcfc1dbb2fa", "timestamp": 1491831192318, "child": "", "username": "ismail.ozgenturk"}
