In the past they have made up stories about al Qaeda or other terrorists coming through the Mexican border which was proven to be a lie. The GOP are big on creating issues that do not exist like illegal Hispanic immigrants taking jobs or committing crimes neither of which are true since immigrants by statistics commit fewer crimes than average citizens and more jobs have been shipped to Hispanics in Mexico than undocumented Hispanics have ever taken like under Bush-Cheney. Under the Bush Great Recession of deregulated banksters\u2019 subprime mortgage fraud $17 TRILLION was taken from Americans, five million+ jobs lost, and 10+ million jobs on top of the five million manufacturing jobs shipped overseas and 60,000 companies shipped overseas or to Mexico under Bush-Cheney. Same with the voter fraud lie which does not significantly exist. In reality, the GOP\u2019s nationwide voter suppression laws cheat thousands of voters not counting the nine million ex-felons, mostly drug-related blacks and Hispancs, denied the right to vote as the GOP on the wrong side of demographics have to lie, cheat, and steal to win elections.
