I remember I was at a F500 a few decades ago (you can read my CV to piece it together) and this one field operations manager was promoted into a staff position where he oversaw special projects, etc. He was used to line authority where what you got done was more valued than how you did it. He saw himself as efficient, orderly, neat\u2026 all those things that were valued in GTD. A few months into the job he was viewed by his peers and bosses as someone who was never on top of the projects he was managing because he wanted to talk and show results rather than process. He came into my office one day after hours when everyone else except us both went home and shared his frustration. My advice? \u201cPut tracking charts, Gantt charts, maps with pins on your walls. Look busy, look like you are in a Control Room.\u201d We laughed a bit about that, but he started doing this (I didn\u2019t think he would, but it was genuine advice!) and he transformed his peers' and bosses' perception of him as an operations recalcitrant to a power center where projects were in control with him at the helm. Sales people started selling more complicated projects because they became more confident he could implement them. Truth is, he was always good at GTD but now he looked the part. Anyway, that example popped into my head and always does when people complain about \u201cthe process\u201d or \u201cmeetings are a waste of time\u201d or when people want to just \u201cdo their job\u201d instead of being part of the process. Even in a highly digital culture, it still applies! Thanks for this story. You hit all the high points square in the forehead.
