Some wonderful lines like: \u201c We pictured an existence free of Republicans, Christian fundamentalists, global warming, telemarketers, reality TV shows, eyeliner, stamps, parking tickets, kale, and junk mail.\u201d The inclusion of kale is perfect.

You should also put in in Literati Magazine. Ren\u00e9e (publisher) would love this too! ", "creatorid": "870c6bc39de8", "timestamp": 1491386917741, "child": "", "username": "rcormack"}
