I\u2019m a Medium peeper, which is to say I peep into Medium on my outdated, tiny phone when I\u2019m between life\u2019s obligations and have a minute. It\u2019s fun and amusing and educational and relaxing and all that rot. But lately I\u2019ve suffered from Medium Peeper List Exhaustion Syndrome, commonly referred to as MPLES. It\u2019s a crushing psychological syndrome wherein the sufferer is trapped between time too short and list too long. Here you go, we all know the deal: \u201c35 things to do before you take your first piss every morning.\u201d And what list designed to make me better in the morning doesn\u2019t include a cold, fucking shower? And this list is what all the cool shuckers do to perfect their cool shuckiness. I like your stuff here on Medium and thank you for your efforts. So many lists, so little time! Thank you.
