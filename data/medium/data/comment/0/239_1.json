Multi-site development teams, imagine the team is spread in Japan, China, India and US. In most cases people are jockeying for positions, because of different cultural backgrounds, cost structure and other reasons, so, it is not easy to build trust! When their is a big choice to be made, again it is very hard to confront and agree on the outcome. Some of the team members think going right and some going left as the right path! So, it is very hard to get consensus when disruptive technologies are at play! In my opinion, it is not five, it is really two important points, the balance between trust and accountability! Like any relationship. Are you in an environment that you feel \u2018together\u2019 and do you feel supported when you can say the way you see things! Then results are the outcome! To make this happen, constant training is required to keep teams in sync also, keeping team sizes small. Good example are from sports, teams are limited in size!
