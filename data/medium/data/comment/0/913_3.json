I suggest to read Pope Francis\u2019s Encyclical \u00ab\u00a0Lausato Si\u00a0\u00bb. If the Believer follows his/her heart and faith, a new fair world can be constructed. The Encyclical talks of concepts like the ones you mention (plus many others, as the encyclical is quite long\u2026). But it says where the problems are, and indicates \u00ab\u00a0lines of approach and actions\u00bb (chapter 5). Within Democracies, by definition, the people have the power to decide of their future. And, over decades/centuries, the people get what they have collectively constructed. Jean P.
