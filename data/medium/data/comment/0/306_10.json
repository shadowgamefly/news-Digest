I have purposely avoided watching the news for the past few months because there\u2019s so much negativity and chaos out there that its hard to stay engaged, and keep an optimistic outlook. BUT stay engaged we must, otherwise, everything will just continue on a downward spiral. Love your satire and it does work in reminding us, motivating us. It\u2019s also very courageous of you to lead the pack. I, and most of us here I\u2019m sure, do recognize the risk to you when you put your \u2018malarkey\u2019 out there for the world to see. I certainly appreciate your \u2018heroism\u2019. Yes there are a million ways, 7 days a week, 24/7, to show that we as a nation, RESIST!
