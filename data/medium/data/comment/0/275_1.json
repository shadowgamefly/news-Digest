It has astonished me for years that there is no governance in place over which technologies should be roled out. The people have no voice in these matters other than as consumers. Scientists have to prove their science is fit for humans, for medical applications for example. Advertisers have codes they have to comply with that put limits on what is in the public interest. And yet technology only answers to shareholders, with public interest being an afterthought. That said, big pharma or food manufacturers are regulated. But economic power trumps political power these days, with lobbyists no more accountable than algorithms. But imperfect governance is surely better than none. Thanks for raising the issue here.
