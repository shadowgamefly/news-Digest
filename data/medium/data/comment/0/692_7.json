It sounds like you\u2019ve just encountered too many people who try to make Worldbuilding into more than it is meant to be, or less depending on your perspective. Each story needs its own level of worldbuilding, be it minimalistic or intense. Different stories require different amounts and types, and different readers will be drawn to the stories that fit their amount and type of worldbuilding. I don\u2019t think we need a new word to convey a concept that is already in the original, we just need to teach the original concept accurately. I don\u2019t think any Worldbuilding teachers are pushing the idea that you have to have everything planned out to the finest detail or you have failed. They are mearly trying to help their students think about concepts which they might not have thought of before, elements which may, or may not be incorporated to improve their storytelling.
