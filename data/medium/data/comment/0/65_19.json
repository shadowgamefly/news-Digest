He will turn it up in the postseason, but the dearth of quality defenders will cost them.The league is still about matchups. Cleveland (currently tied for the #1 seed) is 0\u20134 against the current 8 seed Bulls, and 4\u20130 against the current 7 seed Pacers. Last year Cleveland swept the Pistons and Hawks and didn\u2019t overly exert themselves against the Raptors so they were pretty fresh for the Finals: this year they are likely to have a tougher slog if they make it back to the Finals, which will have an impact when they try to keep up with the Western Conference champion.
