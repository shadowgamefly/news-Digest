They take our money, spit in our faces, and dare us to do anything. If they want to build colonies on conquered territory, we shouldn\u2019t be helping pay for it. Face it. They never intended for there to be a viable Palestinian state, and what they have now is an apartheid state where Israeli citizens have favored status and the people that they conquered are not even second class citizens. Apartheid. Shame on them. ", "creatorid": "8095ee3c5d82", "timestamp": 1483239945887, "child": "", "username": "rikelswit"}
