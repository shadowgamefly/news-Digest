I feel like we\u2019re on the cusp of a Reformation, and oddly enough it will be lead by the Millennials in our churches today even though everyone seems to look down on us. A reminder I gave to a group of fellow Millenials on Ash Wednesday I think drives this home. I told them: \u201cWhether you like it or not, you\u2019re the future of Christianity and the church. The world already sees enough dirtbag Christians that aren\u2019t kind in their speech, generous in their actions, and are more hateful than compassionate. If you want that trend to continue then, by all means, keep being cultural christians. But if you no longer want dirtbag to be synonymous with our faith, you better start living it. You, in this room, decide our future. Dwell on\u00a0that.\u201d ", "creatorid": "25cd1cc62d2c", "timestamp": 1490320622961, "child": "", "username": "benjaminsledge"}
