There\u2019s always a deadline for work or a dog that needs walking or dishes to be done, etc. It was bothering me that I wasn\u2019t writing much at all and I set a pretty modest writing goal and just forced myself to try to write do it every day. As the days passed and I reinforced the habit, I bumped the goal up a bit and these days I write 750 words a day. I\u2019m not quite at 100% (I miss maybe one or two days each month), but on the days I don\u2019t manage to get to it, you can bet that it\u2019s the first thing I do the next day. Plus, now that I\u2019ve started writing on Medium (and elsewhere), I\u2019m actually writing a lot more than just 750 words a day. Starting with a modest goal and building up was the key for me. Solid advice. I enjoyed your piece. Thanks for sharing. ", "creatorid": "7f668677ddc3", "timestamp": 1489624306107, "child": "", "username": "ShawnMacDonald"}
