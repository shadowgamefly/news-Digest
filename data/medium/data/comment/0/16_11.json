But many times the truth is that companies recrute us as magicians or unicorns, thinking we\u2019ll create a wonderful UX just changing hovers interactions and buttons colors. The last point in your article is a situation so many designers used to be in. It can be very hard for a designer to get CEO\u2019s attention, to be real part of the product strategy. So yes, many designers have to accept that they are not kings of user experience, but only facilitators with the responsability to make every one part of design evolution. But also every one in the company should be aware that design is not about aesthetic, and that they (as engineers, QA, sales, CEO, COO, CPO, CFO\u200a\u2014\u200aso many \u201cC\u201d and \u201cO\u201d\u2026etc) have an impact on the user experience no matter what.
