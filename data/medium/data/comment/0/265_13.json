The companies that they work for also determine what attitude they have and what they can say. The fact that some of the most influential sports institutions (SI,ESPN) management leans left has probably helped lead to more left-leaning sportswriting/reporting. Networks like Fox Sports, even though they are considered \u201cconservative\u201d, seem to allow their employees to more freely speak their minds. I actually enjoy reading sportswriting articles on the relationships between sports and politics, but when a sportswriter tries to be a political writer that also writes about sports, those articles can be just not fun to read and frankly sometimes just bad writing.
