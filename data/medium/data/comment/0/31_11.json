If you had a player like Westbrook, or Curry or James playing as hard and as great as they do but they are on a TEAM that is having a crappy season, how does that make them less valuable? Their team\u2019s overall performance shouldn\u2019t affect an outstanding PLAYER\u2019S value. In fact, I would think the opposite would be true. If a player can play that well with little or no support from teammates (or coaching/managing) then it would seem they are even better than a player on a contender. Or, I should say, having a better season. The team isn\u2019t up for the award, right? And if the rest of the team isn\u2019t playing that well, it seems to me it would be MORE DIFFICULT for one player to shine, since the opposition would be able to focus more defense against, say, LeBron. I mean, if they don\u2019t have to worry so much about defending against Irving or Love, they could put more pressure on James, then, if he STILL has a great game, with the added defense against him, isn\u2019t that indicative of him, well, being a better player? James being double-teamed and still scoring twenty must be playing better than James scoring twenty man-to-man, right? I never got the mentality of ONLY voting for players on a winning TEAM when you\u2019re supposed to be voting for the PLAYER. It\u2019s an individual award.
