The threat of eternal roasting in fire and brimstone kept me in the religion for more years than I care to admit, until I realized that endless fear is no way to live one\u2019s life. Christians should believe because the presence of Jesus in their lives is indespensible, not because they don\u2019t want to be tortured by demons for eternity. I\u2019m an athiest (who believes in universal, infinite consciousness) now, but it warms my heart to see a Christian actually walking the walk.
