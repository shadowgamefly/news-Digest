So, for instance, the extension of your MainActivity.java would be \u201cMainActivity_.java\u201d. You may use Ctrl + Shift + N(Android Studio / Windows) to find it or just Ctrl + Click over the class declaration and the IDE will guide you to it. Then you can put breakpoints wherever you like. Although I have to recognize generated code may be bit hard to understand at first\u2026 but as you get used to it, it will look simpler (like everything else in programming ). IMPORTANT: The things that could create difficulties are injection related errors. They are perfectly reflected in the \u201cbuild\\generated\\source\\apt\\androidannotations.log\u201d log file. But for some reason Android Studio doesn\u2019t shows those errors (Eclipse does). The IDE just tells you it couldn\u2019t find the generated classes and yes\u2026 this may be confusing if you don\u2019t know where to look. Hope this helps\u2026 Thanks for writing ", "creatorid": "62fe0911d090", "timestamp": 1490276074614, "child": "", "username": "maykel.meneses89"}
