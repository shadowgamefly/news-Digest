IMHO, the biggest issue we\u2019re facing isn\u2019t stories which are outright fabrications, although that\u2019s a big problem. The more corrosive stories are those which do cite upstream sources correctly but then bend the context surrounding those facts in such a way that stories are very misleading, even though they might be factually accurate. Just now, for example, I was looking at a story that went around a while ago that claimed that Pres. Obama \u201conly\u201d attended 42% of his intelligence briefings. It cites a GAO report which uses that figure as well. What the story leaves out, however, is that the briefings which he did not attend were those in which he had the information delivered to him in written form and that he followed up with a variety of other methods. The headline and the takeaway were, of course, was that the President blew off most of his briefings, when in fact, the opposite was true. If we automate the detection of stories which are factually inaccurate but not those which are misleading through their omission of relevant detail, we may end up increasing the perceived validity of the latter. We should proceed with caution. ", "creatorid": "d3de8a9167ac", "timestamp": 1479947468139, "child": "", "username": "mikeplace"}
