Something unsettling happened at the last three writing conferences I spoke/taught at. The students and I were deep in Q&A about writing\u200a\u2014\u200ainspiration, craft, being blocked, keeping on when one wants to give up. Then a student said something like, \u201cA friend of mine published her own book and is promoting it on the internet. I want to learn more about that.\u201d In that instant, the energy in the room changed. In one instance, a panel member who ran her own press spoke for fifteen minutes about all the things a writer can do to promote her/himself, including the instructions to \u201cDevote at least 90 minutes a day to promoting yourself on social media.\u201d We never returned to talking about or being with the writing. The writing. The hard work of writing\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially for a new writer. I decided that I would not take part in the selling before the writing, not for myself, not for my students.
