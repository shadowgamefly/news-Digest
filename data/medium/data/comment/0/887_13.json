Of course, it will pass. I know you know that but daaang, it sucks when it hovers over your chest and fogs up the mind. When I traveled through Israel, I had bouts of feelings of isolation and aloneness. Sometimes I felt I couldn\u2019t continue but then I did and you will too. Remember your connection to the earth, the sky and wind. Remember the trees and birds. I had a profound experience just sitting under an ancient olive tree during a wind storm. I felt and understood my primal connection to all things familiar or not during those few hours. I\u2019ve never doubted God and His care for me since. You are never alone. Spirit is eternal and your very DNA is made up of connection even when you can\u2019t feel it. And, for what it\u2019s worth, you have a tribe of people cheering you on. So proud of you!
