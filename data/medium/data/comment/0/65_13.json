Jordan was the GOAT in 1988. Just as he was in 1991 (when the moronic \u201cgatekeepers\u201d finally allowed him to hold the title because he had won a title). The GOAT is someone who, at their prime, is better than everyone else. This was always MJ. This isn\u2019t even hard. Everyone knows this (as your boss would say NO ONE DENIES THIS). All this bull about \u201cif Lebron does x, then he has a better case\u201d just obscures what this whole thing is about. Who was the better player? MJ. Period. Are stats and titles and whatnot good for supplementing the discussion? Sure. But for crying out loud, no one ever said of LeBron in Year 4 that he was the GOAT. Or year 6. It\u2019s only after last year (which was phenomenal, of course) that this crap started up. You can\u2019t be the GOAT because you lasted longer (thanks evolving body science!) It\u2019s just who\u2019s better. Leave it at that. You want to say LeBron had the better career? Sure, whatever. But he isn\u2019t the GOAT. That much is OBVIOUS. Just like Gretzky. These are the only two sports where it\u2019s this obvious. But, man, is it obvious. ", "creatorid": "d21ca80fb93", "timestamp": 1491832785005, "child": "", "username": "UW_Oberon"}
