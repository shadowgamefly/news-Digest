I\u2019m going to share it with my current class\u2026 though it has to come with some disclaimers. Posting here because it seems like you would be happy to listen. There are a couple of things about this post that it evoke some of the same insensitivity and erasure of trans/queer experience that it presumably is trying to help. The first couple are from the quoted passage, which is otherwise good, but it would have been nice to see an addendum. The word \u201ctransgendering\u201d used as a verb is usually a red flag for people who are transphobic or trans-exclusionary. A small thing.\u201cAnd queer people too, but we all know all of that already, or should if we are paying attention.\u201d\u2014People aren\u2019t aware of this and it\u2019s another little detail the feels like queer experiences are glossed over. Cisgender and/or heterosexual people, who claim to support trans and queer people, will still say insulting things directly to our faces while remaining completely oblivious. (Perhaps the original text was targeted for a queer audience, explaining that assumption? In general this is not a safe assumption to make) The last is from your words: 3. \u201cMeanwhile I\u2019ll take my vagina elsewhere.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aobviously this comes off as implying that vaginas == women, which is untrue if you look outside of purely cisgender, non-intersex bubbles. These kinds of comments are frequent and part of the general trend of excluding trans people from even being included in the discussion.
