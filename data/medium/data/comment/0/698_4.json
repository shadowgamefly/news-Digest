I am really glad that CBS didn\u2019t try to build this episode up beforehand as \u2018must-watch\u2019 and I think they did a really good job of treating what Varner did and how it affected Zeke with respect. It got a little sanctimonious, especially for a show that hasn\u2019t always treated its contestants with the proper respect, but it was a moving episode and left me feeling a little icky but not emotionally manipulated (which is a major contrast to say Adam\u2019s experience of playing while his mom was dying of cancer). The show had a \u201cmoment\u201d but didn\u2019t try to capitalize on it, which is remarkable in this day an age, even if it shouldn\u2019t be.
