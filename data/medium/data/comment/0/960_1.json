I have struggled with both vapor and solid states of tests, and both are equally bad for the team, usually walking hand in hand which is the worst scenario. From my empirical experience I dare to say that the undesired test states are more likely to emerge in an environment where the developers are not the owners of their test automation specially the highly socialized tests. Would be awesome to have a tool that give rank numbers to the tests taking their historical state into consideration. It would help to identify solid, liquid and vapor states. Which in my opinion would be a much better metric than coverage for example. Let\u2019s build this tool?\u00a0;) ", "creatorid": "8e73bb43c26c", "timestamp": 1478521015641, "child": "", "username": "juraci.vieira"}
