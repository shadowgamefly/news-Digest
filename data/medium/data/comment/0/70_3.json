Both their pathetic defensive numbers and the eye test (i.e. my head and my gut) both contribute to my malaise. They may never \u201cget it together\u201d in time for or during the playoffs. They could really use some younger guys. I won\u2019t complain about the Wiggins for Love trade, but what really still gets me is the Bennett selection in the now underrated 2013 draft. So many players from that draft would now look really good in a Cavs uniform: Giannis (obviously), Gobert, McCollum, Adams, Oladipo, Noel, Porter, even Olynyk, etc. I know 20\u201320 hindsight and all, but The Cavs brain trust really valued Bennett over ALL of the other players I just mentioned?
