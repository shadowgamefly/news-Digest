You will find that they are completely discusted with the fact that all of the breaks go to the ultra rich. They are discusted and angered that big corporations are backing theses people. The problems is that they do not see democrats representing them. They feel as though they are being made fun of for their beliefs and the republicans like Cruz understands them. Wake up DCC you have to invest in the communities and come and talk to us, we will listen. There will be some people there that will give you a hard time, but if you speak the truth they will listen also, and you be able to break this horrible fever that has overtaken the red States and put us on a path to disaster.
