The fact that you write, \u201c I\u2019m not even sure, now, whether I\u2019m still alive or not\u201d doesn\u2019t represent death, on the contrary, you show a state of consciousness of life. The feeling of fading away, out of consciousness, doesn\u2019t mean dying. To go to sleep is not dying, yet, sleep is fading away. Sleep regenerates the body and mind. What it\u2019s like to die? To take the time to watch a candle flame extinguish. To hold the hand of a loved one who departs. That is death. It is not fading away. It is the moment in time, a split second, of complete and absolute severance of worlds into a change of worlds. This is irreversible. You are expressing thoughts in words, this is most certainly not death. Out there is a whole world free of drugs. You need not to be a monk or a freak to enjoy a drug free life. It is the natural willpower to not lose control over one's self-awareness and thinking faculties you are born with. Why on earth would you relinquish your Inherent Thinking Faculties for a state of consciousness you have no control over and, moreover, you enhance the destruction of your brain cells? Talking about the walking dead, they are very much alive. The joy of life is found in the small, everyday things, a smile, a hug, walk your children to school, waiting to see them after school, and converse about their day at school. These are precious moments in time to cherish. To include Yoga in a weekly schedule is a gift to yourself that neither money nor drugs can buy.
