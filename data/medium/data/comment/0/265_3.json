I\u2019m a conservative reader who loves using the word \u201csnowflake\u201d to emasculate men who happen to be progressives. It makes me feel tough and manly. I own a gun, bitch!\u00a0\u2026 Ok, I ASPIRE to, so bring it on! Hmmm. What to do today? I know! I\u2019m going to go troll the Ringer to: Tell them that nobody cares about their political opinions, and/or that sports and politics don\u2019t mixThen I\u2019ll turn right around and expose / reverse myself completely by stating that if sports opinions or slants ARE given, they certainly shouldn\u2019t be liberal! And I\u2019ll mention something about how sports and politics are ok to mix so long as it\u2019s Ted Nugent or Dana White making some analogy to survival of the fittest or a league making tons of money and therefore the MARKET does the talking! (TF: we know about markets and that there is an audience for many things. I happen to love NASCAR)I might have, at one time, called Kaepernick an unpatriotic coward for showing a form of protest that didn\u2019t cost my paycheck one single dime, and doesn\u2019t threaten my life or that of my kids in any way\u00a0\u2026 and not notice that the B-2 bomber that flew over Qualcomm at the Charger game cost me at least a buck or two\u200a\u2014\u200aand by the way\u200a\u2014\u200awhat was that air squadron SUPPOSED to be protecting during that flyover?! But who cares because I got a patriotic boner and you know, Toby Keith!!I\u2019ll then insult Bryan Curtis, make some random reference to Joe Buck praise that no one remembers anymore, and, I don\u2019t know\u2026 call him a snob or something?Then I\u2019ll insult The ENTIRE Ringer\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept Bill Simmons, because I\u2019m secretly hoping we still become friends one day (been hoping since the launch of Page 2\u200a\u2014\u200afingers crossed!!) No, I\u2019ll just take a softball jab at Bill, because, you know\u200a\u2014\u200aMailbags! (TF: they do rule, it\u2019s true)Having earned my 14 \u201chearts\u201d from other conservatives who, in the last year, could have formed their own conservative Medium site by now instead, will call out the echo chamber that liberals live in, and curse their educated ways as actually being \u201cmisinformed\u201d and \u201cdevoid of real people\u2019s opinions.\u201d (because we liberals aren\u2019t real! We don\u2019t count\u2026 kind of like military spending doesn\u2019t really count in the Federal budget)I\u2019ll say I\u2019m \u201coutta here,\u201d but return soon to slam another liberal column by the Ringer, absolutely shocked, shocked, despite the fact that the site has never hidden their bias and it\u2019s current writing staff simply calls it the way they see and research it.\u00a0\u2026Write a comment blasting THIS comment, saying \u201cyou don\u2019t understand ________,\u201d or \u201cif you\u2019re so smart, why did you lose the election?\u201d never CONSIDERING that we agree with you and KNOW HRC blew the midwest and took it for granted (you don\u2019t think we\u2019re mad as shit at her?)
