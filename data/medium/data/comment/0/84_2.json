This would have been better as a straight article. But anyway, I agree with the comment that there isn\u2019t really anything that can really be done about resting, and I\u2019m not sure that there should be. The issue is that there are way too many regular season games for a format where the playoffs are the only games that really matter, and then there are way too many playoff games. Resting players is extremely common and accepted in baseball, and that is a sport where most of the players spend most of the game doing nothing but standing around or sitting in the dugout. The risk that a player won\u2019t play is built into the price of the ticket. No one is guarantying that everyone will play. Ticket buyers just need to accept that.
