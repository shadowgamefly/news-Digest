I got married at 19, had two kids by the time I was 23, and then both of them were diagnosed with diabetes. We barely had two nickles to rub together as all our money went to diabetes supplies. Glucose testing supplies for two kids, one of whom was still a toddler, would have been a payment on a very nice car. Then there were the syringes, the swabs, the insulin co-payments. The last straw for me was when the church we attended at the time discreetly told us that we didn\u2019t dress well enough to attend the main mass and that we weren\u2019t giving enough to the church. Atheism didn\u2019t require of me the hypocrisy or the naked contempt that the \u201cChristian\u201d churches did, so I left. Now those same people want to turn the US into a fundamentalist theocracy that has no resemblance to the teachings and acts of the prophet they claim to worship. Quitting the country isn\u2019t an option for me. This time there\u2019s no choice but to actively oppose them with any and all means available to me. I just hope there\u2019s enough of us who don\u2019t want a country that requires of us the hypocrisy or the naked contempt that the \u201cChristian\u201d Right does to rise up and reverse the current slide into bigotry and hatred.
