That\u2019s the way of the world. You are advocating for women to get raped (she says). I guess any woman who goes to work without her husband is just asking for it. Atheism won\u2019t stop it. It is a basic principle of almost all orthodox religions that men need to control women in order to be protected from their charms. Women should submit to their husbands but cover up in front of other men, lest they prove irresistable. Unfortunately Helen, that\u2019s what you\u2019re fighting against, almost as much as you\u2019re trying to gain equality in the minds of men. How many American women voted for Trump? Many said he reminded them of their ex-husbands. Just men being men. I beleive that having an American President who had one African parent has scared the shit our of the White Christian world. All the bigotry, of all sorts, has risen to the surface. It will either be confronted and refuted, or it\u2019s back to the Dark Ages for all of us, and with it the end of a bright, technologically driven future.
