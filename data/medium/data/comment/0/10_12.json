But the fact is, we appreciate that they want to see our city, but they are a major problem\u00a0: too many coaches inside our streets, we can\u2019t access our museums and Grands Magasins anymore, and the worst is\u00a0: they are only here to take pictures of all the monuments, and go off. But we like to meet travellers\u00a0: people curious about local life, that we are always ready to help. We think that the problem is about mass tourism, not Chinese tourists in particular. Anyway, thanks for writing and sharing this amazing story, it changed our view on Chinese tourists\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "576fe93215d6", "timestamp": 1491991014321, "child": "", "username": "WelcomParis"}
