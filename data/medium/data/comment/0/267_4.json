It\u2019s not just the rather bizarre realization that a team as insignificant as the Philadelphia Eagles would actually have 15\u201317 beat writers, but that said writers are trashing the press box so much they have to be ejected like frat boys at an all-night Denny\u2019s. The Philadelphia Eagles own a pedestal all their own, and it is one of annual futility and gritty boneheaded mistakes. It must be such an extraordinary beat-down to be of fan of this team (perhaps second only to Buffalo). I hate the Eagles and have always hated the Eagles since the days of JAWS-worski. But there\u2019s a fine line between love and hate. Their fans (and apparently their writers) are \u201cOld School\u201d legion, as gritty as 1970\u2019s roadies for The Allman Brothers Band. If this team ever wins a Super Bowl, I\u2019m not sure fans would know what to do. Certainly they would be more than a little befuddled, staring into space with the sad realization they have finally lost the tag of \u201cBeautiful Losers.\u201d If there is any justice in the world, this will never happen.
