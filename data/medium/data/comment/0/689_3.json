It\u2019s never about the world as it is, but what it should look like. If what leads us to the creation of robots is the fact that we want them to look like us (both appearance and behaviour), you can't just ask society to embrace \"genderless\" robots. My computer and my washing machine are already genderless. If I want a robot that looks like one of my kind, be it a female companion or a male buddy, I won't be satisfied with one more aseptic machine. What about letting people express their whole range of demands first? You could \u201cface the risk\u201d of it, as it seems to be such an exciting motive. Also, I'm afraid you went a little too far by confusing real, plain objects with a very abstract concept of \"objectification\" that isn't taken as seriously as certain social scientists wanted it to be outside of their political circles. If you're so concerned that human fantasies projected onto robots will influence (negatively, always) the way we treat each other, you shouldn't be considering having any robot of any kind in the future. If female robots are \"objectifying\" female humans, then aren't genderless ones doing the same to the already-marginalized genderless people?\u00a0;) ", "creatorid": "261070a5fdc2", "timestamp": 1491834637452, "child": "", "username": "krefer"}
