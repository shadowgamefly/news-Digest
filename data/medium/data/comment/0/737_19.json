I trust Snopes for most \u201curban legend\u201d issues, but anyone who takes political statements and wants you to take them on authority that their interpretation is proof of something being \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cmostly true\u201d or \u201cmostly false\u201d, or \u201cpants-on-fire\u201d, should be considered more-suspect-than-average, not more\u00a0reliable. A \u201cperfect fact-checker\u201d would be crowdsourced, have fixed editorial standards (certain words or phrasing disallowed\u200a\u2014\u200aexplicitly including casting verdicts). The goal would be not simplifying the evaluation into a single, handy, pre-chosen judgment, but rather fully evaluating the possible interpretations of a given statement and collecting the precise, well-sourced, facts relevant to those interpretations. Truth-values are still ultimately going to come down to interpretation though, in most cases. In any case, I appreciate this article and the spirit of \u201cdetecting fake news\u201d\u2026 I believe it is key to the long-term solution that gets us out of the negative situation we find ourselves in presently.
