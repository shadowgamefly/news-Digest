And I can\u2019t agreed more about solving problem. But I have to two disagreements here: Free (and cheap) information is a big deal. It creates a huge impacts both positively and negatively. I\u2019m not suppose to write on Medium, accept design gigs, and publish on my blog, if there is no free information. Yes, too much free information is confusing, but I think that\u2019s our (the consumer) job to seize what we consume. Besides, all of us (you, me, and Paul) are using free information as a tool of marketing\u200a\u2014\u200ato deliver values, to build brand, and to educate our audience.Labeling social media experts and life coaches with the shade of \u201closer\u201d is just not right. They are also freelancers or solopreneurs. Gary Vaynerchuk does social media and Tony Robbins started with life coaching too\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like there are shitty online marketing gurus and life coaches, there are shitty writers, designers, and freelancers. Solving a problem is the fundamental element of a business but becoming an expert to solve the problem directly is only one of the many business models. Just like how you put it: we don\u2019t need to become an entrepreneur to solve a problem. Some YouTubers solve the problem of boredom by providing entertainment and some podcasters solve the problem of the lack of information by provide access to valuable insights.
