First, who is protesting is just as important to the inquiry of a protest\u2019s efficacy as whether many people are doing it or not. These protestors aren\u2019t a bunch of crunchy granola scarf wearing hipster lefty 20-year olds, they\u2019re people of all ages, backgrounds, and wealth levels. Billionaires, poor folks, black, white, Asian, Latino, left, moderate, educated, vocational, and more. That means the protest isn\u2019t just a demonstration, it\u2019s a movement; that is, it has legs. Second, money. The amount of capital flowing from pockets to INSTITUTIONS that fight for progressive causes has hit record levels over only the past TWO DAYS. This isn\u2019t donating to some screaming liberal who has no plan for governing, it\u2019s money going to some of our oldest traditional institutions designed for advocacy of civil rights. Third, everyone is noticing a pattern. This author is clearly a really smart dude, but he doesn\u2019t see things many important and powerful people don\u2019t. Log onto twitter and you\u2019ll find literally hundreds of \u201cestablishment\u201d liberal types who spend their time talking on CNN panels and directing powerful institutions talking about the pattern that\u2019s emerging. Powerful people are thoroughly aware of what we\u2019re facing, and they\u2019re mobilizing. We are going to win this. Fourth, his plan is incredibly vague and scant on details of what \u2018we should actually be paying attention to\u2019 other than unspecific references to \u2018a greater plan.\u2019 This article is an unnecessary mental burden on an already hyper-aware electorate that is gearing up for the most important civic challenge in generations. We could afford to fight without the peanut gallery. ", "creatorid": "c6bacb80ae96", "timestamp": 1485850760252, "child": "", "username": "neilraina"}
