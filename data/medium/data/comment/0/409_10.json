But the Republican leadership at present works for the fossil fuel interests who finance their election campaigns. I hope that Colorado\u2019s Republican Senator Cory Gardner stands up for the National Renewable Energy Lab and NOAA and NCAR. They do outstanding work and have a massive economic impact, yet are facing brutal, crippling cuts (while already on marginal budgets). If you support RE as a Republican, please make it known to your party. Thank you. ", "creatorid": "d126ffb884bc", "timestamp": 1491578259090, "child": "", "username": "martinvoelker"}
