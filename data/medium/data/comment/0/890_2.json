I think a lot of our anxiety can come from this social pressure. In the end it\u2019s better for our peace of mind to be authentic, but doing so in our ever watching and ever judging world can be difficult. We shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be authentic and it\u2019s a shame that we are, given all the seemingly vacuous reassurances that we are in fact free to be ourselves. Thank you for sharing this Sheila. You write honestly and beautifully. ", "creatorid": "a4c8648ceb43", "timestamp": 1482449038314, "child": "", "username": "santiagodjsantiago"}
