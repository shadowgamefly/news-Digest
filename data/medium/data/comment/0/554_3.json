What you described felt exactly like waking up from my coma. That floating feeling, and being hyperaware of all the sensations around you but not reacting to any of them. There\u2019s a peaceful numbness among all the calamity. I learned then that opioids don\u2019t get rid of the pain, it just makes you be okay with the pain being there, at least in my experience. Reading this was a bit triggering but I weirdly enjoyed it. It\u2019s an extremely unique experience that you worded way better than I could have.
