We should consciously evolve an approach that is less frictional for ourselves\u00a0to\u00a0make\u00a0progress\u00a0consistently. TDD is one such approach.\u00a0However, it is geared more towards writing production code, after we have some structure in mind. Almost all of the content we come across geared towards writing production code. Prototyping is an art by its own right. It is also critical art for every professional developer to master.
