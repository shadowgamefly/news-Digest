How can we make these kinds of changes while preserving freedom of speech, the press and our individual privacy (short list)? Can we remove Big Bucks from the process?How about the Electoral College, not reflecting the popular vote?What can we do to make sure corporate, foreign governments or any other inappropriate influences can\u2019t get an unfair advantage? At least as important: What can be done to insure news stories are truthful and fact based? This seems to be a much too serious example of our technology growing faster than we are evolving ourselves. Many \u201cage old\u201d principles are timeless and should not be pushed aside. Let\u2019s hope that we can learn to do better in the future. Sounds good doesn\u2019t it? Perhaps we need to take a look at some old fashion basics like mutual respect, fair play, honesty, transparency and working more for compromising toward common solutions. While we still can, use the same social media to talk about those common solutions that may be found through interacting for compromise with mutual benefits. There! Problem Solved! So simple, yet so complicated. We always seem to overcomplicate everything don\u2019t we? Your thoughts are greatly appreciate!
