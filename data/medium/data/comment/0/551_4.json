Your writing feels like reading a novel. And thanks for this story\u200a\u2014\u200aas a bisexual woman, I\u2019ve struggled with a similar issue myself. I definitely feel sexually aroused with women but I don\u2019t feel that romantic attraction. Funny thing\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t necessarily get sexually aroused over guys. I\u2019ve wondered if I was a lesbian once. It\u2019s kind of a conflict of interest, really. Hmm. It could do with the fact that I\u2019ve lived under Christian indoctrination for a great period of my life and I\u2019m just programmed to be emotionally attracted to guys, maybe. I don\u2019t even know. But thanks, I don\u2019t feel completely strange anymore. Would love to continue reading more from you!\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "7ab8091677a6", "timestamp": 1492320765752, "child": "", "username": "sallylaurenkim"}
