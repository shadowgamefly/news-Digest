You create the material the reader needs to set up a frame and the specific items/details needed to tell the story. The rest the reader fills in. That\u2019s obvious. What doesn\u2019t seem obvious to some writers who think world building is an end in itself is that too much world building takes away one of the primary joys of reading: the opportunity for reader participation. As Samuel R. Delaney once noted about re-reading an old, beloved SF novel, when a book is in your memory that recording of it is yours\u200a\u2014\u200athe interior of the castle looks like the castle interior YOU came up with. This is one reason I have not gotten through a new fantasy novel in decades. Paragraphs of descriptions of Stuff aren\u2019t why I read fiction. I want to know what she said, what she did, what was going in her head in contrast with what was going on outside it. All the other stuff can be suggested, it can be sketched, or it can be forced on the reader. Delaney also notes that a simple phrase out of Heinlein \u201cThe door irised open\u201d evokes a world without describing it. Maybe it\u2019s an age thing, and readers who grew up with so many visual entertainments like and expect it. Maybe it\u2019s about imagination and originality.
