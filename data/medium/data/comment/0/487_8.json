I am in my mid-forties and thankfully I have survived and remained astonishingly child-free for all of this time. It took me many years to figure out why people did not understand my feelings about not wanting children and questioned me on them regularly. For many people the urge to procreate is primal and beneath language. It\u2019s an urge that can\u2019t be explained away or subject to scrutiny because it is just \u201cthere\u201d and terribly strong. The reason why they tell you that \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind\u201d is because they personally felt neutral or negative about childbearing at one point but then the biological clock kicked in and they got baby-fever. They assume that the same thing will happen to you but the truth is, it just doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. So the next time someone tells you that you might change your mind, just nod knowingly at them. They are projecting. Never forget that people want you to validate their life choices by making the same ones for yourself. Stay strong, sister! This is a temporary issue that quite fortunately diminishes over time.\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "36fb50435f30", "timestamp": 1491589548373, "child": "", "username": "_AuntieToughLove_"}
