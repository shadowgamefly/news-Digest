I generally have a utility function at the top of my test const shallowRender = (props) => shallow(<Component {...props} />); and then just call it in each test passing the exact prop I want to i.e shallowRender({ someProp: 'test' }); I would also have a similar function for mount if needed. I think you could have saved some typing by taking advantage of Jest snapshot, this way you get a nice visual on the rendered output instead of having to write imperative code to query the structure. Great article! Hope to read more like these in the future. ", "creatorid": "47e66b4abc4c", "timestamp": 1487079298173, "child": "", "username": "azizpunjani"}
