They serve as a powerful tool against ISIS recruiting abroad and among those seeing family subjected to sudden, targeted, seemingly nonsensical airport detentions. Ultimately, that helps keep our troops safe overseas and serves our long-term interests as a nation. Please don\u2019t ever underestimate that.
