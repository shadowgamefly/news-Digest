An cause to delay the huge changes needed in how we consume energy. If we want to prevent major changes in the weather patterns of the planet we must act right now. The effects of human pollution to the planet are already being felt. By rising sea levels from melting ice and acidification of the ocean bleaching coral reefs around the globe. There are already measurable changes to the deep cold water ocean currents due to the huge melt of arctic and antarctic ice. Which have major effects on ocean temperature and upwelling nutrients from the deep ocean. These nutrients are the primary food source for zooplankton and phytoplankton.

So if we as humans want to prevent mass extinctions which could include us, the time to act is now. ", "creatorid": "89526fe8d31", "timestamp": 1492136432206, "child": "", "username": "2017hei"}
