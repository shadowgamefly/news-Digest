In fact, one flight attendant told me that they try to put people with mobility devices in business or first class, even if it means upgrading them for free. Apparently it\u2019s easier to deal with in those sections so it\u2019s not selfless. I missed a flight once due to an episode in the airport and even though it was entirely my fault, Delta paid for a hotel and got me on the next flight. I am so sorry that happened to you. That is terrible. I\u2019m hoping that United learns and very real lesson from these last few months. But, I have a feeling that they won\u2019t and they\u2019ll go bankrupt ", "creatorid": "6da8a0c780cb", "timestamp": 1492202085874, "child": "", "username": "katanneweibley"}
