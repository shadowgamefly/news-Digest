I have also ran a G+ site for a few years and decided it was time to step it up. As long as I have breath in me I will help support publications like yours and authors to increase their readership and grow. You will do well as your heart is in the right place. The one thing you have to remember is that this is a marathon, not a race. Take it day by day, and it will grow. I am here to help also. We are all in this together.
