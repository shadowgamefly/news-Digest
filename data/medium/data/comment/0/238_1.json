I work as a data analyst with an IT help desk, and at my location, the technicians only answer emails. We could easily telecommute, and do have one day a week where we can telecommute. The only thing stopping us from having more days or telecommuting full time is an older manager who likes coming into the office and feels being at home is too distracting. However, I\u2019ve talked to many of my co-workers and we all feel being in the office is far more distracting, so your comment \u201cwhere older people in the field have a stronger grip over the culture, and want things to keep working the way they do\u201d is spot-on. Management also uses telecommuting as a tool for power. If a technician doesn\u2019t perform, they\u2019re basically grounded and the privilege is taken away.
