Lets hold off on nominating any new Justices\u2019 to the Supreme Court until the next elections. We need to stone wall anything he attempts to do. I\u2019m ready to move further to the left in my quest to rid this country of a Fashist. What that really means to me is to support his impeachment, meanwhile calling Trump out on anything he does while in office, and limiting him to any win while in office. One thing I don\u2019t want to happen is for the Democrat to work with Trump in his quest to repel and replace the ACA. No thank you\u2026 Trump is a weak President who knows noting about governing. The Democrats need to fillabuster Niel Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, and let the Republicans pull the Nuclear option. No supreme court nomination has ever been filibustered so lets do it. The Republican\u2019s want to play Chicken with the Nuclear Option lets see what they do. ", "creatorid": "b327e73ba4cc", "timestamp": 1490558004429, "child": "", "username": "bsailinman"}
