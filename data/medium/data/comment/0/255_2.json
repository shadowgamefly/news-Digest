You can wallow or you can win. I a span of just a few years I Survived Katrina, My Wife\u2019s Death, Being Laid-Off just 3 months short of a 30 year Career and My Mother\u2019s Death. I selected Option 2. I repaired my house, got a better job, fixed up and sold my Mom\u2019s house and got remarried. My Wife\u2019s and my Mom\u2019s ashes were on my headboard until my new Wife asked me to move them. I would guess that survivers groups are good for those that need them as long as they don\u2019t turn into pity parties or excuses for failure. Regarding \u201cThere was nothing directly in it for him; I just needed help.\u201d Generosity is its own reward, if you understand that you did not convey that message. That he would help you out that way really only shows how he felt about you not really a lot about his character. Who knows maybe he was hoping to get some spin into your story. Now you are pumping his wife\u2019s book and promoting his legacy. Seems like a mutual back scratching exercise or maybe a tight little social circle. What goes around comes around. I hope Sheryl\u2019s efforts do good, no reason to think they won\u2019t and your promotion of the effort is probably genuine. Best of luck.
