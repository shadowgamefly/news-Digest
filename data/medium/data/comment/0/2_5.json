It sounds like United needs to do some airline-wide retraining in customer service. I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t let this completely overshadow the cruise and that you\u2019ll be joining us again next year. Hopefully, by then, whichever airline you fly (I assume it won\u2019t be United!) will have procedures well in hand and you\u2019ll be zipping along the ship without a care in the world. I look forward to seeing you on the boat! ", "creatorid": "5807ee03b62e", "timestamp": 1492143642064, "child": "", "username": "RedPenOfDoom"}
