I love how this is catered towards GraphQL newcomers but also contains a lot of useful material for advanced GraphQL developers. I think another aspect of the community worth mentioning is the amazing meetup and conference culture that evolved over the last 2 years. There are many great GraphQL meetups all over the globe; GraphQL Summit 2016 in San Francisco was the first GraphQL conference ever and it\u2019s been a complete success. Being from Germany, I\u2019m especially excited that we from Graphcool are organizing GraphQL Europe this May, the first GraphQL conference in Europe. With speakers such as Lee Byron, Sashko Stubailo and Tasveer Singh, I\u2019m very much looking forward to the event and connecting with other members of the GraphQL community!
