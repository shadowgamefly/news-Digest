I\u2019m constantly surrounded by younger, more intelligent, faster learning coders (both male and female) and feel a sense of insecurity every day. I thoroughly believe that everyone who feels this way has the capability to push past this and be a well rounded, successful coder! While this does occur I will say this, having women in technology I feel has been incredibly beneficial(and looong overdue) as they often have a much more creative and detail oriented thought process in our every day practices. So I truly hope your message reaches others who are in the debate of going through this process as it is an awesome one! And I wish you the best of luck in bootcamp, we\u2019ve got your back!!!\u00a0:Code On: ", "creatorid": "1c2b256985df", "timestamp": 1491913890040, "child": "", "username": "peters313"}
