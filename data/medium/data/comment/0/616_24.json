I\u2019ve written all my life, for myself, therefore never considered myself a formal \u201cwriter.\u201d Then probably a year or two ago, after some successful writing projects at work, I thought screw it, I\u2019m AM a writer. The best part of the story is that me growing a pair and saying it out loud and proud empowered my best friend to also feel ok about calling herself a writer\u2026you know, after she\u2019d been writing for years including a blog that built up this little community of women dealing with infertility.
