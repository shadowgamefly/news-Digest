I have known about the importance of writing daily, no matter what, for many years, but your post gave me a new perspective to understand why exactly that\u2019s so important. As a single parent, it can be especially hard to commit to writing daily when snow days, sick days, teacher professional development days, and everything else intervenes. But you are right that my son needs to see me work towards my passion, even when that means putting my work and my writing before him. Thanks again.
