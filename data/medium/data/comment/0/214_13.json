I use the Day One app on my phone, iPad and Mac as my personal hybrid Twitter. I open it up several times a day, jot down whatever it is I\u2019m thinking\u200a\u2014 whether it\u2019s three words or sentences or a personal essay, and then close the app. The most awesome thing about the app though is that it doesn\u2019t take a conscious effort to keep a journal. I don\u2019t have to reach for a notebook or a pen. I just have to open the app. And the best about the app is that it shows you a notification of \u201con this day\u2026\u201d and there are all these entries that you\u2019ve made on this particular day in history and you can read them and see how much you\u2019ve changed, or not changed, and just reflect on how much you\u2019ve grown. Journaling is the one habit i am remarkably proud of. And all because of this one app that I once saw was being reviewed by The Verge. PS: no, Day One did not pay me anything to endorse them. I just love their app! Yes, it\u2019s that good. If you are interested in journaling, you should definitely check out the Day One app. Happy journaling!
