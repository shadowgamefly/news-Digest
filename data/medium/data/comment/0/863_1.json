The expansion is motivated more by current spaces and offices unable to house all SEAS faculty, not just non-CS/AM engineering faculty, as well as the current laboratories being much too cramped for even the small amount of engineers at Harvard. But definitely agree with the concern over less interaction between engineering/non-engineering studies as a result of this!
