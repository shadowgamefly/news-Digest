When I went to school at the end of the day i realized, from reading number 3, I think, that I myself decide if my day is good or not. I myself decide if what someone said bothers me or not. I myself decide everything. And yes I can NOT be optimistic about everything but I reminded myself change is good, I\u2019ll get used to it, smile and laugh it off, or give them the EyE!!! (play your spooky music) Think of criticism as someone trying for you to open you curtains or help you up a ladder. Of course they\u2019ll be NO\u2019s and problems, and weakness but when you laugh everything off some of you best friends say your unburnable. Life teaches you things.
