Your question is a really good one, but honestly I don\u2019t have a great answer for you. It\u2019s really very rare that this is done well at companies at this stage. Even companies who have 500 employees frequently are not particularly good with governance around financial metrics. I think that it\u2019s frequently not until IPO (and Sarbanes Oxley) that companies get good at this\u200a\u2014\u200aI know that some companies who have gone through that process have made major overhauls in their financial analytics control processes around this time, focused on being able to audit and version control analytic code. I\u2019d like to see this getting pushed further upstream, with companies doing it sooner, and we\u2019re heavily invested in making version control a core part of the analytic workflow.
