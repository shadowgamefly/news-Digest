If someone uses a hammer to break their arm, yes, you might say \u201cthey did that to get attention!!!\u201d but then it would be followed by \u201cthey really need help, because no one would do that to themselves without having serious problems.\u201d Not so with people who make false claims about sexual assault\u200a\u2014\u200aor who are being accused of doing so\u200a\u2014\u200awho are seen \u201cjust lying\u201d full stop. IMHO it is reflective of the belief that women are fundamentally dishonest, and \u201cout\u201d to trick men. Lying about assault, then, is not problematic and indicative of possible mental issues, but instead is merely some woman \u201cdoing what women do.\u201d Which is ridiculous, of course, but then, so is rape culture as a whole\u2026ridiculous, and dangerous.
