{"name": "16_22", "child": "", "content": "When you used the term \u201clongform\u201d in your intro, I read it as \u201clong hand; picturing the coming content to be written out. I thought, wow, that would be an unexpected expression of design-thinking, something with gravity, sincerity and hard-earned experience behind it. Alas, your slideshare employs type. My mis-read, not your mis-delivery. Perhaps an interesting take on interpretation and expectation. Still, thanks for sharing. I saw you share some other real-world tips at BIG KC in October of 2014, held in an airplane museum/hangar in Kansas City. You set a fine example by being willing to share what you\u2019ve learned, rather than keeping it close to your vest, as some might. Good work.
