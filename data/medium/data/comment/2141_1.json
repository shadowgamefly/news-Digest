It was probably when my doctor suggested, not suggested, told me I was depressed. That was about 40 years ago. I was slow to do anything about it, just continued my drinking for another 15 years, it\u2019s amazing how that can help to keep it buried. No not really amazing. One day I did quit drinking, but being unable to talk in front of a group I didn\u2019t go to AA. Nothing had changed, I just didn\u2019t drink anymore. It took several more years til I was seeing a psychiatrist, who\u2019s specialty was crisis management. After 18 months, once a week it was like a ball a yarn being unwound and wound up again after having a good cleaning. I was of clear mind and able to talk about who I was and where I\u2019d been. Still take anti depressants but I feel good. ", "name": "2141_1", "id": "2e722d7a12ff"}
