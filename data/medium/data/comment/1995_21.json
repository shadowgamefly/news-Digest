I\u2019m really into learning more about dynamic styles, would you mind sharing your sketch file used as example is this post? I would love to see how you created it and how you did some of the styling sharing and sync, let me know if you can send me just a simple copy of it so I can learn from your work too! If you like I would love to join you in a conversation and exchange some thoughts about best ways to create dynamic styles and design elements with sketch. Thanks! By the way, I also wrote an article about Sketch that is being listed on this channel prototypr.io. check the post I wrote if you like: https://medium.com/@caiocall/sketch-missing-features-overview-from-a-designer-perspective-de5b0cbb2da8 ", "creatorid": "3fe2f4fda6f0", "name": "1995_21", "parent": "1995"}
