{"name": "1756_13", "child": "", "content": "Music composition is like any art form, it pays little historically, and it\u2019s role in culture is outsized relative to remuneration. The late 20th century was an outlier in terms of a significant percentage of artist getting paid well. That will never happen again. Now the platforms and genres are so fragmented and the corporate music culture is so closed and incestuous, the only musicians who can make music their dayjobs will either be corporate created or very original AND hard touring. It will be a fraction of all musicians who make real money doing music as their day job. Same as it ever was. And that\u2019s ok. Let the the fight for better royalties continue. But being off the grid is a fast track to obscurity. Even the Beatles catalogue owners figured that out. Time marches on. I\u2019m in the alternative rock genre; those are the songs I compose and publish. I know nothing about Hip Hop. But if I did and loved the genre, I\u2019d consider an artist going off the grid as a dick move and a stupid move. And I\u2019d move on.
