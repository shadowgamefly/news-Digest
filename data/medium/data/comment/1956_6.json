It\u2019s a membership site for writers (with both free and paid versions) where you can post writing for critique in exchange for critiquing other people\u2019s work. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun going over other people\u2019s work and making suggestions for improvement, and it\u2019s been a learning process also, since seeing what other people are tripping up on in their fiction leads to the question of whether I\u2019m doing the same thing without realizing it. That learning got even more intense when I posted my short story, and got some really good critiques back. The people critiquing were positive and encouraging, but they also called me on some bad habits and the occasional lazy bit of writing I was doing. Scribophile probably isn\u2019t the best place to develop an audience, as members are all writers (and aspiring writers) rather than the general reading public, but is sure is a good place to learn to write better.
