Liked that; this, not so much. Now, I will freely, if not happily, admit that I may have not gotten the point, so I shan\u2019t be offended if (when?) you tell me I\u2019m an idiot. That said, idiotic moi experiences this piece as a kind of misfiring satire, in part because it might make a non-depressed person think people with MDD can\u200a\u2014\u200aas a general matter\u200a\u2014\u200aavoid appearing depressed (as in lethargic, etc.) People with, say, dysthymia, might appear like this from time to time, and I will concede that a person with MDD might\u200a\u2014\u200afor a short period of time\u200a\u2014\u200amanage to stave off appearing depressed. But, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible for anyone with some flavor of MDD to act otherwise for any sustained amount of time, e.g., the workday, so I think someone who didn\u2019t get the \u201csatire\u201d might think you were serious, which in turn might create more confusion, about the last thing the depressed need.
