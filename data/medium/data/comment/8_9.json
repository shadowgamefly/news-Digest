{"name": "8_9", "child": "", "content": "Great article, but you\u2019re really willing to wait around 2+ years to see if what Apple delivers is worth using? Why not see what\u2019s out there now, rather than simply hoping Apple might get its mojo back? It might be able to admit it\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s the same company that delivered a major, but tone deaf update to the MBP late last year. I get the faith, but I don\u2019t understand the continued dedication, particularly when the goal posts are so far in the future. I\u2019m a long time Mac user too, but couldn\u2019t hang on words alone and am glad I made the jump to Windows (and powerful hardware) recently. Even if a Mac Pro refresh does arrive, it\u2019s so far in the future I\u2019ll have earnt my money back anyway.\u200a\u2014\u200abut I\u2019m really skeptical Apple can deliver on it (meanwhile, Microsoft has been killing it with products like the Surface Studio by simply listening). Interesting times in the higher end market, but I think the tides are turning. ", "title": "", "parent": "8", "creatorid": "9cca1cc5944f", "id": "86d92ce6871d"}
