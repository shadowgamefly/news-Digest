If there is going to a rule of law, as they say about immigrants, then he has to be removed.Yes, Pence represents the American Taliban, but if there is an impeachment, then it will shatter the Republican Party. The unemployed White guys didn\u2019t vote for Pence. If we can fight through the distractions, cover-ups, wars and lies, and expose Trump, then the unemployed White guys will chase the next \u201csavior\u201d who can show them a way that they can stay alive, stay healthy, a still afford cheap beer. That will probably be the far left. James Thompson just lost his election for Congress in Kansas with 47% of the vote. He lost to a Republican hack, as Ted Cruz came up and campaigned when the Republicans got scared. Last November, the Republican, Pompio, who is now head of the CIA, won that seat with 66% of the vote, so things are changing. Let\u2019s see what happens in Georgia. The whole Trump clan, and all of the Republican democracy destroyers: Ryan, McConnell, the Freedom Caucus, the lunatics in the Cabinet, the Club for Greed, Citizens United, Clarence Thomas, and the mentality that the only thing America stands for is profit through exploitation, all have to be purged from our national culture. Impeaching and convicting Trump is the best way to bring it all out into the open. They will all go down together. It should weaken, if not destroy the Republican majorities, and Pence will be powerless. \u2014\u200a\u2014\u200aOr else we will all have to attend church every morning.
