Such an unbelievable high\u2026a \u201csoulmate\u201d or so I was told we were\u2026and I believed it, wanted it so bad, needed it even. It was true! At least for a time.

Can you both power through it and recognize you are human and make mistakes? Can you forgive the abandonment? The not being there when you depend on them\u2026and they drop you! Can you, recognize they are just as flawed as you? Can you forgive each other when a need just revolts the other\u2026or in my case just being needy, any need. Can you do it repeatedly? Is there a point where\u2026you just loose it? I did\u2026I lost hope and belief\u2026after being hurt too many times.
