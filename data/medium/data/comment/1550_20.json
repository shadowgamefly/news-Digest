One study found that \u201cDemocratic turnout drops by an estimated 8.8 percentage points in general elections when strict photo identification laws are in place,\u201d as opposed to only 3.6 percentage points for Republicans.\u201d I thought this article was going to be about \u201cvoter suppression\u201d, but little did I realize that \u201cvoter suppression\u201d was liberal-speak for \u201copen voting for everybody, including non-citizens\u201d. the very fact that voters (valid voters that is) have 11 months and 27+ days to fix any identification issues that they may have with their state, tells me that alleviating laws requiring voter id isn\u2019t about \u201coppressing\u201d voters, it\u2019s all about allowing those 8.8 percentage points of Democratic votes to continue to be fraudulent votes! I mean, come on, now, seriously, am I the only one that finds it ironic for this article to be written\u200a\u2014\u200aand subsequently posted, on a website that requires the author to sign-in, and requires commenters (such as myself) to sign-in as well, but the article is all about allowing voters to not have to AUTHENTICATE themselves? Should voting be EASIER than writing this article and posting comments on it too?! ", "title": "", "parent": "1550", "creatorid": "22ac3fe4dd5b", "id": "a56386b5e2c"}
