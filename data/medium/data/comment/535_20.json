{"name": "535_20", "child": "", "content": "Do you know Into The Woods? this is so reminiscent of Sondheim lyrics to me: I love love love his sense of word play: Son,\u00a0We\u2019ve no time to sit and ditherWhile her withers wither with her\u200a\u2014\u200aJack\u2019s\u00a0Mother It\u2019s your father\u2019s fault that the curse got placed\u00a0and the place got cursed in the first place.\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Witch Next\u00a0Door And then, of course, there are daddy issues running rampant all over the place: BAKERNo more questions,Please.No more tests.Comes the day you say, \u201cWhat for?\u201dPlease- no more. MYSTERIOUS MANThey disappoint,They disappear,They die but they don\u2019t\u2026 BAKERWhat? MYSTERIOUS MANThey disappointIn turn, I fear.Forgive, though, they won\u2019t\u2026 BAKERNo more riddles.No more jests.No more curses you can\u2019t undo,Left by fathers you never knew.No more\u00a0quests. No more feelings.Time to shut the door.Just- no more. MYSTERIOUS MANRunning away- let\u2019s do it,Free from the ties that bind.No more depairOr burdens to bearOut there in the yonder. Running away- go to it.Where did you have in mind?Have to take care:Unless there\u2019s a \u201cwhere,\u201dYou\u2019ll only be wandering blind.Just more questions.Different kind. Where are we to go?Where are we ever to go? Running away- we\u2019ll do it.Why sit around, resugned?Trouble is, son,The farther you run,The more you feel undefinedFor what you\u2019ve left undoneAnd, nore, what you\u2019ve left\u00a0behind. We disappoint,We leave a mess,We die but we\u00a0don\u2019t\u2026 BAKERWe disappointIn turn, I guess.Forget, though, we won\u2019t\u2026 BOTHLike father, like son. BAKERNo more giantsWaging war.Can\u2019t we just pursue out livesWith out children and our wives?\u2018Till that happy day arrives,How do you ignoreAll the witches,All the curses,All the wolves, all the lies,The false hopes, the goodbyes,The reverses,All the wondering what even worse isStill in store? The 1989 broadway disc of Into The Woods always makes me feel better. Sorry about the off topic but I find Sondheim a brilliant lyricist and so to compare you to him is a huge YAY from me to you. \u2764 ", "title": "", "parent": "535", "creatorid": "9519d329cb15", "id": "ee426f68baa4"}
