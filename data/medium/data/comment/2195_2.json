And I am glad and extremely grateful to you that you pointed out what can be an obviously wrong takeaway from this piece. The kind of caution and mindfulness that you are advocating is an absolute must, especially when it comes to relationships. When I was writing this piece, it was more from an angle of how to deal with day to day interactions as an introvert. It never occurred to me that it can and would apply to our more intimate and meaningful relationships as well, in which context this may be misconstrued. Thanks a ton for pointing it out and adding this absolutely essential addendum. And thanks for being such a wonderful and aware reader!\u00a0:) ", "name": "2195_2", "id": "43981655fe7"}
