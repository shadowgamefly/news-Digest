{"name": "1561_24", "child": "", "content": "This country is becoming a failed institution. It\u2019s a shame that a large enough group of vindictive, hateful people voted into office an equally large enough group of vindictive, hateful politicians who are determined to undermine any semblance of truth, justice, duty, compassion and tolerance by making sure that everyone who is not wealthy in this country dies a painful death so to rid this country of anyone who is not to their liking by denying through punitive policies any chance for citizens to make a better, healthy life for themselves and their families. It will be no surprise to me if Trump\u2019s and Republican\u2019s policies start to look like those of other oppressive regimes across the globe. Hopefully, voters will wise up and those that will be and are being hurt economically will decide to vote these sadists out of office over the next several election cycles.
