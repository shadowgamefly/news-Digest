You touched on many vital points, mental health being an invisible illness, health issues that arise due to mental health issues and mend, don\u2019t repeal Obamacare. Could not agree more. I think most rational people understood that Obamacare was far from perfect when it was signed into law. Many of us were also counting on the House and Senate to improve the bill over time. They crafted much of this bill and they need to continue crafting it to perfection, or close enough to perfection. Thank goodness for Mental Healthcare- this shouldn\u2019t be an issue that is up for grabs no more than any \u2018health\u2019 issue is. If Congress and the Senate mended this bill to perfect it more, they can help to send a strong signal to the public how serious Mental Illness is and just how serious we, the USA are about providing top notch healthcare. It\u2019s time to make positive changes, we should be at the top of the list when it comes to Countries who provide the best of the best! One more note: If they get rid of the preexisting clause, that would affect many people from as young as age 45 on up. Many people have some type of preexisting condition by the time they are over 50. Getting rid of that clause would be a calamity. On a side note: Many people do not have dental insurance because it\u2019s unaffordable if you're a small business or self-employed. And many companies that do offer Dental Insurance have very limited plans which do not cover much more than the basics. Good dental care also goes hand in hand with good health. I would love to see dental insurance added to every plan without increasing the costs by much. Dental care shouldn\u2019t be a luxery or something you have to wait for until you have an issue. Thanks for the wonderful piece! ", "name": "2140_3", "id": "1e26470d916c"}
