{"name": "278_4", "child": "", "content": "Love seeing this! Somewhere on my too-many-lists of ideas i have a stack of problem statements similar to yours. I included content creation myself as nearly everthing out there today still simply models existing ways of learning. I am convinced we can do better than simply replicating lectures as videos for instance. This said, content creation is orthogonal, so i think your focus on just the \u201clearning path\u201d portion of things is the right decision (meh, i know, o\u2019rielly uses that phrase, but it was on my idea list before they started using it in public, so thbbt). Some random thoughts then! Allow for multiple learning styles. Some folk process certain types of concepts in different ways. Allow multiple content types for a given concept (your prototype may have this already?).Focus on how concepts build to make us ready for new concepts.Test this as soon as possible against something that is real-world verifiable. Perhaps a learning path to pass a basic CLEP test? Definitely will be following this project and jumping in to help if i can! Cheers!
