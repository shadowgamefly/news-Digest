{"name": "660_2", "child": "", "content": "Smiling. I have listened to Paglia and Straughn. I find value there. Men are being abused, there is no doubt. Lets do something about it. At the same time, feminism is a thing. It\u2019s not just a label, it\u2019s a connection. Not so much a hive but perhaps a nest. It\u2019s in the female acceptance of one another. Demonstrably, men don\u2019t display this, you guys are individualists despite finding ways to work together. If I were to ask, do your female friends stick together? What would you say? Do they support one another? Do they advocate for each other? Is there a softening towards each other? If you were to say yes to any of these, your friends are part of the collective. They just don\u2019t like to call it feminism. Further, without accepting the collective argument, there is the matter of not starting a better narrative, a useful story that women can adopt. Without more of us saying something about what we see, the hive/nest will become a coven. Only this time the witches will be hunting us\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "660", "creatorid": "32b605cf84cd", "id": "e377519acf1a"}
