If you were one of the aliens, they\u2019d stay around for the sequel\u00a0:-) I takes huge amounts of energy, like two colliding black holes, to make gravity waves that will oscillate matter less than a proton radius. I do like the idea of \u201cswimming.\u201d At low Reynolds number, viscous effects overcome inertial ones. One squeezes through rather than jets. So how about a quantum-gravitation Reynolds number with all the trimmin\u2019s? Entanglement for deliberately transmitting information has been discounted. (And a ship is information.)
