{"name": "545_8", "child": "", "content": "You obviously don\u2019t know how scholarships work, the reason why there are MORE scholarships for minorities is because for years they had not the resources to fund a college education because of the wealth discrepancies. The fact that YOU did not take advantage of it shows ignorance on your part. The majority of scholarships are based and funded by those same minorities who wanted to give back. There are scholarships for housewives, veterans, LGBTQIA, Native Americans, Civic Duty Awards, AARP awards, Music Awards\u00a0, Art Awards, English and Drama/Arts, the list is endless. \u201cSome type of Spanish\u201d tells me that you are grasping at straws to make your argument feasible in respect to not taking advantage of the scholarships available. Did you not know what kind of Spanish you were? Like you don\u2019t know what kind of Asian you are? This is actually becoming pretty funny now.
