{"name": "730_18", "child": "", "content": "Hello! I found your article really compelling. I definitely agree with every point you raised. I graduated two years ago, and as my final project in university I had the opportunity to work on a redesign concept\u200a\u2014\u200ait was for a live brief given to me by Transport for London, so it was very real and gave me my first stint in the design industry. I was getting feedback from the UX director at TfL, he was mentoring me throughout the whole thing. I spent months researching every problem, criticism from users/customers of the interface I was redesigning and was able to solve every problem I highlighted. Your article reminded me of my first \u2018work experience\u2019. I\u2019ve always been taught that graphic design is a \u2018problem-solving\u2019 technique, it isn\u2019t about making things look pretty. It\u2019s saddening that so many people forget that sometimes. ", "title": "", "parent": "730", "creatorid": "6027be3fd6f1", "id": "aa8e8a95bb66"}
