{"name": "1772_9", "child": "", "content": "I didn\u2019t quite grasp what your underlying issue at play is. The main issue as I see it is actually two fold. First you have an older generation of voters raised on Fox News ( GOP tv) and hate radio. And they are mostly in states critical to securing progressive wins long term. Second\u00a0, and more important you have a MSM that values profit and the status quo ($$$) more than accuracy or fair reporting. Hence you get a Bernie Sanders blackout and refusal to cover the great HRC/DNC primary theft. The result is POTUS Trump. Fake news has been around forever. Hell, governments create fake news. Always have. Look at OWS, and what\u2019s happening in Mexico right now after the gas price hikes. Fake news is not the problem. Tribalism is not the problem. The problem is we don\u2019t have a 4th estate. Most Radio is trash. Cable news is not news. It\u2019s trash. All of it. Even the MSNBC of Keith Olbermann does not exist anymore. It\u2019s just Comcast tv by and for Comcast. The NYT and WaPo are nothing but mouthpieces for their respected plutocrats. Most boomers actually believe what MSM spouts. But nature hated a vacuum. This factual alternative media is here already. As the boomers die out, millennials, much more in tune to the fraud that is their government and media, will blow it up for the better through alternative media. Social and otherwise. It\u2019s already started and it can\u2019t be stopped. ", "title": "", "parent": "1772", "creatorid": "1b9e6c62b5a5", "id": "44a3974cb065"}
