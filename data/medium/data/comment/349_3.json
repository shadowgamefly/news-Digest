{"name": "349_3", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for sharing this, it\u2019s quite a well done, vivid piece! Every year on the anniversary of each of my parents\u2019 passing, I write them a letter and share it with the world. I feel like it\u2019s such a great way to honor them and all that they\u2019ve brought to the world. It\u2019s also a great way for me to continue healing and processing everything. I'm grateful for all the warm responses from my close friends, family, and passerbys. Your grandfather sounds like he was very imaginative and having that growing up is something to cherish lifelong in the form of memories. Though memories might fade and become changed over time, writing about them makes them immortal. It\u2019s at the heart of what I enjoy about creative writing. You are lucky to have a grandfather like that! ", "title": "", "parent": "349", "creatorid": "61b755f65e65", "id": "a9d6d4440621"}
