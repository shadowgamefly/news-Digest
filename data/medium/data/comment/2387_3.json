So 70% says that if you intended to get 1M 7 day active users, you got 700k. You may continue to grow, but the 1M was a way to focus attention and energy; next quarter\u2019s OKRs may focus less on user acquisition and instead on improving user experience (measured with an entirely different metric). Back to my essay: you\u2019re not using this (or shouldn\u2019t be using this) as a shared todo list. So the score shouldn\u2019t reflect progress towards a finish line, but instead be a reflection of whether you achieved the full impact you intended or not. Hope that helps. ", "name": "2387_3"}
