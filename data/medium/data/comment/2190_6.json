I am so sorry for your loss Naomi.I know what you must be going through right now, I can feel it in my bones. And I will not ask you to stay strong\u2026because really, that is nothing but a homily. There is nothing like staying strong in times like this. There is just getting through. But what I can promise you, is that maybe it may not look like it right now, but you will get through. It will get better. It always gets better. The pain does not go away, but it fades into a manageable ache. And the pocket of your heart that contains that flicker of happiness slowly expands and takes its place. I also believe that when we lose a parent, we gain a God\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone who sits up there and makes sure we are always looked after. So, it may take some time but the spark will light that fire eventually and you will start living. Hang on and hang tight! I am so glad my piece touched a chord with you. As a writer, I don\u2019t think there is any purpose higher than touching another soul that a creation can serve. So, thank you so much for giving my words a place in your heart. It really means a lot to me!\u00a0:) Stay blessed! ", "name": "2190_6", "id": "2c2457403684"}
