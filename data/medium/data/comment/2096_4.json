The Tarasoff case already has mental health professionals reporting on clients that they think are going to commit violence. And even then, just thinking about comitting violence isnt a crime. The whole issue gets even muddier when you realize that most mass shooters aren\u2019t seeeing a psychiatrist, so any \u201cdiagnosis\u201d (if you can even call it that) would be coming from a persons ex-wife or creeped out coworkers. If a coworker says they think they saw you googling \u201cbest guns for mass shootings\u201d how long of a gun ban should you get? If your ex-girlfrind diagnoses you as \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d how long of a ban should you get? In Florida all it takes to be involuntarily commited to an asylum, is one call to the cops and the phrase \u201cpotential danger to themself or others\u201d. Google Baker Act Abuses. It\u2019s one thing to look back in hindsight and say a person was weird and maybe had some undefinable illness, its quite another to actively take the liberties of people on that same flimsy evidence.
