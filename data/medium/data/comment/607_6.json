This idea is deceptively amazing and most of the negativity here stems from the \u201cmass-producing\u201d part, which you stated you are NOT doing. I liken this to Etsy, and I\u2019d say that this company is even MORE personalized since it touches on a very personal item: photographs. I know I\u2019m really late, but I just wanted to say that not everyone on the Internet hates your idea. I think it\u2019s amazing.
