While providers of these programs (e.g. Udacity or Johns Hopkins on Coursera) will obviously only create compilations of their own courses, this series has the luxury of identifying the best individual courses for each topic regardless of provider. So Data Science A-Z (a recommendation for an intro to data science course) would be just a portion of a data science curriculum. You\u2019ll notice that another top recommendation in this article is actually contained within the DAND: Udacity\u2019s Intro to Data Analysis is a relatively new offering that is part of Udacity\u2019s popular Data Analyst Nanodegree. Since this series is currently incomplete, I\u2019d recommend going with the DAND. It is a great program for preparing for a data analyst role, though relatively expensive\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can read my detailed review here.
