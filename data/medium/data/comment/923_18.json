{"name": "923_18", "child": "", "content": "I can distinctly remember the first time I sat down in front of a Bourne shell, in April of 1980. I was amazed at what I could do with it, and spent over 35 years with it; at first, revelling in it and then, later, automating the crap out of it so I had to do as little as possible in it. I can distinctly remember the first time I sat down in front of Zsh juiced up with omz, in March of 2016. (I had poked at zsh off and on for a couple of months). I was amazed at what I could do with it, and I feel the same sense of \u201cwow\u201d and \u201cwhat can\u2019t I do\u201d that I did with Bourne shell back around June, 1980. Today I solved two problems that had been irritating me for years with how I was using bash, and I wrote a blog post about the overall experience. I just got rid of numerous shell tabs. If only I had a similarly easy, powerful tool to tame my (current 49) open browser tabs. Yes, I know about, and use, Pocket. Its shortfall is that you can only search on one tag at a time. Besides, I\u2019m a command-line geek; I want a bookmark manager I can use and search from the command line, and then open a tab in any browser (Safari, Opera, lynx, OmniWeb, whatever).Anybody know of such?
