{"content": "I\u2019m sorry, but no. I am so tired of seeing this kind of deflection from the real issue, which is a combination of poor choices, both by provider and consumer, coupled with a societal issue that says \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re just a victim here.\u201d No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re no more a victim than my friend Bob, who, at the age of fifty, now realizes he has to correct a lifetime of poor choices if he wants to see age fifty-one. He is morbidly obese and plans his entire day around the next meal, then wonders why it\u2019s so difficult to get up and down stairs. His heart rate jumps just crossing the room. Your \u201cparticipation medal!\u201d attitude would tell him, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, just take the elevator,\u201d when the problem is he should have been taking the stairs all along. No, it\u2019s not just exercise and it\u2019s not just diet, and I get that. But if you\u2019re going to suddenly claim you\u2019re \u201cgenetically pre-disposed\u201d, then I will tell you straight up that if you know the problem, that gives you a starting point to find the solution. If you know you\u2019re \u201cgenetically pre-disposed\u201d to do something not in your best interest, then you find a way of working around that. Otherwise, sorry, you have no one but yourself to blame. Yes, what the bride\u2019s mother said was insensitive. But I\u2019d posit that we didnt hear the whole story\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much self-sabotage did the bride do to herself to miss the mark? Serious weight loss is not for the faint of heart, you know that. It\u2019s going to be difficult and harsh\u200a\u2014\u200abut considering the alternatives, it\u2019s worth making the effort before it freaking kills you. Your choice.
