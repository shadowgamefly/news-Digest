{"name": "1559_1", "child": "", "content": "SIGH*Once again, you misrepresent what the Supreme Court did in Endrew. The 2008 opinion by Gorsuch referenced had nothing to do with the unanimous opinion in Endrew, which is actually focused on an earlier Supreme Court case (Rowley). Rowley, as precedent, is where the language first occurred which limited the scope of what was necessary in the education of the disabled. Rehnquist, in his majority in Rowley, sought to narrowly tailor the decision to limit its impact on school districts. Lower court opinions since Rowley have had to follow that language. That includes the Gorsuch opinion. Endrew now expands on what was written in Rowley, effectively eliminating that language. To put it in the terms you use, it\u2019s Rowley which was effectively overturned and not the lower court opinions bound to respect the precedent. I\u2019m beginning to think your motives in repeating this are impure. ", "title": "", "parent": "1559", "creatorid": "298e93c29fbf", "id": "ed79a61b1c79"}
