Can anyone really blame the Warriors for resting their big four against the Spurs when it was their eighth game in eight cities in thirteen nights (with travel on all five off days)? After all, it was the idiot schedule-makers who forced the Warriors to play five games in seven nights, with a single home game against Boston stuck in the middle necessitating two extra cross-country flights. The only thing the Warriors did wrong was rest their players for the wrong game (they should have rested them for the home game against Boston and saved them the two cross-country flights).
