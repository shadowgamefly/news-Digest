{"name": "1673_6", "child": "", "content": "This is a bit of a sensational title, don\u2019t you think? Cloudflare had a bug. It was a pretty bad one. Within a short time of Tavis at Google finding it, they had mitigated and patched it. The major search engines purged their caches. The questions is whether a bad actor found it and exploited it before Tavis did, or whether the other crawlers out there, now knowing what to look for may use what they have found. As I understand (might be wrong) main leakage happened with unclosed HTML tags. For modern sites that generate HTML probably not a common error. Sure, bad things will likely happen. But consider other exploits and hacks. The billion or so personal records from Yahoo that have been in the wild in bad hands for three or four years now\u00a0\u2026 that\u2019s pretty horrifyingly bad. Insert any of scores of other exploits, known and not and think of those. Now, back to Cloudflare. They are a widely used service whose business is partly about intercepting the bots and DDoS attackers who directly interfere with and attempt to steal and hack our sites every day. Software is hard, and software like theirs is particularly hard. I guess I think maybe this could be presented in a more balanced way. My two cents\u00a0:-) ", "title": "", "parent": "1673", "creatorid": "1fba4038dcff", "id": "2619684d6b03"}
