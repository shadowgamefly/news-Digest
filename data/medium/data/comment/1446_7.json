Burning the candle at both ends and not getting enough sleep ended up taking a toll on my health. Oh the warning signs were there, but I chose to ignore them because all my life I had an endless supply of energy and was able to bounce back. That was until one day when I crashed and burned from Adrenal fatigue\u200a\u2014\u200aI no longer had any reserve. In the process of pursuing success at any cost, I had forgotten to take care of me which ultimately was the most costly. I was forced to put my career and life on hold to finally take care of me which was a slow process. This is one of the most self-sabotaging, damaging things we can do to ourselves and so prevalent in today\u2019s society. Unfortunately sometimes it takes a wake up call to get our attention. It certainly got mine! ", "title": "", "parent": "1446", "creatorid": "e1a616cffc77", "id": "7c7a7830a404"}
