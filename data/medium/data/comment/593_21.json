{"name": "593_21", "child": "", "content": "One of the most significant, yet seemingly unnoticed, smoke and mirror tricks performed by Apple over the last few years, is that the company\u2019s design choices are grounded in a courageous, future proofing paradigm\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly brandished with the new Macbook Pro lineup. With some neat misdirection, one hand gladly shows us how amazingly useful the new machine\u2019s Touchbar is, how great it is to be so much thinner and perhaps above all, the tsunami of benefits that four multifaceted USB C ports will inevitably provide. With the other hand, the influence of Apple\u2019s numbers guys, i.e. Tim\u2019s core team, has found new and innovative ways for the company to save significantly in production costs. Eliminating ports means lowered manufacturing and assembly costs as well as reduced licensing fees and patent royalties. So, by losing HDMI, the SD reader slot, Ethernet and USB 3 and replacing them with four USB C ports (a technology the company is even rumored to have invented/developed and therefore pays little if anything to use), Apple saves a bundle in both hardware and software for each laptop it makes. But what about thinner? Thinner certainly means better? Maybe. But primarily for Apple, thinner means cheaper. At just 10% thinner and with the scale at which Apple produces laptops, it\u2019s not too hard to imagine the production costs on aluminium, packaging weight and shipping costs. I sincerely believe that the only innovations currently available at Apple, are the hidden lessons in how to maximize profits by camouflaging design choices as if they were driven by aesthetics and the love of empowering their customers creativity.
