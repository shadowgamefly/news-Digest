I\u2019ve always been criticized for not embracing the post existential safety rope of humanism. Humanism is a belief system that gives atheist a belief of something better a collective purpose for humanity that if you dedicate yourself towards you will receive absolution in the form of a collective utopia on earth. It\u2019s very judeo-christian ironically. The problem is that when dealing with a tribe of billions, one for all and all for one breaks down. Good intent, good values is not enough. When dealing with uber complicated systems you plan for the worst, not for the best outcome. That is frustrating if you are a 20-something idealist that wants the future now! But that future can backfire really fast if your utopia depends on a billion pieces falling into place perfectly. ", "title": "", "parent": "1768", "creatorid": "5a08f368a034", "id": "dc6e28f063bf"}
