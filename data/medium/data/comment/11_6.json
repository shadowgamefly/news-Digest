With the first class section in my periphery I read: \u201c..if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, \u201cYou sit here in a good place,\u201d while you say to the poor man, \u201cYou stand over there,\u201d or, \u201cSit down at my feet,\u201d have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?\u201d As I looked ahead, I could see that we are guilty of this. United has procedures for choosing who to remove from the plane if there are no volunteers. The order is \u201cin accordance with UA\u2019s boarding priority.\u201d Meaning that if you have a higher fare class, complex itinerary, gold/platinum status, frequent flier, etc. you are less likely to be removed. Unfortunately, being a doctor with patients to see in the morning, isn\u2019t on the list. Have we become so blind as to make everything about the dollar? Regarding discrimination, our nation has a list of protected legal categories: Race, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, disability, veteran status, genetic information. \u201cSocial class\u201d or \u201cincome\u201d are conspicuously absent from the list. Indeed, to include them would shake the very foundations of our economic system. ", "creatorid": "d5d91beb9cd9", "title": "", "parent": "11", "child": "", "name": "11_6"}
