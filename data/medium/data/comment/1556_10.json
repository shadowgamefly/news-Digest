{"name": "1556_10", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m always a little skeptical when I hear about \u201cnon-partisan\u201d coalitions, commissions or anything at all. It seems partisanship is so rampant these days there isn\u2019t anything truly \u201cnon-partisan\u201d any more. How about this: The President nominates a candidate. The Senate has 90 days to hold a vote, or the candidate is deemed approved and is confirmed. The filibuster goes back into effect, so the minority party has at least some say in what happens. Neither party has the ability to \u201cice\u201d the candidate forever; if the party in power doesn\u2019t like the candidate, they have to take positive action to disapprove him, but they DO have that opportunity. Otherwise, the President gets his choice. ", "title": "", "parent": "1556", "creatorid": "2116aeb7ba60", "id": "313850b8e963"}
