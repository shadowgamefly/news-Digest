Hardy\u00a0.I think the main reason why people don\u2019t do in spite of knowing what to do is the fear of failure followed by the fear of ridicule. The first thought that comes is What will happen if I fail\u00a0? And the second thought after that is What will people say\u00a0? I will be ridiculed by all. So my take is this fear of failure can only do by two things.One by talking the help of a great mentor who can advice.Second by taking a data driven decision and making the decision to act as risk free as possible through hard facts.Avoid \u201cgut reaction \u201c decisions.They mostly fail.
