{"name": "1560_6", "child": "", "content": "The Republicans warned Democrats that if they refused an up or down vote they would change the rules. I do not know if Democrats thought Republicans were bluffing or that they really just wanted an excuse to take themselves out of the decision making process so they can claim to have no part in any of it for political reasons. Gorsuch is a mainstream Judge with a Conservative lean, there is no other Judge Trump could nominate that would be more qualified for the job. Letting Democrats get away with blocking this great Justice means Republicans and Trump would never be able to fill a Supreme court vacancy maybe for 8 years if Trump wins a second term. Democrats decided to play the party of \u201cNO\u201d and now they are paying the price. What happens if a Liberal Justice on the court needs to be replaced? Now Republicans will be able to easily insert a radical Right Justice without any participation from Democrats but if those same Democrats had been reasonable now and supported an obviously qualified and mainstream Judge for this seat they would have had some political capital to spend later when the nomination process was more important. As usual, Democrats are short sighted and having temper tantrums. ", "title": "", "parent": "1560", "creatorid": "8f86e30254bf", "id": "8fcfa81376fb"}
