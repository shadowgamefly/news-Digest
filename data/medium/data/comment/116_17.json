{"name": "116_17", "child": "", "content": "Maybe the Celtics and the Rockets will prove me wrong or whatever, but I feel like they could fall in the first round to anyone in the field, and it wouldn\u2019t be shocking. When your best player is a huge defensive liability, things can go south very quickly in the playoffs. The Spurs are only not scary to the Warriors and the Grizzlies (the two teams that fear no one). The Wizards are pretty scary, and my best bet to take the Cavs out before the finals. If you don\u2019t fear the Grizzlies, you\u2019re crazy. I\u2019d put them behind only the Warriors, Cavs and Spurs. ", "title": "", "parent": "116", "creatorid": "eb2591e9c2f4", "id": "360859ed0355"}
