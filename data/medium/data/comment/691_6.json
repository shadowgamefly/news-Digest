Actually it is funny how this reverse strikes here\u200a\u2014\u200aI see that as an indication for how ridicoulus this effect is. Because I think it will not be possible to make work visible with everyone feeling comfortable whilst people do not trust each other. In various aspects. Its always about external comparison. Great system we invented. Harder, faster, higher\u00a0\u2026 and make the most out of you. We have a zeitgeist of over self-improving egoists\u00a0\u2026 and now we realize that this is, well, probably not the best of ideas. Ok, but enough meta: What we startet was kind of a weekly message to the team what we want to focus on this week and a short resume of the week before. Spoiler: It didn\u2019t really work out\u200a\u2014\u200atwo third simply didn\u2019t do it. But to me\u200a\u2014\u200ainitially being skeptic because of the monitoring and control aspect\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a really great tool: I can decide what to focus on and everyone knows that. So they also know what I won\u2019t(!) do or am not focused on. Expectations are so crazy explosive when not met\u200a\u2014\u200aand still people keep them secret or believe whatever THEY expect should be obvious. And by writing down each week a short resume, I also get a list of things that didn\u2019t work\u200a\u2014\u200awhich in itself is not so interesting\u200a\u2014\u200abut also the causes which prevented them. By just reading the plans of someone I could drop them ideas or links or warnings or whatever\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m actually still wondering what prevented most to do that. I\u2019ll go ask them. Maybe it is boring and clear to me what I\u2019m going to do\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah, but it is actually not for me but the others. Or they maybe think, others find they do or aim for to less\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough such a comment never should imply \u201cAnd I will under no circumstances do anything else\u201d.
