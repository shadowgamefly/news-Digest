We\u2019re aware that you guys hate the Constitution when out of power and\u2026well, you still hate it when in power but you at least want the minority to follow it. If you want more power and perhaps the ability to change the governing document you despise so much, elect more people in local and state elections in a broader area of land. Oh that\u2019s right, the country is a massive sea of red for every election except presidential because you don\u2019t want to move away from California and the Northeast.

Hope you enjoy federal judges actually applying the law instead of bowing to the left\u2019s demands and writing laws for the next few decades.
