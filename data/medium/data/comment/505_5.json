{"name": "505_5", "child": "", "content": "Great points and love the strategy conversation. It isn\u2019t done enough! One large issue I see getting in the way of great mission/vision/strategy is that it becomes too precious to get \u2018approved\u2019 by everyone that thinks they should have a say. When it gets written down it needs to be reworded and reworded. It is hard enough to get management in large organizations to make hard decisions that possibly upset half their org (they should strive for this). We are are starting to think about how, as consultants, we can help get something short/small/effective together that helps guide the team without all of this inertia behind creating an org approved strategy. The temp name for this is proto-strategy (a l\u00e1 proto-personas). What do you think? Have you tried a smaller process for this in the past?
