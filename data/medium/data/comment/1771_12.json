{"name": "1771_12", "child": "", "content": "Incidentally it\u2019s kind of a trope in ancient Greek writing that tyrants isolate themselves, living in fear and mistrust of the people they lord it over. That\u2019s supposed to make them the most wretched slaves of all; it\u2019s only in a community where everyone has a say that people are free. Whenever someone mistreats me and I stand up for myself only to be doubly mistreated, well-meaning people tell me that\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t isolate yourself from the bad people. We are all bad people. We bully and threaten those beneath us, accept into our inner circle those who flatter us, and run and hide from everyone else. The only thing we all have in common is this miserly, cowardly suspicion. We built these prisons. We chose this isolation. We teach each other this fear. We are not a nation of citizens; we are tyrants. ", "title": "", "parent": "1771", "creatorid": "c90e201705b4", "id": "c2148cd354f"}
