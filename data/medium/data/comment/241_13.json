{"name": "241_13", "child": "", "content": "I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize how much better players get during the course of their college careers. Most players are just much, much better at 21 or 22 than at 18 or 19. Any player that is good enough to be an average NBA starter for a few years is most likely going to be really good as junior or senior in college. Ty Lawson, for example, was never considered to be one of the best point guards in the NBA (though he had a pretty good stretch from 2011 to 2013) but he flat-out dominated as a junior in college. Add in guys like Danny Green and Wayne Ellington playing as upperclassmen, and that 2009 UNC team was one of the best college teams of the last decade or so even though they didn\u2019t have anyone who turned out to be an NBA star.
