{"content": "Perhaps I over-generalized from what you said, to what I thought you said. but you did say: \u201cToday my impression of feminism is more along the lines of seeing it as an ideology that is dead set on ruining the lives of men while celebrating only the women who support this ideology.\u201d This I feel is inaccurate and provocative, and you offer no evidence. and \u201cHowever, it has been my experience and I have been witness to far more examples of this leadership being one of protection and concern for the well-being of others than one that oppresses and seeks to harm women.\u201d I don\u2019t know where you live, work and play, but perhaps you are better than many at getting men to be concerned about you. And\u00a0: \u201cMen\u2019s violent tendencies are expressed, primarily, on other men. In most cases, a man uses his physical prowess, power and even violent aggression to protect women.\u201d My experiences in working with thousands of people, have left me with a very different impression, but I could see how my experiences would be different than yours. And: I believe women have other powers, that of cunning and manipulation, emotional capacity and their sexuality that they can use to overpower, control, harm and abuse men.\u201d Do you see this as a healthy way of acting, or more of an adaptive remedy to a bad situation? AND \u201cWhile acts of violence occur against women they are not standard or even common.\u201d Again, we see the world differently. And: The threat of physical violence and rape on women appears to be about equal to the threat of emotional violence, emasculation, sexual manipulation and mental abuse targeted at men. Examples of this are the threat of false rape claims, the power to alienate divorced men from their children, the femme fatale who seduces and robs a man of his resources or dignity. I see this as blaming the victim. It\u2019s one step away from saying \u201cshe asked for it.\u201d I could go on, but I think I can see why I said some of the things I said. We clearly have had very different experience and see the world differently. It has been true for centuries that men have used the threat of physical control to get women to \u201cstay in their place.\u201d It continues, to a great extent today. But today, in many ways, men\u2019s roles and power is being undermined because many of the skills necessary to survive and thrive in today\u2019s world are the kinds of skills that more women possess. I have seen this lead to anger towards women and attempts to put them \u201cback in their place.\u201d Perhaps you have not experienced this much. Anyway, if you mean to be provocative, people will get provoked. I hope no major damage was done. I leave you with this old hippy musical tribute to women such as yourself.
