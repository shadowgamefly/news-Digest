{"name": "298_15", "child": "", "content": "Hate is ultimately self-destructive. The ill we wish toward others becomes our conception of how others regard ourselves. This holds true for every sin. The theif worries that someone will take his stuff; the liar cannot trust other people, much less himself. The cheater in marriage is filled with jealousy. We exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to others because we believe we are gods; yet we know, at least subconsciously, that this isn\u2019t true. This divide tears us apart inside, for no one can serve two masters and the kingdom divided against itself will fall apart. This is why we intuitively recognize the validity of the Golden Rule- \u201cDo unto others what you would have them do unto you.\u201d Is there help for those of us whose earlier way of life shame us, and/or who still struggle with these untimately self-destructive behaviours? Christians believe that the divine Son of God (who pointed out the Golden Rule, incidentally) has suffered destruction in our place, and empowers us for lives of integrity and good will toward others.
