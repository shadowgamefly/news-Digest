I thought he had to grow up, but he proved me wrong. He was always to dominant for a child and too irrational for a grown-up. And he still is. PED speculations aside\u200a\u2014\u200aI think he deserves the trophy, although Harden, who was on the bad end of the \u201cwinning equals MVP\u201d-equation versus Steph, might end up winning but still being on the bad end of the \u201ctriple doubles equal MVP\u201d-equation this year. Beard luck. Still, for years now I have been thinking how it would be to see Westbrook in the flesh, from courtside. There has simply been no other player that embodies \u201cyou have to see it to believe it\u201d more than Russ does. ", "title": "", "parent": "33", "creatorid": "6dcfc1dbb2fa", "id": "cdb92714725"}
