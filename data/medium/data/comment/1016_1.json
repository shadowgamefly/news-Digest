{"name": "1016_1", "child": "", "content": "Totally agree. My teams have moved away from wire framing in the traditional sense and instead stick to white boarding to keep fidelity low to start with and then incorporate flow details and paths in our hi fidelity Sketch docs so we have single design files. Also makes it easier to keep updated over time rather than 2 files that can get out of sync. We typically don\u2019t do specs as some of our engineers use Sketch to pull out what they need and others use Zeplin. If something in particular is worth calling out for a screen or flow between screens we add that below the related art board or as a comment in Zeplin. And as much as possible rely on direct communication/ conversation with our dev partners. And as several others mentioned, prototyping is highly valuable for anything with complexities.
