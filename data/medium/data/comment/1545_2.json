{"name": "1545_2", "child": "", "content": "Oh please, you liberals have been beating that dead horse now for years. ANYONE that wants and ID can get one, they\u2019re provided an either no cost or a nominal charge but you would have to agree certainly worth the cost and effort if you want to vote, right? IDs have been required for most all transactions in the US now for decades. Try to cash a check, buy beer, buy tobacco products, get into any Federal Building, buy a plane ticket, claim the winnings on a lottery ticket, rent a car or use your insurance card at the doctors office or hospital without a photo ID. You cannot do any of those things without a photo ID. This begs the question, why are the liberals pushing so hard for voters to be allowed to vote without an ID? The only logical answer is that they want to make sure that people that aren\u2019t eligible to vote get to. ", "title": "", "parent": "1545", "creatorid": "26d1f3222cf", "id": "96d4b65b68e5"}
