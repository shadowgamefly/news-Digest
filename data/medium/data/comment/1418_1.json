Sounds like you aren\u2019t quite clear on the concept of \u201corganic\u201d and also, judging by the tone of this ridiculous article, and the titles and content of the rest of your \u201cwriting\u201d on here, you are in bed somehow or the other with the huge agriculture and/or petrochemical industries.

Do you really feel that introducing more chemicals and franken-plants into our shared world is a good thing? Next time, before you spout off this crap, take a long hard look at those kids you claim to be educating, and think about the amount of chemicals each of them eat, breath, perhaps absorb through their skin working on some farm, and ask yourself if you support that. I\u2019d hope you wouldn\u2019t. ", "title": "", "parent": "1418", "creatorid": "2daa7870a0bb", "id": "7669ebbd0d28"}
