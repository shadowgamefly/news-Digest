Choose ideas that are unique\u2026and challenging. A bit of familiarity is useful for connecting with your audience, but if you aren\u2019t stretching yourself and stretching your audience, then you may be an entertainer which is also noble, but you aren\u2019t an artist. Choose ideas that you can\u2019t explain. As an artist you want ideas that are rich in possibility that draw you into finding a greater inter-connectedness among people, ideas, and the circumstances of life. You want to bring just enough order to life to help enlighten, while leaving enough chaos to open people up to the wisdom of accepting that life is messy. I create independent theatre and have to take on many creative roles myself just to make my plays happen. As such I can never simply describe my work: that\u2019s the job of a marketing specialist who knows how to trim my creative output down to titillating details that are suggestive of what my event will feel like.
