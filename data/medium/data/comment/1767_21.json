There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d to never feel offended by words. \u201cHate\u201d speech which is checked in all venues, is that which incites violence against one or more others; and yet it\u2019s allowed from 1 side of the spectrum freely, while banned on the other, or at best impeded! WHO becomes the arbiter of what is or isn\u2019t acceptable speech? ONLY God Himself has that right; and He\u2019s not sitting at a computer scanning e-mails, blogs, etc. Either laws are applied EQUALLY to all or there is no law and order for any.
