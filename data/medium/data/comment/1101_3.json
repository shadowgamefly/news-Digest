Yes, if he lives through this, I\u2019m certain Trump will end up before an international tribunal for advocating blockage of the Paris Accord. But other than that he is a just a sleazy con artist with the benefit of huge family money. But, you are correct, Pence leads the truly, viciously, sick remnants of the twisted religious heritage of the failed American experiment in racist democracy. I don\u2019t think Trump will last long as he too simple minded to avoid massive corruption and being tricked into incredibly stupid moves for lack of any plan. He just showed us yet another example of that. But I am leaning more and more toward keeping Trump around and until we can remove the whole crew but that will take making major changes to the failing system. I\u2019m afraid Trump is too stupid to actually bring the system down. Now that is a twisted thought\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.
