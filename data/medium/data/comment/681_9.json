{"name": "681_9", "child": "", "content": "\u201cthe form of art that you are attracted to is often a reflection of an imbalance within you\u201d How true. I was smirking while you described yourself as being in a constant state of motion, challenged by plans, projections and patience, because I see myself as the opposite side of the coin. By contrast I am a planner, organizer, and have no qualms spending hours tweaking a minor detail. Historically, I work in pencil drawings and essays. With graphite, you need only worry about the highlights and shadows of one color. You can focus on the lines and technique, solely produced by your hand. No worry about how two colors will play together, or if you will be able to create this shade. And essays, where you can expand a point for as long as you want and then return later to edit it down. Create pages and then decide you will wait a few days to determine whether it\u2019s something you really want to share. I think that is why I am so strongly drawn to painting and poems. I\u2019m no expert (or even an amateur), but it seems you need to have more trust in your materials and resources. Sure you can agonize over gathering your paints, but once you start your paint will dry. You can paint over it, but you can\u2019t erase it. Similarly, you can examine a [short] poem for as long as you please, but there are only so many pieces. You start tweaking and the whole meaning may change, unlike an essay (though you could certainly get there\u2026) All of this to say, maybe the same attraction we have for art reflecting our internal imbalances is showing us the type of people who can balance us. You\u2019ll never know if nobody else does. ", "title": "", "parent": "681", "creatorid": "8a1bc4d1172c", "id": "dfd5071f9693"}
