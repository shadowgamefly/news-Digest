{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "fd026d59a98e", "content": "Great analysis of Pau Gasol & Deron Williams being 2 guys traded at the height of their value and thereby receiving the most in return. The Pau trade gets sh*tted on because the Lakers received an immediate return while for the Grizzles it paved the way, for their Grit & Grind team. Plus anytime Kwame Brown is a part of the trade headline, it\u2019s going to lead to ridicule. Paul George & Jimmy Butler probably won\u2019t be anymore valuable than they are now. Carmelo Anthony\u2019s value has already plateaued and continues to fall by the season. ", "creatorid": "7c3f6993de0e", "name": "1925_8", "parent": "1925"}
