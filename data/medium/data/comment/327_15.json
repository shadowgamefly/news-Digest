{"name": "327_15", "child": "", "content": "I am really curious about the photo choice for this piece. The essay is an honest, important look at the difference of accepting failure as a potential outcome versus risk avoidance as a means to protect against the severe societal judgment of failure. As entrepreneurs, we\u2019re talking painful failure with painful, real consequences\u200a\u2014\u200alost jobs, lost wealth, lost time, among others. So it feels incongruent, at least to me, that the essay\u2019s image is of a woman crying over herdropped, melting ice cream cone. I like ice cream, but I like my team being able to pay their bills and keep their home a whole lot more. Dropping that cone is a bummer. Failing at a startup is a whole lot more than just a bummer. I, for one, eschew some of the new mantras that gloss over the consequences of failure and almost celebrate it, because I think it sends the wrong message about just how high of a personal and financial price there may be to succeed. However, I do agree that as a society, we have to understand that risk brings with it a higher potential for failure\u200a\u2014\u200aand we need to provide better access to resources like mentoring, training, and capital that increase the opportunities for success. But, to be honest, until we change the way we teach our children, until we, as a society, teach our children to value curiosity and discovery above the ability to memorize correct answers, until we give our youth the freedom to try and fail and take those lessons to try something else? We likely won\u2019t be raising new generations who view failure any differently than we do today. ", "title": "", "parent": "327", "creatorid": "36f4e6025444", "id": "26eb4c586ebb"}
