{"name": "1559_14", "child": "", "content": "It would be great to live in a world where there were honest descriptions in regards to positions on issues. Where each side would honestly state the position of the other when discussing why their side is correct. When you don\u2019t you make your own arguments seem weaker because you are essentially not even debating the other side. That is essentially what is being done here. Nobody is trying to stop people from voting. They are trying to minimize voter fraud. Arguments could be made on the optimal amount of security versus convenience for voters. None of us want American Idol or NBA all star type voting though. On the gerrymandering accusation. People do not organize themselves into easily defined areas. Each legislative seat that isn\u2019t on a state wide basis has a district carved out by population number. There is no clean way to do that. How happens in practice is both parties negotiate districts and the connected few of each party generally get \u201csafe seats\u201d. It is distasteful, but it doesn\u2019t really provide one party an advantage over another. Complaining about it is one of those things that people can always do generally, but rarely make much sense other than sour grapes. In this case who is to say that the districts drawn up by some judge or judicial panel are right and the ones by people elected to office are wrong? Both are pretty arbitrary.
