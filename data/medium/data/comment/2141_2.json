I\u2019m glad your daughter was able to talk to you and she made a choice to leave. It\u2019s vital that employers create a healthy atmosphere and a trusting one as well. Employees can\u2019t grow and they don\u2019t even know who to turn to if the atmosphere is one of distrust. Thanks for your wonderful comment and sharing your daughter\u2019s story!
