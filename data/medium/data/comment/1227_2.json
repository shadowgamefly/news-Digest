Making forgiveness a priority.Self-reliance given a proper boundary.Knowing what is, and what is not happening.Going through the bliss so that you break again. Waiting. I know not where this road leads.It is truly mysterious, and wondrous.Focus on vulnerability, compassion, loveguide my desire.If connection is happening,then let it come, and not hold back.
