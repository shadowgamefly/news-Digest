{"name": "601_14", "child": "", "content": "Good on you! Strange parallels and congruencies in your story with my own experience of being kicked out of the company I founded after 18 years. In my case, because I delegated investor management to my partner, who built his own bridges with the investors/board while I let mine crumble. In my defence, our investors were idiots who were wrangling amongst themselves. But that\u2019s a poor defense, I know. But\u2026 it\u2019s the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to my career. It\u2019s been six years now and I\u2019ve partnered with the person I should\u2019ve originally\u200a\u2014\u200amy wife. We\u2019ve built a business up from scratch leveraging each other\u2019s skills and it\u2019s more successful and way less stressful than the original was. I\u2019m back to having fun and running a business because I want to and not because I have to. Power to you! ", "title": "", "parent": "601", "creatorid": "16e7a7a05559", "id": "85b3639a1de9"}
