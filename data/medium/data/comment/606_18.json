{"name": "606_18", "child": "", "content": "Mate\u2026 I\u2019m a developer too. Not a games dev but a dev none the less. Before that I was an Infrastructure Architect\u2026 a really good one with huge clients and a lot of respect. I stopped doing that to start at ground zero cutting code because as an Infrastructure guy I always had better implementation ideas. It\u2019s a lot like what you\u2019re describing, I was burnt out on it all. What you are describing is typical of anyone who rapidly moves through the heirarchy of any career anywhere. And someone who is passionate about it and invests everything about themselves to it. Imagine how the acclaimed Brain Surgen feels when he has to do YET ANOTHER operation. You\u2019re not alone\u2026 I\u2019m a tiny independent dev now and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Go with your dreams and do what you enjoy. Congratulations.
