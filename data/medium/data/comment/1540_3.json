Yours and hisuse of the term \u2018massive\u201d proves the unseriousness of both his claims and yours. \u201cMassive\u201d is not a legal term used in court. Only in politics, There was likely a lot of voter fraud, and Trump knows he can\u2019t prove it. Still by a wide margin more people believe him than will believe you. Sort of like buildig the Wall and amping up ICE enforcement reducing illlegation crossing to a trickle, voter fraud on a large scale will simply disappear and those in the watch-dog business (I know several in swing states) will know it without having the quantify it. The difference between 3% voter fraud and 2.3% voter fraud cost Hilary the election, partly because Trump\u2019s message stole a lot of votes in places I\u2019ll leave it for you to find, and in part because the Hillary camp wasn\u2019t minding the store. Purely from your persepctive and what ypu at Think Progress hope to schiev it must be disheartening to be correct every once in awhile yet have no one to shout it to, no one to bring over to your side, because for years you have surrounded yourselves with an army of mind-numbed witless fans who are not able to discern the fact from fiction. You made that bed. not Donald Trump. If you want to find a higher quality readership you might start by cleaning up yur language and you act. Progressive don\u2019t have to lie, you know.
