{"name": "869_6", "child": "", "content": "There was so much sickening about that commercial, yet it was sadly true too. One of the things that struck me was the fact that you had all of these people who clearly had no idea what they were actually protesting. People joining the protest with no idea what was being protested. Sadly, I think that is too common. I think that was the woman\u2019s march on Washington. I think that was a lot of the feel the Bern crowd. I even think that is a lot of the people who protest cultural and racial issues only because they think they \u201cshould\u201d be protesting them. Anymore, people\u2019s sincerity often ranks right up there with Pepsi\u2019s very rank apology. I think that the apology you give them is too kind. Ignore the people randomly dancing in protest to who on earth knows what (and to those out there who have said it wasn\u2019t \u2018that kind of protest\u2019\u00a0\u2026 it ended by marching up to a police barricade. It was \u2018that kind\u2019 of protest). If you look only at the meat on this plate you have a female Muslim photographer working with some degree of intensity on a project that seems to be serious in nature. You have a blonde model (I could go on for days on the fact that Jenner as a model starts out in a blonde wig, or on the fact that if you notice, it is a black woman fixing becky\u2019s good hair on her photo shoot) taking off her wig to join in this little dance protest. It all boils down to the Muslim photographer suddenly happy snapping pictures of this fairly bland icon of Western beauty as she makes her way through the protest to offer the police barricade refreshment\u2026 Really, I don\u2019t know what all the rioting and protests are about. Come on. They\u2019re just thirsty. Give those boys a Pepsi and it\u2019ll all be good. Jesus. Or as they say around here Bless.
