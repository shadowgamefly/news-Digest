I know that you\u2019re writing for your own development, but could I just recommend one thing in your posts? It\u2019s not even about your writing. I think your posts could use some stock images at the top to go with it. You can find many sites to get these stock images that may or may not associate with your post\u200a\u2014\u200abut they definitely make them look better. I use unsplash.com I only suggest this because it would make your posts look better. ", "title": "", "parent": "513", "creatorid": "f78dd7713cff", "id": "12a95598d16a"}
