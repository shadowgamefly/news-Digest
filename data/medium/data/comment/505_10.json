{"name": "505_10", "child": "", "content": "I love the idea of a proto-strategy! I haven\u2019t necessarily tried a \u201csmaller process\u201d in the past, but I think it makes perfect sense and I can very much empathize with the circumstance. I think the main underlying point that a \u201cproto-strategy\u201d really gets across is this: whatever strategy you have is a hypothesis. As soon as that is understood, people tend to not treat it with such preciousness. Through that lens, it\u2019s easy to see that rewording and editing a hypothesis is huge waste of time.\u00a0:) There are three things I think is also relevant here: In my experience, the best strategies are the ones that, once articulated, most people respond with \u201cwow, why aren\u2019t we already doing this\u2026?\u201d Which is to say they are usually non-obvious ideas that seem obvious in retrospect (that\u2019s how good they are). Being able to strike this here tends to make buy-in a bit easier.Strategy, just like any good hypothesis, is an educated guess. That guess is typically accompanied by either intuition, data, or both. If there is data, then presenting the data is the best way to get buy-in on a strategy.If no data is available, the \u201cAgile\u201d approach should be to try it fast, gather data, then validate/invalidate and continue to iterate as necessary. That doesn\u2019t address one of the bigger human problems in strategy development, which I think is what you are alluding to: everyone wants to be (or thinks they are) strategic. Everyone wants to be part of the strategic conversation because they think they need to be (sometimes for political/power reasons). Especially as a consulting firm, I\u2019m sure you run into a lot of \u201cnot invented here\u201d mentality as well. The best approach in those situation may actually be staying away from the word \u201cstrategy\u201d altogether (proto- or otherwise) as there is a ton of baggage and emotional triggers associated with it. The other approach may be to simply have the discussion to make folks feel like they came up with the idea themselves\u200a\u2014\u200aalways an effective upward management strategy.\u00a0:) Would love to hear what you think!
