{"name": "545_3", "child": "", "content": "Okay, okay..gloat away\u2026you did call it\u2026sigh..I had to learn, right? I went through that person\u2019s account, looking for tell tale signs\u2026there were several, different historical references out of place, like they thought Mothers Day had been passed by, when we hadn\u2019t even celebrated it yet, I suspect they aren\u2019t even from here in the states, I just couldn\u2019t believe someone would be THAT OBTUSE?!? Another clue was they had identified themselves as Spanish. Most people identify as Brazilian, Argentinian, those from Spain don\u2019t say Spanish, they would say Castilian or another part of the country. And then they complained that nobody is giving them anything for being Spanish? They were obviously referring to scholarships, which one knows you just don\u2019t get those unless you have a high grade point average, in addition to civic work..their story didn\u2019t add up. They kept blaming everything wrong in their life to the \u201c ghetto\u201d\u2026honestly, that term in itself is outdated. It was a very strange interaction to say the least. They couldn\u2019t really back up their argument. Where I asked for solutions\u00a0, there was no reply. I thought that maybe it was a bot, where I said certain words, a reply was kicked back. Oh well\u2026I will listen next time Caleb. It does help my writing, though, being clear and concise with dissecting ridiculous rhetoric such as theirs.
