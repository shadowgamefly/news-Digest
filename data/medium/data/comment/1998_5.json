You could use BEM to share styles between components, but then your styles would be defined outside of the component that is using them. This makes maintaining everything a bit more complicated. Vue also gives us the ability to make use of scoped slots which makes things like BEM less useful. We\u2019re able to use the same class in multiple components without styles conflicting. Two different ways of accomplishing something, both have their pros and cons. You\u2019re definitely not missing anything, it is a bit of over-engineering if we\u2019re just considering the context of the article. If you consider the concepts explained applied to a larger app, things don\u2019t seem so over-engineered. That\u2019s just my opinion though.
