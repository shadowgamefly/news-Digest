{"name": "592_6", "child": "", "content": "They\u2019ll probably go for the minimum viable product: have a built-in watch face that can also display text and/or bitmaps sent over bluetooth, and can send accelerometer data and button presses to the phone. So maybe there won\u2019t be a need for updates, as long as the feature set is light, there aren\u2019t any bugs and the bluetooth protocol doesn\u2019t change. Instead of apps that run on the watch, you\u2019ll have phone apps that use the watch as a remote display. It won\u2019t be the first time that there was an oversimplified bluetooth watch; there used to be some that could only display a few characters on an LCD, just for caller ID. But they should\u2019ve rather bought Pebble before Fitbit did. At least the whole ecosystem was already set up and had ardent followers; they would only have needed to keep it alive, put their name on it, start cranking out improved models every year or two, and have an assortment of flashy plastic cases like they\u2019ve always done.
