While this has not been a major area of personal study, for quite some time I\u2019ve been interested in online interaction and the ultimate creation of online communities that grow out of that interaction. My own personal experience dates back to 1983 with the formation of the National University Teleconference Network (NUTN http://nutn.org/) in the United States. In addition to face-to-face meetings and lengthy conference calls, we made use of computer conferencing. It was a significant factor in helping those involved, scattered at colleges and universities across the country, become a Tribe. Zoom forward to 2016 and I\u2019m now part of the TEDx community as a licensee of TEDxLincoln (that\u2019s in Nebraska USA). We have connected with one another through an online tool that the TEDx office created called the TEDxHub. It\u2019s helped TEDx curators scattered in some 170 countries around the world become a Tribe, and I think that deep and vibrant culture has contributed to the success of thousands of TEDx events and to the phenomenal growth of the TEDx movement world wide. Indeed, one of the TEDx curators, David Troy (he is the licensee of TEDxMidAtlantic in Baltimore/Washington) has done his own study of online interaction within defined geographic communities. His findings were shared on the TED stage in 2014. https://www.ted.com/talks/dave_troy_social_maps_that_reveal_a_city_s_intersections_and_separations?language=en Thanks for doing this analysis and for sharing it on Medium.
