{"name": "1772_2", "child": "", "content": "Some good points. I am troubled by the focus on Fake News, to say nothing of the focus on the \u201cRussian Hacks\u201d. For many of us the news was always a murky matter, especially when it was controlled by corporations. Follow the money, indeed, but even that\u2019s not easy. That liberals (center-left people) are now focusing on just the outright fake stories is troubling. It means they won\u2019t focus on the subtle bias or the other ways in which consent is manufactured. A couple years back I wrote about how to read the news, a non-trivial problem then and still a non-trivial problem. My specific path travels along the Iraq war and how I served there. But it makes me much more alert to the fact that there are still big issues out there. As I\u2019ve said before. We\u2019re all apes, stay vigilant.
