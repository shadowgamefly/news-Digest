No popular library at the time offered either. The various libs and frameworks you listed only picked up React\u2019s features after React popularized the patterns. Regarding the inference that React merely became popular because it\u2019s from Facebook: Keep in mind, Facebook\u2019s open source wasn\u2019t broadly respected before React. In fact, most people mocked React in the early days - people saw putting HTML in JS as *gasp* mixing concerns.\u00a0:) React was Facebook\u2019s first big open source hit, but far from their first try at open source. Much like Google, a big name\u00a0!= success. Good ideas spread. And yes, good ideas from big names spread faster. Considering React is not the fastest, nor the lightest, nor the easiest lib/framework to configure and use, a better question would be: why is it that we see so many people jumping into React when there are objectively equally good or even better options out there? Better in some ways, but lesser in others. Community, company backing, ecosystem, stability, documentation, and training are all areas that React excels. The many attractive alternatives may mature to fill in these gaps, but they have a lot of ground to cover. ", "name": "2400_21"}
