{"name": "425_13", "child": "", "content": "The other problem is that the true cost of hotels and airlines are now \u201cbelow the line\u201d. So you can\u2019t price compare. For hotels, they tack on their compulsory \u201cresort fees\u201d. But that fee isn\u2019t part of the price advertised. Plus they charge extra for parking. Extra for internet. Plus local hotel/bed taxes that some cities charge. For airlines, it is luggage fees. Seat fees. Everything fees. The travel search engines need to get smarter. I should be able to tell my search engine what my needs are, and then have it compute the real out of pocket cost. I want to say \u201cI need to park my car, and I need decent internet fast enough to watch Netflix with\u201d. Then let it figure out the best deal. For example. If I need a hotel near a venue. But a hotel just outside of the city limit doesn\u2019t have to charge me a $10 per night bed tax assessed by the city, then that can make a huge difference. It may be worth the cost to stay at that hotel. If and when the travel sites can do this better job, is when they will get their customers back.
