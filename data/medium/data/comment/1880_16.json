{"name": "1880_16", "child": "", "content": "We met a year and a half ago in Berlin, if you recall, and in the little time we spent you were candid, humble and a great listener. I was going through a lot of bad things at the time, and the little talks we had during DNX's event and party were of great comfort. You're a great person, and everyone who knows you will probably agree that we all want to see you succeed, on anything you do. But I would be lying if I didn't say it's sad to see you go from such a great company. Buffer wouldn\u2019t be what it is today if it wasn\u2019t for your guidance and vision. I know I wouldn't be a paid Buffer user if it wasn't for some of the things you did. Either way, I can't be that sad for you or for Buffer because I know if you are able to do half of what you did there on your next venture, you will do great (although I know you will do even better). Best of luck on what\u2019s to come! ", "title": "", "parent": "1880", "creatorid": "e30e70c74dd5", "id": "9d41875498ed"}
