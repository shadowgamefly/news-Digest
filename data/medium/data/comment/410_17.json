{"name": "410_17", "child": "", "content": "I believe it first appeared in a book called \u201cParkinson\u2019s Law or the Pursuit of Progress\u201d by C. Northcote Parkinson (Author), O. Lancaster (Illustrator)(ISBN: 071951049X) And indeed, it was not an academic paper, but rather a collection of satirical writings and Illustrations. I do believe Parkinson was making a serious argument and simply chose satire as the best way to express it. But, calling it an \u201cacademic theory\u201d is probably not appropriate, since the term implies a level of rigour in the development and publishing of this argument that is likely far beyond the scope of a satirical book. I will revise the post to reflect this new information. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. ", "title": "", "parent": "410", "creatorid": "7f9c91ba25fb", "id": "e54622754bde"}
