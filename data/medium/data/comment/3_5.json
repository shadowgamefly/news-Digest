That\u2019s why you only see NY City likened to places like LA. Which is probably why everyone discounted Trump as a sure loss in the election. These are considered fly-over states full of hillbillies with backwoods education to someone from one of the coasts. Of course we are not going to be compared to NY or LA, San Fran, Seattle, Silicon Valley, etc\u2026 at least not by someone from one of those places. They are soooo much more civilized\u2026 Talk about distance! Example: Illinois politics and lawmaking revolves around Chicago -> largest area of people, even though the state is huge, and some of the laws they make work against most of the rest of the state\u2019s business (IE Agriculture, Ag Machinery manufacturing, etc\u2026) The laws are drawn up to benefit the most populous cities\u2026 Now take this a step further -> if NY and LA are not even thinking about Chicago, Detroit, etc\u2026 why would they even consider smaller \u201cmetro\u201d areas, like say where I\u2019m from (Quad Cities, USA\u200a\u2014\u200aDavenport IA) The unexpected find for this would be that they actually did a study!\u00a0:)\u200a\u2014\u200athis post is full of sarcasm\u200a\u2014\u200aand represents my own views, not the views of the company that I work for.
