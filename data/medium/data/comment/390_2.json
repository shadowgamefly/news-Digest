{"name": "390_2", "child": "", "content": "Hola, Cesar. I\u2019m the editorial director of the NYT en Espa\u00f1ol. We take criticism of our translations very seriously. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re constantly trying to improve and reader feedback is crucial. Sorry if these translations didn\u2019t mean your expectations. Sometimes, with the fast pace of news, rigid sentences and literal phrases get past us. When I say us I mean the humans translating, editing, curating and writing for nytimes.com/es. We use two filters of editing and copy-editing for each translation \u2013 not algorithms. The team has journalists from Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, based in Mexico City. We also produce original stories and opinion columns. We will keep working to improve the translations\u200a\u2014\u200aour goal is to keep presenting the best Times journalism to this growing digital Spanish-speaking audience. I invite you and your readers to reach out to me directly with any suggestions to improve translations - we, and our readers, will greatly appreciate them. Un abrazo, EL elopez@nytimes.com ", "title": "", "parent": "390", "creatorid": "d34068f9dfe8", "id": "1c0b3baddea9"}
