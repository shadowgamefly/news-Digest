{"name": "1130_2", "child": "", "content": "This, above all other essays I\u2019ve read, connected with me and hit me with such emotion I was barely able to contain myself. For years I was trying to understand the following: Why I always felt \u2018not normal,\u2019 or why there was something \u2018wrong with me.\u2019Why I felt, as a teen, that I was supposed to have been born a girl.Why I struggled with low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.Why I had a hard time making friends.Why I felt I didn\u2019t know who I was.Why I felt my primary purpose in life was to sit there and do what I was told.Why I felt useless.Why I \u2018needed\u2019 approval, etc.Why my family seemed to have two sets of rules\u200a\u2014\u200aone for me, and one for the other boys my age. Now, here was the problem: I didn\u2019t add any of this all together until a year ago. Now I am on hrt and my whole world has changed. Everything. I am not saying I\u2019m \u2018cured\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200abut a great deal of these things went by the wayside. The journal has not just been a physical one so far\u200a\u2014\u200abut an emotional one, as well. Even two days ago (four months into my transition), I find I am still learning about myself. Reading this article helped me realize just how much of my issues stemmed from my gender identity issues\u2026 Thanks for this; it changed my life.
