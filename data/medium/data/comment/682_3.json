{"name": "682_3", "child": "", "content": "One of the most befuddling feelings is feeling happiness while experiencing emotional pain or the ability to reflect upon a beautiful scene while experiencing loss. The true trait of happiness and other emotions and state of being is to recognize that emotions have ebbs and flows, highs and lows. Reflection upon a day is key to realizing your day did not go as badly as one thought. Did you connect with someone while waiting in line for coffee? Did you help someone with directions? Did you receive help? Talk to someone you had not seen in a long time? Find a wallet and was able to return it to its owner? Helping others is beneficial for both parties. Reflection on these actions, small or large builds a foundation of overall happiness. ", "title": "", "parent": "682", "creatorid": "aa037d918682", "id": "d5bf1f994171"}
