{"name": "1763_1", "child": "", "content": "What bothers me about these tech companies having an agenda is that they don\u2019t need one. Industrial companies had agendas that served their business interests, anti union, pro/anti tarrif, etc. It served a purpose for their business. Does Google need an agenda? No, because our business environment for tech companies is already amazing. They are allowed a certain amount of idealism because of this, yet they fail. How long did it take Google to ignore it\u2019s mantra of don\u2019t be evil? How long did it take Jeff Bezos to turn the Washington Post into even more of a liberal rag\u200a\u2014\u200athis supposedly great libertarian businessman? Medium should be only about the content. If they want to prune content like reddit did with coontown? Fine, that\u2019s a perfectly smart business decision. But don\u2019t silence voices by omission. Don\u2019t elevate by commission. All of that being said, I really do appreciate your writing here. You added form to a vague concept I had, that of success being the key to leaving the underclass. You have a laser like focus and analytical abilities that are second to none here. ", "title": "", "parent": "1763", "creatorid": "2c9e2066adf2", "id": "82034f0cc97e"}
