Building that sort of \u201cmetaphorical road system\u201d has complications that can be easily described if you\u2019ve ever gone into a multi-tenant building\u2019s utility closet: it\u2019s a mess that no one wants to ever clean, and degrades services that no one wants to fix. And if my company is going to use something, I have to be able to fix it and service it. That\u2019s the part that everyone forgets. Yes, the multi-user-road metaphor is a great ideal, but in the real world you have a busted line and 10 days before anyone knows who is responsible for fixing it.
