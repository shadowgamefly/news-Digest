{"name": "945_6", "child": "", "content": "I think Basic Income would put choice back in the hands of the poor, and that\u2019s essential. I trust that when people have a choice they make better decisions than when they don\u2019t have a choice. Regarding other social policies, I do write in the article that Basic Income does not replace Health Care for instance, nor does it replace Education. As for other support beyond Health Care and Education, I feel like the best solution is to have more non-cash support offered, but not imposed. The key is to give people the tools to create their own path, not create a path for them. ", "title": "", "parent": "945", "creatorid": "89e78005a383", "id": "14b9b08ea4c6"}
