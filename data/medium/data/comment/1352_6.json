{"name": "1352_6", "child": "", "content": "Great read! I fear that GMO\u2019s are here to stay and it worries me mostly because I just don\u2019t think the science boys really know the unintended consequences of their work. We have problems occurring without explanations, everything from bees to autism, ocean dead zones and superweeds. We have corporate monoculture farming where soils are sterilized rather than enriched by natural means. The only effective push back is at the point of sale. I simply don\u2019t buy anything with GMO\u2019s. That means no corn or soy certainly, only cane suger, and organic at every opportunity. I\u2019ve taken up gardening and on my small regular city lot I produce boatloads of great food. Asparagus, corn, tomatos, potatos, beans, cucumbers, melons, peppers, raspberries and blueberrys. Lots of people are doing it and I\u2019ll take that over lab-food any day. ", "title": "", "parent": "1352", "creatorid": "b7ae2d420953", "id": "dd4908d0690c"}
