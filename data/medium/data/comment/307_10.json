Although I\u2019ve been reducing my distractions, I still need to practice maintaining focus. I\u2019ve found that after a small win, I purposely look for the distraction. I reach out to my phone and see if anything new has happened. The good thing is that I\u2019m aware of this and I\u2019m actively trying to be better.
