{"name": "121_1", "child": "", "content": "Anyone who actually watches Serie A or plays Football Manager (or both!) knows about Dybala. He\u2019s a stud. There is a reason that Real Madrid were sniffing around him last summer with a fee roughly starting at Pogba money. I will say I think the Higuain purchase was a mistake, excepting that it crippled Juve\u2019s closest Serie A competition. As great as Juve were today, Higuain missed THREE glorious, glorious chances to put the game well and truly to bed. He has missed winners in three straight finals with Argentina. He\u2019s a good player, and he steamrolls lesser teams domestically, but in the biggest games, I find him lacking. Hopefully, this Juve team is so strong at the back that even mighty Barcelona are going to be shut down in the return leg.
