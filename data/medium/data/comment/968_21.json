You know, it felt exactly as you said Katie Painter\u200a\u2014\u200aromantic. You can\u2019t imagine how proud I was! Changing thing, creating a history, all that cool stuff. But do you know what happened after? Generally speaking, my whole life went down. I lived in fear for years. Depressions were normal for me. Not once or even twice I was thinking of suicide. Well, as you can see I managed to manage myself and to survive. The romantic stuff was over very soon, but the struggle lasted for years. I lost pretty much everything and everyone. Only few but strongest connections with my past remained strong. I live in the US now as a refugee. And when people ask me oppinion about politics.. Well, I don\u2019t think about it at all. The last time I did I\u2019ve learned a lesson. The hard one. The only think I hope will never happen to me again\u200a\u2014\u200ais the violence of revolution and war. Now when it\u2019s nothing else but past\u200a\u2014\u200aI value peace and calm like nothing else. And I\u2019m glad to see that at least some people don\u2019t fall for all this crap. Because that\u2019s not romantic at all. Violence create only more violence. Peace \u2764 ", "title": "", "parent": "968", "creatorid": "8036c513ac1a", "id": "d99c950b1709"}
