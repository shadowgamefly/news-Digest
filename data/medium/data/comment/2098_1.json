If you exhibit your symptoms, it *might* be demons, we\u2019re still not quite sure but we do think it\u2019s almost positively contagious. And if you don\u2019t exhibit your symptoms, we can pretend that you don\u2019t have demons (maybe). Maybe we should just call depression \u201cdiabetes\u201d; it would sure get a better response. With the ever-increasing numbers of new diagnoses for depression in our society\u2026we\u2019d better get rid of the stigma. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to have to bell/book/candle Grandmom and the surly teenagers; our boss, co-workers and the barista that makes our macho super grande latte frappacino, soy, extra caramel syrup and 2 espresso shots. When people talk about exercise, they\u2019re really saying \u201cexorcise\u201d; it will probably end up being a drive-thru service. Hang in there; you\u2019ve got this even when you think your depression is the one in charge. It\u2019s not. But it is a nearly fail-safe method of finding out who your real friends are\u200a\u2014\u200abecause they love you, no matter what. And of course, the rest of us depressedly, clinically depressed people are here for you as well. Peace and blessings! ", "name": "2098_1", "id": "48bf872f6fa8"}
