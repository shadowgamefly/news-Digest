Or to put it another way: congratulations, you just invented Fascism (including a very neat way to formulate the \u201cif you\u2019re not with us, you\u2019re against us\u201d-clause). Of course, \u201cleader-as-superman\u201d organizations are great at quickly and forcefully going after opportunities. They\u2019re also great at marching off a cliff. But since there are so many organizations of this type, especially among small start-ups, there will be a share that succeeds amazingly. However, once you get to a certain size of organization you don\u2019t want supermen, you want caretakers. Sure, Steve Jobs lucked out a number of times. And if you have a million entrepreneurs throwing coins all the time you\u2019re bound to get a couple that throw all heads. And those are the ones we glorify and look up to. But that doesn\u2019t mean that high risk, follow the glorious leader plays, is the best way to succeed over time. Yes, you can be an angel investor or an early adopter, hoping for high gains to offset your loses. But for me, when I put my money in a company, I want stable. I don\u2019t want Steve Jobs\u2014 I want Warren Buffett. ", "title": "", "parent": "332", "creatorid": "81517848a5d7", "id": "fec80a36ebd8"}
