{"name": "1389_1", "child": "", "content": "Unfortunately, the discussion is often anti-intellectual and incompetent. How does \u201clogic\u201d apply if it makes sense only for the one exercising it? You can very \u201clogically\u201d argue that the Earth is flat or that it\u2019s shaped like a banana. It should be a reference to professional experts instead, otherwise it\u2019s brainwash. For example, there is this narrative about the travel ban passed around, that it wasn\u2019t unconstitutional because it didn\u2019t have the word \u201cMuslims\u201d in it. They\u2019ve heard it affected only a small number of people in airports, and anyway, a visa doesn\u2019t guarantee entree. Hence the judge is biased, media is lying about the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, the protesters are hysterical or hired, and the other side once again demonstrated their inability to understand \u201clogical\u201d reasoning. Yada-yada-yada. ", "title": "", "parent": "1389", "creatorid": "681b93e86b8b", "id": "89961c168221"}
