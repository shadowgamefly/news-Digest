{"name": "1745_1", "child": "", "content": "To be honest I was a little sceptical when I started to read. Especially so because I just met someone who gets up at 4.30 a.m to cook breakfast and lunch before she hits the fitness training class at 6 a.m. She is back home by 7.15 a.m. She is ready to finish whatever little is left of cooking and school lunch boxes are packed for the children by 8 a.m. I stood in awe when I heard her. But at the same time, I resisted the urge to admit that I am lazy. I cannot get up that early that just because I have to go for an intense workout. I loved your blog. It has a lot of doable stuff that will definitely give the day a good start! ", "title": "", "parent": "1745", "creatorid": "d4715a4b7865", "id": "f90cb8d9cb36"}
