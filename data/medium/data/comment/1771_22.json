{"name": "1771_22", "child": "", "content": "This is a fascinating subject\u2026 the belief that making the world a smaller place through social media will unite people and how it\u2019s done the opposite. Of course it has. Then it pused forward into social engineering through conscripted diversity and weighing the ideas of compulsory diversity. That will never work. Cultural marxism, just like economic marxism, is doomed to fail. (Economic marxism will be a reality for the brief time between robots/AI doing 100% of the work until AI decides we\u2019re ants not worth serving.) We cannot brainwash an entire population to have a uniformed opinion or respect for others, especially those with opinions that are not worthy of respect. Good ideals, tenet, and absolute moral rationality rise to the surface through the contrast of the indoctrinated, the superstitious and the morally reprehensible. Any and all attempts to block, shout down, mute, ban or homogenize opinions will backfire in the most specular of ways.
