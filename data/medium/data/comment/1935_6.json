{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "daac4de20e02", "content": "Lavine is 21 years old and put up 18 ppg and 43% from 3pt after he repeated as dunk champion and got put into the starting lineup. Wiggins is 21 and put up 20.7 ppg 46%FG\u2026.Butler put up 20.9 ppg 45% shooting\u2026.So why exactly would the Wolves want to trade Lavine OR Wiggins for this guy? They are young and still on rookie contracts. I would give up the number 5 pick for the guy and rubio or Dieng\u2026but thats about it. KAT, Lavine, and Wiggins all averaged over 18 ppg after the All star game\u2026at just over 20 years old. If Thibs trades Wiggins or Lavine ima be pissed.
