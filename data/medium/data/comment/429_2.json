{"name": "429_2", "child": "", "content": "A thousands-of-words ad, masquerading as journalism, extolling the virtues of the latest pyramid scheme? Not what I expect to see from this publication. I hope y\u2019all got paid well for this, cause if you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ve been had. Scams like this aren\u2019t made fresh and new just because they exhort their marks to pester family and friends via Facebook instead of face-to-face. And they are nothing like the real direct sales (think Fuller brushes) of yore. They intentionally prey on SAHMs and other women who want to earn money but because of caring responsibilities have a hard time working outside the home, luring them to drop hundreds of dollars on \u201cstarter sales kits\u201d that in reality comprise most of the main office\u2019s income. Shameful excuse for reporting. (Edit: the text editor removed my tags and replaced them with the nonsense tags you see below.)
