But you shoudn\u00b4t make one single screen if you haven\u00b4t sketch all the (or at least the most of it) user flow first. Once you\u00b4ve tested your sketchs with your team and /or stakeholders then you can start building wireframes, that way you will build essentialy what you know it\u00b4s on the right path. Maybe you\u00b4ll need to go back and do some more sketchs, validate them and go back to wireframes. Sketching has allways been the fastest way to test an idea and share it. Maybe the are some companies (people) that has the culture of wireframing all, the problem isn\u2019t wireframes, the problem its the methodology. Cheers!
