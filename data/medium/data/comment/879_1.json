I like fashion more than the next person and its sad that people can still over look the suffering of animals to get dressed. Lets not forget people, that fur (and anything else you see in H&M or in the shows) IS BEING CHOSEN FOR YOU.

Thanks though, I\u2019ve let my PETA pledge lapse and have now updated that. ", "title": "", "parent": "879", "creatorid": "f92d8b77134e", "id": "1b37606562f9"}
