{"name": "339_10", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for publishing these thoughts. As a first time fund manager (www.deepspacevc.com), in my first year, it\u2019s super helpful to read things like this. Many of the thoughts here resonate with the experiences I\u2019ve had so far, or even help me crystallize my thoughts around some of those experiences that I haven\u2019t quite been able to do on my own. The way I\u2019ve tried to describe my role as far as with each portfolio company, is a \u201cutility fielder\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI am just there to play third base when needed and I\u2019m there to shag batting practice balls when there is nothing else to do. Sometimes I\u2019m asked to build a financial model, sometimes I\u2019m asked to help figure out who to hire, and sometimes I\u2019m asked for just emotional support when dealing with \u201cthings\u201d as a CEO/founder just wants to vent sometimes. I know this for sure; nothing, and everything, I\u2019ve done before is directly relevant to what I\u2019m doing now!
