I probably read your story in not the best frame of mind\u200a\u2014\u200awhat with all this shitty political scene playing out in the way it is playing out. That said, whether you meant it to be or not, it is a click bait title. When I came across it in my feed I didn\u2019t know who you were. I wouldn\u2019t have read it if your title had not implied that all it took was a little dollar book that gave you the epiphany that made you a billionaire. The book did unstick you from a place where you were stuck in your project but, if you wouldn\u2019t have found the book, would you have just given up and said, \u201cFuck it. This is too hard. I\u2019m now going to study and become a brain surgeon.\u201d No, you would have looked for the solution and found it somewhere else. That seeming facile easy-ness is what bothers me in the title. I\u2019m working on setting up my own business, follow my American dream\u200a\u2014\u200anot at your scale, God, no! It is just a small group travel agency that I\u2019m setting up. And it is not easy. I\u2019m still looking for that dollar book that will solve my sticking point and propel me to prosperity. Maybe that\u2019s what frustrates me about the title. (If you or anyone else you know can help please do let me know!) Again, my apologies for coming across as too harsh. ", "title": "", "parent": "602", "creatorid": "7eead9661e4e", "id": "28a44d45ae7"}
