{"name": "1567_16", "child": "", "content": "I am from California, and did not support the filibuster, so your presupposition that 43 senators represented 53% of the population is inaccurate, as you presume you can include all Californians, when many, of us not only disagreed with the filibuster, but even wrote to our senators (I wrote Senator Feinstein) asking her to not do so. Obviously she disregarded me, and many other Californians who were equally dismayed at their intention to do this, considering Gorsuch is a qualified worthy candidate. And especially, when the only reason a vacancy was being filled, was due to the untimely sudden death of Justice Scalia. For those 43 senators to behave in this fashion, especially when the Supreme Court is supposed to be a non-political body, and the Justice who died, was already a conservative, all their actions demonstrated, was that they do not want us to have an objective judiciary, and wish to politicize it, which I feel is a severe injustice to us all. I believe the more politically balanced that our highest Court is, the more assured Americans can be that we have a fair objective group of jurists who can accurately apply the law without bias. So please don\u2019t twist the numbers because the 53 percent, assumes the entire state\u2019s 39 million people agree with our two senators petulant actions, when many of us here absolutely do not, and even voiced this to our senators.
