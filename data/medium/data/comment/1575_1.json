I\u2019m a constituent of yours (81301), and wanted to let you know that myself and everyone I know and have come in contact with at work (when the subject of politics comes up\u2026as it often does), are deeply concerned about this issue\u200a\u2014\u200aamong others\u200a\u2014\u200ain this administration. Please know we support you 100% and appreciate the work you\u2019re doing to maintain the integrity and separation of powers of the branches, and holding the executive branch accountable for its abhorrent and reckless behavior. As Lisa says below, having a strong judicial branch that is hopefully following the Constitution is our best hope for a strong and continued democracy. The Trump administration\u2019s repeated attacks on any journalist/reporting entity that disagrees with its policies is disturbing, as it is one of the warning signs of fascism.
