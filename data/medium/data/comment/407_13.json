{"name": "407_13", "child": "", "content": "Benjamin Franklin Though there were messaging apps before whatsapp they were not widely adopted by Indians. Skype and other apps required you to have an email id. There were a lot of people here who didn\u2019t have an email account but had a phone with internet connectivity. Whatsapp only required you to have a phone number. Hence it was widely adopted. Skype and other apps didn\u2019t reach this scale of adoption here. Even if I was on Skype or on the other apps my friends wouldn\u2019t be on it. The only way to reach them was through SMS. I hope this makes it clear.
