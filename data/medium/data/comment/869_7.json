{"name": "869_7", "child": "", "content": "maybe pepsi was inspired by michael jackson\u2019s \u201cheal the world\u201d video (and say what you want, people, i love michael forever). except mj\u2019s video had children playing and giving armed soldiers flowers in order to bring everyone together. so pepsi just replaced \u201cchildren\u201d with \u201ckendall jenner\u201d and \u201cflowers\u201d with \u201cpepsi.\u201d and i note that a little blond girl is the most prominent child to give the soldier a flower, dammit mj. this video always makes me tear up a little, partly because it\u2019s so ridiculously naively optimistic, and this will never, ever happen with human beings because we are terrible. yet, it *should* be as easy as \u201clet\u2019s stop killing each other because of children and, like, decency and stuff.\u201d but no, we\u2019re still killing children with, say, sarin gas. humans suck. (ot: i don\u2019t know where this video is supposed to take place\u2026 it was made in 1991, so maybe in some recently devastated former eastern bloc country? but then asian and african children show up in the same place at the end so\u2026 it\u2019s weird). but whatever. i dig the symbolism and hope in this video, but always found it a little naive that mj didn\u2019t realize a lot of those soldiers would have just shot those children.  maybe pepsi was emulating michael because they felt bad for setting his hair on fire that one time.
