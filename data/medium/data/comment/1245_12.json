{"name": "1245_12", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m always falling. I am always misunderstood. Since this time last year, I\u2019ve been at a loss as to which direction to take, how to continue my life. I have worked under several employers. I have done a lot of research on what I can possibly do for work and, to be honest, I can\u2019t imagine myself even doing something I like for more than two years straight. I love varying my routine. I am still at a dead end. The world of work is extremely limiting. I always walk strong. I always continue. I tell myself that the present situation is only temporary (though, I don\u2019t know how long this will last). I would like this phase and feeling to go. I wish I knew what to do regularly to earn money and be satisfied at the same time. I also wish that people didn\u2019t tell me that I was less valuable than an extroverted person. I hope that I find people who accept me for me. I wish to meet more people who would look in my heart and believe in me. I am 29 and quite obsessed with my age (age in general) because I wonder how I could fail so much with people just for being more of a listener than a speaker when I\u2019m no longer a child. But in life we attract certain people. In life, we don\u2019t always fit the people we meet. I have to be okay. I hope so.
