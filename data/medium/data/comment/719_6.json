{"name": "719_6", "child": "", "content": "Interesting thoughts. I personally have been questioning myself on this point too. I work at a startup under the title \u2018User Experience Designer\u2019. I agree with you that we cannot design a user\u2019s experience. Everyone has their own experience. But my opinion is that we can design for the user\u2019s experience. Meaning: trying our best to make the right design decisions so the user\u2019s experience is as close as possible to the experience we want them to have or how we envisioned it. Your second point: I also agree with you that a great User Experience should everyone\u2019s responsibility. But I think it all depends on the company you work for. Creating an outstanding UX might not have the highest priority. As a matter of fact I have personal experiences with agencies where usability testing, research and prototyping were the first things to be thrown out of the window when budgets ran low or when deadlines were not met. In these cases it was often the client who did not have the user\u2019s experience high upon their list of \u2018important things\u2019. I think in situations like these someone with the title User Experience Designer\u200a\u2014\u200aas a generalist\u2014 can play a critical role. Having someone with that title representing the user implies authority and can enforce importance on the subject. But I do agree that in an ideal world where the importance of the user\u2019s experience is seen by all, that we should move away from the broad term \u2018User Experience Designer\u2019 and name people by what they do. Would certainly make it easier for me to explain what I am doing to other people\u00a0:). ", "title": "", "parent": "719", "creatorid": "49fd201f50ef", "id": "5b11a628d92b"}
