It was never supposed to be published. It was never supposed to actually be a sequel\u200a\u2014\u200athe original version of the story simply took place years after the actual events of TKAM and in editing she decided to focus on that aspect. Sadly Harper Les suffered from a stroke some years ago and her cognitive function and memory were impaired. The publishing company only approached her about the sequel after her sister (and guardian) died. The company made a lot of money by publishing it. So it\u2019s fair to say that your assessment stands. She should be remembered for her first novel and not the second.
