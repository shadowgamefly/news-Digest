Consider a climber, training in a gym or half-way up a mountain\u200a\u2014\u200ait makes no difference. Every sequence they climb teaches them a movement, a way of using their muscles in harmony to apply forces downwards, outwards and often upwards\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever counter-intuitive that may be. These forces combine and the result propels them in the direction in which they desire to move. Every time, however small it might be, some new concept of movement is etched into their unconsciousness. Learning is like this. Everything one learns imparts some new concept of thought and who are we, short-lived and inexperienced at eighty, to predict where those thought patterns will be useful? Facts and knowledge might be disposable but learning is never wasted if it makes one think in a new fashion. ", "name": "2204_19", "id": "b56fdb8ccc7f"}
