{"name": "18_8", "child": "", "content": "That is damn fine writing. And reporting. People fail to recall here in the 21st century the prescience of Kurt Vonnegut. After reading your story here, all I could think was God bless you, Mr Rosewater. Googling it a moment ago, I landed on this small bit from the book: \u201cThus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday sun.\u201d Memory is a funny thing. The long and short of it. Thanks for contributing to our national memory and God bless you, Mr Fahrenthold. ", "title": "", "parent": "18", "creatorid": "8c2a9d7aff35", "id": "e2d6ce3fb4d1"}
