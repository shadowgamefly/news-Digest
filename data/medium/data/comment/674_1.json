{"name": "674_1", "child": "", "content": "Hi Tracy, Thank you for this moving and insightful piece on the Brexit. As a US citizen married to an EU citizen, I have a slightly different vantage point from yours, but my reaction to this debacle was similar to what you expressed. I am frankly appalled that a country with England\u2019s educational and scientific traditions could fall prey to the forces of ignorance on such a crucial issue and at national level. Now, I am not in any position to feel superior, given Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy in my land of origin. I am just cheesed off, big time. And like you, I feel betrayed. I am offended by the notion of older folks voting to restrict the freedoms that young people need to get the education they want, to move where the jobs are and to have equal rights when they get there. Plus, the UK has a low birth rate, so immigrants will have to be among the workers paying for your pensions, you old fools. Overlooked that bit, did we? My daughter, an Italian EU citizen, will head for the U of Brighton in September. What will change over the next three year for students like her, who in the UK have suddenly ceased to be fellow Europeans? Now she is just a foreigner.
