{"name": "935_1", "child": "", "content": "The arguments are fair. When the debtor is another financial institution (which is always the case with large investment banks), in a crisis, the government cannot force the debt-to-equity clause. Yet, it is doubtful that insisting on a more than 10% capital requirement can be realistic or safe. Unused captive capital is dead money during the \u201cpeace\u201d years that can create more \u201csustainable\u201d growth.\u201cSustainable\u201d growth must be the target actively, rather than defensive measures of capital requirement. In a crisis, capital erosion and complex counter party arrangements are going to make any level of capital holding moot. It would far better to focus on the practices of the bank to limit the level of risk and leverage in the system as opposed to the individual banks. A systemic failure like the last financial crisis, and arguably any in the future, cannot be controlled with unit level measures. It rather needs an aggregate look at de-levering the system.
