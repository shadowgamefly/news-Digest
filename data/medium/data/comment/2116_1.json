A recurring theme, aside from the truly bizarre lifestyle that he maintained, was the fact that he (almost) constantly led one to grow by throwing obstacles in your path. Herbie told me about a time when Miles saw/sensed/heard/felt that Herbie\u2019s ideas were not flowing comfortably during one gig. Silently, he slipped around behind and ventriloquized for him to emphasize a different note in the bottom register of the keyboard\u200a\u2014\u200aa note that had nothing to do with the composition\u2019s key at all. Nobody in their right musical mind would have done that during a solo, but a suggestion from The Chief (as us jazz cats used to refer to Miles as\u2026) was not to be ignored. Therefore, Herbie went for the note and it immediately clashed with the entire event, pulling the rug out from under the band\u2019s feet! As the band-members were forced to shift from \u201ccomfort\u201d to \u201csurvival\u201d, Herbie was then inspired to somehow \u201cturn that poison into medicine\u201d and create a musical contingency plan/solo which took the composition and band to altogether another dimension of brilliance which the audience (and colleagues!) had never experienced before. Once the song was over, Miles looked at Herbie and silently said, \u201cSee?\u201d On the road in Europe with The Manhattan Transfer during the summer of \u201989, we often opened festival concerts for The Chief\u2019s band. His band consisted mostly of top New York City players, so we would all hang out at the festival hotels, during sound-check and, personally, I wouldn\u2019t miss any of their performances! After one really cool show came to an end, I noticed Miles talking to Adam Holzman, keyboardist and musical director, before he left the stage. The conversation was short and Miles left the stage laughing, after their brief exchange. As Adam walked towards the stage exit, where I happened to be, he, however, did not look happy. \u201cDude\u2026slammin\u2019 show, man!\u201d, I told him\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He looked at me in the eyes and said, \u201cHe came over and said, \u2018Adam, you\u2019re playing it wrong!\u2019\u201d When adam, sincerely concerned, had asked him, \u201cWhich part, Miles?\u201d\u2026The Chief had immediately replied, \u201cEverything!\u201d\u2026and, then, burst into raucous laughter all the way off the stage. Between that night and the next show, Adam completely re-formulated the band\u2019s concept, writing fresh arrangements for every musician, including himself. This new concept wasn\u2019t rehearsed before the subsequent show, but rather, launched mercilessly point-blank, in front of the live audience. Typical of a slick New York band, the cats went for it, pulling no punches\u2026 and slayed it! I witnessed this show, and can attest to the fact that it was awesome! And, I also caught The Chief sending a couple of one-second smiles over to my friend, Adam. A mentor helps you to perceive your own weaknesses and confront them with courage. The bond between mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 enables us to stay true to our chosen path until the very end.
