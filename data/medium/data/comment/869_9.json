{"name": "869_9", "child": "", "content": "The problem is Pepsi did not realize how America is now the \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d Country. Groups like BLM hold America hostage, everything is either all about them and their struggle or they explode. But what is their real message? We see the slogan about Black lives matter but in their own actions\u2026.. do they? Do they show that Black lives matter? The only time we hear from them is when a cop shoots a Black man, no matter if the shooting is justified or not they lead rioting and protests and complain. Even one of their \u201cposter children\u201d Michael Brown we now know from hard evidence that he never had his hands up, was never on his knees surrendering, and based on blood spatter evidence we know beyond any shadow of doubt that Brown was in fact charging at the officer when the fatal bullets hit his body. So the shooting was justified, but we saw tens of millions of dollars of destruction in Ferguson and still today they drag his name into the BLM movement. But at the same time if a little girl is killed by Black gangs in a drive by, pure silence from BLM. Do the deaths of innocent Black children matter? The biggest problem in Black lives is other Blacks, not cops. If BLM wants to be seen as legitimate they need to stop propping up names like Michael Brown who were thugs and start showing concern for actual Black lives in black communities. This writer and others seem to be trying to shake down Pepsi and pressure them into giving BLM money. I hope Pepsi does not fall for it.
