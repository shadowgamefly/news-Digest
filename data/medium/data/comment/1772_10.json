{"name": "1772_10", "child": "", "content": "The problem is also that many modern media outlets, and increasingly more legacy ones, have largely abandoned any pretence of journalistic standards in part due to the economics of the modern \u201cnewsroom\u201d, where verification and fact-checking are costly and outrage and hyperbole are magnets for attention. Instead, many have adopted the roles of activists, making all the mistakes that come with letting passion cloud judgement and privileging the stories of \u201cclaims-makers\u201d over hard evidence.

In one recent study, journalists are now trusted less than estate agents and bankers. Much has to be done to recover this trust.
