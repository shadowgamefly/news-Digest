{"id": "bacd6601d699", "content": "NYC is not that Awsome. I lived there for 10yrs and I agree that no matter what the item may be you never get what you pay for. Housing is overpriced (with minimal living space), food is overpriced, the streets smell like urine in the summer (because so many people piss the streets year round. Not gonna lie have contributed to this issue\u00a0:)), and transportation is overpriced. Now with that said, I would not move to New Jersey if my mother\u2019s life, and my testicles, depended on it. The parts worth living in have similar issues as New York City and the parts not worth living in are a-holes. And don\u2019t let me get into how confusing their highway system is. NJ is not the answer! Do yourself a favor and move somewhere warm. See you in Miami;) Oh yeah and Follow M Wheeler Books on Medium.
