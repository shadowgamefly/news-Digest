{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "59037087bc09", "content": "Hello Gail I found it difficult to answer your question of whether the generation of a menu of different dishes from a given number of ingredients came from a restaurateur/commercial cook or from a domestic cook. Historians may or may not agree with me that supportive evidence with a reliable date stamp (not a novel of fiction), as searched back to the year dot, is hard to find or even non-existent, given that there is a probable general lack of that level of documentary evidence. Given necessity is the mother of invention, if you were the army cook in a besieged garrison, you would have to very soon (say, between meals\u00a0!!) figure out this \u201cnew\u201d menu to feed your troop\u2026..or in times of famine, any cook (worth his/her weight in salt\u00a0!!!) using limited resources of ingredients, whether in a domestic or commercial situation, would have to very soon arrive at this solution. So my comment is open, and above all, \u201clet us eat and be merry\u201d\u00a0!!! ", "creatorid": "2fbfb98b7085", "name": "2001_7", "parent": "2001"}
