So keep going by trees, listening that voice in the head:\u201cFeelings are freezing and thoughts are made of sand\u201dKeep using confusion to pretend the sorrows are dead,Keep telling you\u2019re here, when you are on some other land. Ps.: I do not usually write in english, so forgive me for any inconvenience. Anyhow, thank you for the opportunity to do so\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "564", "creatorid": "93585985246", "id": "f112cdea7b22"}
