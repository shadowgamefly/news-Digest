I know you live in a liberalbubble, and it\u2019s very hard for you to understand that people have political views outside of your\u2019s, but if you don\u2019t want to alienate 53% of white women in this country, which are potential or current customers, stick to your product and not politics. It\u2019s bad business. I know it\u2019s really popular right now to say \u201cWomen kick-ass\u201d and \u201cGirl-Power\u201d but in reality you come off as immature and give off the vibe that women should think with their private parts and not with their brain. Were all a little tired of identity politics and telling people how to vote based on their skin color or gender. ", "title": "", "parent": "1351", "creatorid": "183135365b0", "id": "6a8aa8d6e6d"}
