{"name": "1383_2", "child": "", "content": "\u201cSo why are psychologists breaking with tradition now?\u201d They are not; they are breaking the Law, for political reasons, not clinical ones. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and clearly America would be better off is all 58,000 were disbarred from practising psychology. Psychologists so lacking in ethics cannot be doing their patients much good. All politicians are malignant Narcissists. So are all psychologists, as is borne out by the following true joke. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between God and a psychologist?\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t think He\u2019s a psychologist!\u201d This isn\u2019t 100% True, but it is as true as the above smear campaign by left-wing psychologists, and as I am not a psychologist, I can say so without losing my licence to practice. Psychologists cannot; and the President should invoke the \u201c Goldwater Rule\u201d in their ethics handbook that forbids diagnosing public figures. \u201cIn Judaism, there is a principle called \u201cPikuach Nefesh\u201d which says that it\u2019s okay to break a rule in order to save a human life.\u201d That\u2019s true but, Not all mental health professionals are Jewish,\u201cPikuach Nefesh\u201d has no standing in US Law, andThere is no evidence that breaking their own ethics rule by publicly slandering the President will \u201csave a human life.\u201d It is evidence of extreme paranoia to think that the President intends any harm to any individual. NewsFlash! Only DEMOCRAT psychologists think this.Trump is a counter-puncher rather than a bully. He has learned that when a bully sets upon you, get at least one good counter-punch in. You may still taking a beating, but he will think twice about attacking you again. All the supposed \u201cAgressions\u201d you accuse Trump of, are Tweets responding to earlier attacks on him. A tweet is about the most harmless thing one person can do: if you don\u2019t like it, no-one forces you to read it. note too that his counter-punch is always proportional to the original attack: he responds, he doesn\u2019t escalate. My conclusion is that Trump is not insane, he is a businessman, and he is learning the Presidency on the fly. He has learnt that to excel at anything you have to try new things, be prepared to Fail Fast to Learn Fast. To honour his election promises, he knows he will have to act decisively, something that the political elites haven\u2019t done in the last few decades, to get things done. That to me sounds like what the American people voted for, and a sane man knows that \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting something to change.\u201d That is what Hillary Clinton promised more of the same thing over and over, as had failed in the Obama era. These Psychologists should consider the ancient adage: \u201cPhysician, heal thyself!\u201d Nearly 60,000 mental health professionals have been diagnosed with a type of insanity that is often compared to an alcoholic\u2019s lack of honesty and impulse control: attacking President Donald Trump.
