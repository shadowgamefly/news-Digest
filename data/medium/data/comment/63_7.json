{"content": "A good write. To complete the jigsaw, just consider that not all forms of human power are the formal ones of government, law, business etc. in which males are dominant. In terms of relationships, women have always had the upper hand in many areas. Contrary to what feminism likes to pretend, the male is not naturally some mad rapist who does not give a shit for women. Look around and generally you will see that men put themselves out more for women than women do for men\u200a\u2014\u200aat least within close relationships. Men and women might be more or less equal before the law, but that cannot get rid of biological differences that drive us all\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is not to say that the one sex dominates the other overall. In the absence of true equality, harmony is possible\u200a\u2014\u200aand surely more desirable than a boring world where everyone is the same sex. I would beware of people like Gloria Steinam who make money by flogging a narrative. There comes a point where all such people who hawk an ideology can no more question that ideology than a prostitute can become a nun. Actually, the case in my analogy is probably less impossible!
