{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "93687f4f87b7", "content": "The price of writing has devalued to almost zero. Look at Kindle, market prices for a 100-page book are between $0.99 and $4.99. So the price we\u2019re willing to pay authors has dropped to 1\u20135 cents per page per reader. I remember when books were $25\u201340 in the bookstore, but those days are long gone. It\u2019s very hard nowadays to earn a living purely with writing. There are still a few well-paying online platforms available. Medium has started paying their top contributors (but I don\u2019t know how much\u200a\u2014\u200athey turned down my $150 pitch for a story\u00a0;). Seeking Alpha pays $35-$500 for a stock tip, which is basically just writing about finance. I\u2019m sure there are others. I tried for a while to make a living on Seeking Alpha, but even with their generous payments I couldn\u2019t make it work. I would have to churn out one article per day to make a living. With all the research involved, that was plainly impossible. I\u2019ve abandoned writing as my primary source of income. I only do it on the side for brand awareness.
