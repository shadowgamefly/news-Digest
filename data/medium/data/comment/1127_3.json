Trump reminds me of a classic \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode titled, \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life.\u201d In this episode, we see an adorable 6-year-old boy named Anthony Freemont. Anthony lives in a farmhouse with his parents in a small village named Peaksville in what used to be rural Ohio. In the beginning, everything seems peaceful on the quiet farm until we realize Anthony has special powers that are causing quite a bit of disturbance within the community. Anthony has the ability to cause a blizzard on a summer day, ruining the crops. He has the ability to turn a gopher into a beast with three heads, turn pigs into monsters and wish playmates who challenge him into the corn field. He took away the cars, electricity, machines and soap, because he doesn\u2019t like them, flinging the Village back into the Dark Ages. He can command anything he wants by simply thinking it. He knows everyone\u2019s thoughts and can feel everyone\u2019s emotions. He hates anybody who doesn\u2019t like him or thinks bad thoughts about him. Anthony has destroyed the rest of the world as he holds the few remaining residents of Peaksville imprisoned with his demands. His parents and neighbors are so terrorized they cater to his every whim and must CONSTANTLY reassure him his monstrous deeds are \u201cGood, they\u2019re REAL Good.\u201d They must express their unconditional love for him, because they don\u2019t want to be his next victim. One evening a surprise birthday party is held for one of the few remaining neighbors, Dan. Dan receives a bottle of peach schnapps (one of the last bottles of liquor in the Village) and a Perry Como album. He desperately wants to listen to the record but Anthony doesn\u2019t like music with singing. Dan starts to get drunk from the schnapps and is fed up with the control Anthony has over them. He begs someone, ANYONE to kill the child, put a lamp or a bottle over his head when he\u2019s not looking, ANYTHING to end this nightmare once and for all. The adults in the room are begging him to stop talking but it\u2019s too late. With a scowl on his face, Anthony turns to Dan and transforms him into a hideous Jack-in-the Box, his head bobbing up and down on a spring as his wife watches, SCREAMING in horror. Anthony\u2019s father tells him to wish it into the corn field, so the grotesque image disappears and the room returns to normal, everyone desperately trying to control their emotions so as not to upset little Anthony as he continues his reign of terror. Anthony\u2019s father looks out the window and sees snow falling. He looks at Anthony and says, \u201cIt\u2019s snowing outside. Antony, are you makin\u2019 it snow? Why that\u2019ll ruin half the crops, ya\u2019 know that, don\u2019tcha, half of the crops!!!\u201d Anthony looks back with a scowl and his father replies, \u201cBut, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re makin\u2019 it snow, Anthony, it\u2019s REAL good and tomorrow, tomorrow, is gonna\u2019 be a REAL GOOD DAY!\u201d A monster is about to move into the White House. A childish, ignorant, illiterate, petty, vindictive, out-of-control, mentally unstable, emotionally damaged, destructive, psychopathic monster with no filter, no conscience, no discipline and no restraint. The weak and the ignorant put him there. ", "title": "", "parent": "1127", "creatorid": "b636d89779c6", "id": "5df2ef01c6a8"}
