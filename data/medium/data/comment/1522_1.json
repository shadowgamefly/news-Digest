{"name": "1522_1", "child": "", "content": "The problem with the \u201cworld solutions\u201d is that they are many times inflexible. The euro currency was made in order to create a stable, non-inflationary currency for many European countries. Greece, however, would need now not a stable currency, but a devaluated currency to cope temporarily with this big crisis. Most countries now want a stable currency, Greece needs a devaluated one. So what happens now? Why is it easier to impose a universal Currency Transaction Tax rather than each country individually impose that kind of tax that benefits it more depending the time and the circumstances? A few countries might be benefited by no CTA. Another country could regard as its benefit a high CTA, higher than the one proposed above. I don\u2019t believe that a so central planning would work. Moreover, in my opinion every tax that is imposed in any place of the world results in less total output. As a result, any tax imposed should have a really important reason to exist, such as protecting the poor people, educating the young generation etc. ", "title": "", "parent": "1522", "creatorid": "765fba315649", "id": "5be487d3dca0"}
