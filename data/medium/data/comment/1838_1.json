{"name": "1838_1", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m well over 50 and have never grown up. Sure, I deal with paying the mortgage, taking care of the plumbing issues, fix leaky roofs, get the kids through college\u2026 and now paying for wedding expenses quietly and discretely\u2026 to the outside world, I am a fully-grown man who is a responsible adult. But I\u2019m really just a kid whose body grew into this old man costume. I believe in magic. I say \u201cno rain, no rainbows\u201d a lot when bad things happen. There is always a rainbow after a rain. I grew up in a city. I loved my block but not living in my house. I envied the kids in the suburbs who didn\u2019t have four bars at the end of their street. But in hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I can still smell the memories of those bar parking lots. My kids grew up in the suburbs. Now that they are grown and flown, I yearn for a life again in a city with its hustle and bustle, the smells of filth, stale beer and piss; smells that may offend others but are sweet memories for me. Forward sometimes looks like going back. ", "title": "", "parent": "1838", "creatorid": "d81d49fe2c36", "id": "dfa4a9b80be3"}
