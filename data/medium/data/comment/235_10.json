A phone call or email from a friend, especially when it has been some time since I heard from that friend. Laughter from adults; giggles from children. A hug! Sharing what I have with others\u2026 Giving someone HOPE through a smile, a kind word, advice, whatever. Reading inspirational stories written by others. When a student \u201cgets it.\u201d When my husband says \u201cyou look great.\u201d I\u2019m of a certain age where the lines on my face show and I sometimes think of myself as the Saggy Baggy Elephant, even though I\u2019m not overweight. I could go on and on\u2026.but that\u2019s enough. Please notice that money is NOT listed here. I have enough to have a comfortable life\u200a\u2014\u200anot really rich, but not poor-either. I have enough $ to give away to others whose life circumstances is not as good as my own. THAT makes me both blessed and joyful. So glad you asked this question, Jessica. Maybe you\u2019ll get hundreds of answers to your query!!! ", "title": "", "parent": "235", "creatorid": "92158ba1a0fc", "id": "1fff2b5f4910"}
