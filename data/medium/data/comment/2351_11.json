Roy Schlegel\u00a0, Normal Earthling\u00a0, Meg\u00a0, Martino Pietropoli\u00a0. Did you know there is a talented artist whose focus centers upon decaying organic materials? Can\u2019t remember exactly which medium she prefers yet the art is without doubt fascinatingly strange and beautiful. Wait\u2026 it\u2019s pancakes, after all. So unfair! Now I have to go make my own and create an interesting topping, to boot. Easy enough with some sour cream, and so forth. Maybe I\u2019m the lucky one\u2026 Thank you\u00a0all, for your great writings, wonderfully creative minds, and mostly, absurdly limitless senses of humor. Appreciate that, thanks! #mscl ", "name": "2351_11"}
