{"name": "1539_1", "child": "", "content": "The slimy GOP, now on the wrong side of demographics, have to lie, cheat, and steal to win elections whether it is GOP gerrymandering, their GOP SCOTUS\u2019 Citizens United corruption of democracy that gives unlimited, usually anonymous, campaign funding by and for the rich and also allows the flood of false campaign ads by anonymous sources and \u201cdark money\u201d which the Koch brothers and other GOP extremists use to anonymously fund elections and to buy congressmen, state and local leaders, legislators. The GOP also pack courts particularly state supreme courts that can overturn lower courts and always favor corporations and greedy polluters doing harm to people and the environment. The wave of GOP voter suppression came after the GOP SCOTUS rolled back the Voting Rights Act that enabled a flood of state voter suppression laws where states like Texas persist even when ruled against claiming voter fraud which does not significantly exist. Notice that when in court the GOP fail to provide evidence of voter fraud or few cases like in Texas which showed one case out of 45 million votes and that person mistakenly voted in his deceased father\u2019s name as they both had the same name. It is the GOP that have created most of the problems that America and the working class face today that are the real \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1539", "creatorid": "1172df96f278", "id": "71a4b47787b1"}
