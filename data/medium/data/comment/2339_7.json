I come from a family that talks big about hustle and entrepreneurship but don\u2019t have the technical background to back it up. It left me in a worse off place because I grew up feeling entitled to not have a job, but lacking the ACTUAL skills to be a legit entrepreneur. All these listicles are exactly like that. There\u2019s a right time to quit a job strategically. There\u2019s a certain amount of background you need before starting a business (take an excel course or don\u2019t even start). I\u2019m in a better place now but not for lack of mistakes. @the author, A-fucking-men. A LOT less people need to be entrepreneurs if anything. ", "name": "2339_7"}
