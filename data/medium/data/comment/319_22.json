Honestly, a lot of emotions are a choice. Yes they are hard to move past or get over, however, you can change how you feel. Even simple emotions, take this morning for example, I was extremely tired and didn\u2019t want to get motivated or get up. I chucked on some good music started to force myself to sing and get into it then I just started to become happy. Its almost like fake it till you make it!
