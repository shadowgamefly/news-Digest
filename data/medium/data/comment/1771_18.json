{"name": "1771_18", "child": "", "content": "\u201c Private vendors are not engaged in the same social engineering project as the military and, as a result, tend to hire and fire people based on their ability to work effectively as a team.\u201d I\u2019d have to question whether this is true or not. As someone that is retired military as well as a former defense contractor, I know that a huge portion of that privatized force are former military members. As a result, private companies focus on \u201cculture fit,\u201d emphasize teams that get along, and look for people who already have the necessary skills, all of which helps reinforce existing segregation patterns. The first part of this is true (IME) but the last part\u2026 not so much. Those private companies tend to focus on \u201cmilitary culture fit\u201d. Their teams have to get along with and understand those military members they are working with. If there is segregation it tends to be more \u201cmilitary/veteran vs. outside civilian\u201d segregation. (That doesn\u2019t so much apply to the aircraft factory or tank/truck factory but those functions were always outsourced.) But on the main thrust of your column here\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the other comments mentioned social capital and that triggered thoughts of Prof. Robert Putnam\u2019s book Bowling Alone. It is possible that, despite the best intentions of the system creators in the digital realm, they simply enhanced the trends he was already seeing and sped up the loss of social capital.
