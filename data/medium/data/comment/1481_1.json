{"name": "1481_1", "child": "", "content": "Diem, I read the paper, I never watch TV. Haven\u2019t had a TV (for TV service) in thirty years. I have had a \u2018panel\u2019 in the house for the last six years, for console gaming (Nintendo Wii), BluRay for movies, and recently a Roku for streaming. Mostly for the entertainment of other family members, I still don\u2019t watch it much, other than occasionally watching a movie or playing a round of Mario Kart with the kids. The main point is, I have not watch commercial TV in decades. I just don\u2019t like the content. The newspaper lets me choose what to read. I also listen to some news on public radio stations. So basically, turn off your TV. Limit your content consumption. Take back your time, and your mind. ", "title": "", "parent": "1481", "creatorid": "40be379db07", "id": "72f9e0773a14"}
