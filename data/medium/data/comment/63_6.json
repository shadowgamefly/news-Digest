We\u2019ve said that we will try at some point to have a website, and each member will have a place where to showcase his work, and I really like your idea of having it as a GitHub repository. In our case, it\u2019s very important this person to person interaction. It\u2019s easier to build a relationship with another person when you are face to face. Also, it\u2019s easier to give and receive help this way. We have tried to have a Slack channel and a Facebook group chat, but I see them as failed experiments, I would say that the weekly meetings are the glue for our group. As I\u2019ve said, not constant glue, because not everybody is present all the time. Keep up the work and don\u2019t give up, yoy just have to find what works for you! Please let me know if I can be of further help! ", "creatorid": "90310716daef", "title": "", "parent": "63", "child": "", "name": "63_6"}
