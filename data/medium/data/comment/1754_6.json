{"name": "1754_6", "child": "", "content": "If you want to be a writer, than first and foremost you must to write for yourself. You write because you have so many ideas inside your heart that you would suffocate unless you let them out on the page. You write to calm your mind. To express creativity. To process problems. Writing is a passion craft. And like any passion, you do it because it\u2019s a part of you, not a platform for \u2018likes\u2019 or shares or publication. HOWEVER..if you do publish, isn\u2019t it enough that only a few read it? Even if you only impacted one person with your words, isn\u2019t that fantastic? And if you keep going, writing day by day, week by week, you will likely connect to more and more people and hone your craft. But you have to start with the mindset that you are writing for youself. I write many poems and short stories and letters that few, if no one sees. I do it only for the sole purpose of creation. It is a meal I make to feed myself. Only every once in a while do I make a larger portion for a dinner party.\u00a0: ). I hope this helps. Best of luck. ", "title": "", "parent": "1754", "creatorid": "cf3159597b9", "id": "b81dd82d72a"}
