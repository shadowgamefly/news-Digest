First of all, like I mentioned in the article, the followers are not spammers or any kind of fake accounts, it\u2019s just like you connected to people who really care for your feed\u00a0;) Yes, I thought about that too. I mean, this was actually just a little side project which turned into something I wanted to share. There is a lot of room for improvements. E.g. I could just reverse engineer the requests send for liking commenting etc. (there already is a library for that). That would make it way less error prune. The first idea was to get a bunch of free goodies and maybe even some free food (worked).I\u2019ll build a blog next and place some ads to check if it could even generate some money, we\u2019ll see.
