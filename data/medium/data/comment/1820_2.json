It\u2019s especially interesting to see how perspectives change as the creators mature from the young hotshots to older veterans. Often times, these articles focus on what sells (because Marvel or DC pushes it hard), regardless of the quality. But these kind of articles add depth to the comics landscape, especially for people who may only know the very basics. I know we\u2019re going to get a lot of Patriots, NBA and Trump articles on this site\u2026that\u2019s just how it is. But keep throwing these kinds articles out there and I\u2019ll keep reading them. ", "title": "", "parent": "1820", "creatorid": "2df2367bc02a", "id": "26c1d082419c"}
