{"name": "594_1", "child": "", "content": "\u201cApple has lost control of the narrative.\u201d I don\u2019t know. Reviews of its recent releases are overwhelmingly positive. Their adverts are quirky, endearing, and upbeat. High-end product placement in visual media keeps the Apple logo in the public eye and mind. Customer satisfaction is stellar, insuring loyalty repurchasing, and the brand is aspirational, eroding competitor market share. The narrative that Apple is doomed (and its myriad subplots) may seem the dominant story overheard in roadhouse bragging contests over cheap ale and peanut shells. There are always secluded alleys where dread hangs in the air like stiffening laundry. The narrative is a patchwork of FUD, busted expectations, bile, and stock price manipulation\u200a\u2014\u200aa grubby blanket that tries to smother the truth: that Apple is golden. But, one may protest, the narrative is supported by Facts! I say, Facts point the finger; statistics show the full hand.
