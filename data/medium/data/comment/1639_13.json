{"name": "1639_13", "child": "", "content": "Great post, Tim. For a while, Facebook did flag stories that were likely hoaxes, and would post a \u201cRecommended story\u201d underneath that linked out to Snopes. I haven\u2019t seen one of those in a while, so they may have ceased doing it\u2026or I just don\u2019t have enough hoaxes in my personal feed. (See: here, from Jan 2015, with screenshot\u2014 a tacit acknowledgement that there was a \u201cfake news\u201d problem almost 2 years ago; here, 2014, specifically focusing on \u201csatire\u201d) But you said something else interesting in here, that I think needs to be further examined in the context of this topic: \u201cMost people would find the FBI to be an authoritative source.\u201d In our examinations of the social media behavior of conspiracist groups focused on individual policies (rather than partisan politics), what we find time and time again is that fundamental distrust in the authority of \u201cmainstream\u201d or \u201cgovernment\u201d sources is precisely the driving force behind their impetus to share these types of propaganda. The anti-vax movement, for example, firmly believes that there is a vast conspiracy at the CDC to cover up the smoking gun linking vaccines to autism\u00a0; any CDC or related government-health data saying otherwise is lies. The mainstream perception that the CDC is an authoritative voice is exactly what they are trying to dispel in their extensive \u201ccitizen journalism\u201d social-media efforts on Twitter and Facebook. We\u2019ve seen this in other groups as well, focused on the EPA, the IRS, the Federal Reserve, etc. Levels of trust in institutions are at record lows. The idea that there can be an authoritative source is what is under attack by the groups that are mostly likely to share this type of content\u200a\u2014\u200athe media is biased, the government is lying, \u201cthey don\u2019t want you to see this!\u2019, etc. Google has an advantage over Facebook and Twitter because they can authoritatively rank content in such a way that does not feel like someone is being personally \u201ccensored\u201d when the algorithm choses not to amplify their share; on Facebook and Twitter the experience is much more firsthand and direct. So this is why we need to push back more when Facebook and Twitter say things like \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d, even if the idea of being an \u2018arbiter of truth\u2019 is initially uncomfortable, there are better ways to address the issue of propaganda than what we have now.
