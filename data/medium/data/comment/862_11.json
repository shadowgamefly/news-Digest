{"name": "862_11", "child": "", "content": "This is a heart felt and true article. It hits upon the very thing that most men suffer from. The absent father son relationship. As you said sure moms try to fill the gap but deep inside of us we know something\u2019s amiss. We blame ourselves sometimes we learn to not love as deeply as we should because it opens us up to the first cut which we try so hard to forget. No one understands except other men that have had that same experience. We try to hard to make sure our kids don\u2019t even know about that flawed empty place or space that resides within our unconsciousness. So we make a mental map to be there for them to attend as many things and functions with them as possible. Sure we prove our love for them and we build million dollar bonds with them. But the thing is even when we love them we still question our own ability to be loved. That one relationship that one false start leaves a mark on a man that he will wear a lifetime. The only way to heal it is to talk about it and reveal it to others. If you think this is a joke ask any man what time his father got home from work and you will see his whole demeanor change right before your very eyes. It\u2019s something about being around a man and not having a father son relationship with him. Not to create an excuse for them but most men are doing what was done to them so how could they help you when in the midst of it all they are brutally flawed also.
