{"name": "696_1", "child": "", "content": "The best UI developers I\u2019ve met, always have the user\u2019s experience in mind. As someone who went to school for design, started working out of college as a UX Designer / UI developer, and then transitioned to a full-time UI developer, this a 100% reasonable role. I\u2019m not the first one to make the transition, by a long shot. When I was wearing both the designer & developer hats, a \u201cUX developer\u201d would have been an apt description. Even now, I still pay close attention to the user\u2019s experience and work closely with the full time researchers and designers. I often make suggestions on how things could work, and many times those suggestions become part of the product. I even spend a lot of time thinking about the user experience of my fellow developers during their work. ", "title": "", "parent": "696", "creatorid": "6090bf1b9329", "id": "156916fb5b7d"}
