{"content": "How about trust none of them and just watch a movie. Given that there are as many opinions about a movie as there as people watching them, what one person/site says shouldn\u2019t change your opinion. \u201cCult Classics\u201d generally get bad reviews, people still enjoy them. Game of Thrones catches a lot of criticism for not being true to the books despite even the AUTHOR saying time and again not to compare the two. Ghost in the Shell recently released to what I\u2019ve seen as pretty mixed reviews, but again most people that have enjoyed it said to view it as a Stand Alone (Complex) and not compare it to the original. What I see a lot is that people don\u2019t understand that the majority of \u2018big name\u2019 reviews are paid for in at least some manner. Either they got the product for free, or they were outright paid to do the review. Because people are human, this colors their perception. Hard to take a review seriously when truly bad products are given \u201c6/10\u201d scores. Numbers mean nothing\u2026 I know especially for game reviews/reviewers there are a lot of good videos on why you should take every review with a huge grain of salt. There\u2019s also a lot of undisclosed sponsored reviews as well\u200a\u2014\u200awhich while illegal, is also irresponsible of the reviewer. It\u2019s gotten to the point where the sarcasm is palpable in the video when some of them do a sponsored review, just staring at the camera saying \u201cThis. was. paid. for.\u201d It\u2019s all good data, but when you\u2019re trying to quantify a subjective opinion, you\u2019ve already lost. I tend to trust reviews based on more technical aspects of something rather than whether they believe a movie/game/book was \u201cgood\u201d. Poor writing can often be excused for a good story. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200aHarry Potter was written for pre-teens, adults still enjoyed the story. EDIT: As an example: http://deadline.com/2016/12/will-smith-collateral-beauty-lowest-box-office-opening-rotten-tomatoes-1201873153/ This article lists a few problems with the review system. Further information can be attained by looking at Steam game reviews and how negative PR from a Developer unrelated to the game itself can kill a product\u2019s sales. Just because a critic thinks the movie is bad, doesn\u2019t mean YOU will. I enjoyed the Matrix Movies, I know a lot of people that think I\u2019m wrong.
