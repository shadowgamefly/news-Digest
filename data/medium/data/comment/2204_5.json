I also recently admit to myself that I enjoy and am quite good at learning but rather suck at working. I have a history of hopping from different fields of work and studying different things sometimes because I don\u2019t particularly enjoy a type of work or I found myself falling behind at work. It becomes almost like a sickness that I\u2019d want to avoid but couldn\u2019t. However, I actually find MOOC a powerful tool and alter our educational style much (for the better) compared to traditional schooling. Do I really want to spend thousands of dollars at a \u201creputable\u201d overseas college (plus the extra living costs) only to find out later that I don\u2019t like this subject or I\u2019m not really good in this field, if you could find an online course for a fraction of the cost (or even free) and is held from a similar, if not more, reputable college and study whenever you like at home? Well, it\u2019s a debate for another day (traditional vs online schooling; and I\u2019m not totally bashing traditional schooling). Despite my experience, I still find continual learning quintessential if you want to succeed in life. It\u2019s not hard to tell, from observation or from other readings that one quality of successful people is curiosity and therefore they are always learning on the go. However, your point is still valid. Learning without practising would get you nowhere and I\u2019m throwing that bad habit out of the window (it takes a lot of self-awareness and discipline to do that).
