That seems easy to do with minimal prototyping (just make a tag cloud for links, tag some stuff you like, write some blog posts and tag/arrange those\u2026 (Does wikipedia have an official way to browse by tags? I would really like something like that. Please make that, some crazy person with lots of free time.)). Note how a search engine is not very helpful for \u201cI just want to find new stuff\u201d. I think it is significantly useful to be able to find relevant stuff even when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re searching for. What other kinds of search intents are there that aren\u2019t being used? Like, search by phrase (search engine), search by function or goal (playlist, series, e-course), search by relatedness (tags), search by authorship or recommendation (user), search by similarity to other stuff I like (recommendation algorithm)...
