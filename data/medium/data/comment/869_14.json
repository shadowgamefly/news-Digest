In 2014 according to the FBI, 90% of black homicide victims were killed by other black people. Honestly, this is where the protesting should be. Why are we allowing POC to kill each other? Why are we doing nothing to fix the crime in these places? Because instead we chose war with the system. But it is not the system killing POC. So tell me who black lives really matter to if POC are out there killing each other? Pepsi is right. Everyone just needs to sit back and look at the facts. Many of those being names on the protest signs have been criminals. They did not respect the law and they did not respect the cops. Meanwhile, You have children being caught in drive by crossfires. Children killed in cold blood in retaliation for another\u2019s actions. This is what needs to be protested. This shouldn\u2019t be happening.
