Reach out to others yea, make connections yes, make strong boundaries to keep yourself emotionally safe too. I have the deepest compassion for all who suffer in any way at all, been there done that got the T shirt written the books too, but I also know that the only way out of suffering, including suffering loneliness, is to do the work on yourself through which ever route you find most valuable. I found mindfulness about 30 yrs ago and never looked back and I reach out to others all the time still but I have learned to keep a careful measure on what I let in and what i keep at a slightly greater distance in my life or I am useless to anyone if I am burned out. Buddha was the first really major self help guru ever, and he never took anybody on personally and he told them how to be happy and fulfilled in life and then let them get on with it, he did not rescue people and he did not dictate to them that they should sort themselves out but he gave them the choice and then moved on. Most people don\u2019t recognise their own desperation until it has got them into some unhappy places, then they might wake up to it. Research shows clearly that loneliness is a perception, a state of mind most of all, a judgement, a non- acceptance of where you are in your own life and a lack of recognition that this too will change, especially if you are prepared to change yourself first.
