{"name": "219_21", "child": "", "content": "I wrote about this in a piece called About You, Me, and Us and in it, I called this the \u201cMe, Me, Me Generation.\u201d In his beautiful, hilarious novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, Joshua Ferris has a character, rather a Luddite, who refers to his phone as his \u201cme machine.\u201d As the family \u201cphotographer,\u201d I find that behind the lens, capturing the moments, you are also missing them. So I do a perfunctory few snaps, then put the camera away. When I have gone on Facebook, I see photos from a friend\u2019s \u201cday out with the kids\u201d or one time, a friend who went to Europe last fall, and she had \u201cselfies\u201d of her and her husband as they toured all the best cities. She asked her Facebook friends: \u201cThose of you who have been to Paris, help me! Where should we go/what should we do next?\u201d I have never been to Europe\u200a\u2014\u200aParis is a dream of mine that might not ever be realized. As everyone told her the \u201cbest places\u201d to go, I commented with: \u201cPut your phone away and experience the city. Smell it. Feel how different the air is on your face. You don\u2019t need \u201cus\u201d to be there with you. Touch the cold metal of the Eiffel Tower. Walk historical paths. Run your hand along the stone at Notre Dame Cathedral. That\u2019s what I think you should do.\u201d No \u201clikes\u201d on my post. Imagine that.\u00a0:) You can\u2019t \u201cbe in the moment\u201d when you are objectively recording the moment for an audience, presenting it as your own personal reality show. Needles to say, I\u2019m not on FB much, (only for author duties and such). When I spend time with my granddaughter, I am the only one of her grandparents who doesn\u2019t have a zillion photos of her with me, enjoying our adventures on social media. But that\u2019s not why we go on adventures, she and I. We go on them to create memories in the most important places\u200a\u2014\u200awithin each other. Forgive the SSP links, but it\u2019s nice to find a thoughtful writer, and it\u2019s even nicer when they find me. Thank you for writing this\u200a\u2014\u200aPeace ", "title": "", "parent": "219", "creatorid": "19d8ca62571f", "id": "be930bd7630b"}
