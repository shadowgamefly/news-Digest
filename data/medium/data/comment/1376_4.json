{"name": "1376_4", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for reading and for your feedback, as always, Ron. I certainly appreciate your readership and your always thoughtful responses. It is always naive to expect honesty from anyone, especially politicians or media members. But I believe that if we stop demanding it\u200a\u2014\u200afor even a second\u200a\u2014\u200awe are going to pay for our lack of vigilance. I think I am probably not as naive as you think I am. I have little hope that asking people to do the right thing will result in their responding to it. But I still believe in doing it. Accountability is a bit in the teeth of a wild horse\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not going to make a wild horse a tame one; but it\u2019s going to do a better job of keeping it on course than letting it have its head (forgive me if my analogy is showing off my ignorance of horses\u200a\u2014\u200acity girl here). If we publicly resign ourselves to being deceived, we will only be getting what we deserve when we get duped good and hard. People in power have a tendency to take things as far as the public will let them. So no\u200a\u2014\u200aI do not expect this piece to make much difference. But I do believe that it is an appropriate response to someone in the media who is bragging that he will let our President get away with lying as long as it serves his purposes. Check and balances. Always checks and balances. You and me are a part of that, too. ", "title": "", "parent": "1376", "creatorid": "9acfdebe5f8b", "id": "1dafac45aec5"}
