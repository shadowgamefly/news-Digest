I wept quietly as I read it, most especially because I was so touched by the depth of your compassion, and by the wisdom within your insights. Your chronological youth is offset by the beautiful old soul within you. I have much in common with the old lady in your story. And I too am unsure if I will ever again see or hear from my offspring. Both my daughter and son inherited their father\u2019s mental health issues; both have spent time as aggressive patients within in-patient mental health wards. I\u2019ve had to set boundaries using legal means in the past, and they haven\u2019t liked it. While I have to keep myself safe, I miss them and love them. (But seeing them unexpectedly would probably scare me to death, given their previous violence toward me.) So, reading your story stirred a great deal within me. Thanks for writing, and for being such a kind person. Namast\u00e9 ", "name": "2212_1", "id": "7114f70daec5"}
