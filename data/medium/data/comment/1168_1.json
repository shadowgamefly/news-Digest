If I\u2019m being perfectly honest I would say that I probably haven\u2019t yet gotten far enough into the sabbatical for this to become a major problem since I haven\u2019t had a lot of inbound requests. In terms of saying \u201cno\u201d to myself though\u200a\u2014\u200abecause let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s probably the most important thing\u200a\u2014\u200aa few quick things I\u2019ve found to be helpful so far: Forcing myself to articulate how something is working towards a broader goal of mine before doing it. Not just \u201cis this aligned with my goals\u201d but \u201cwhat is the mechanism by which doing this helps me achieve my goal\u201d. Sometimes I realize I can\u2019t answer that question and then it gets dropped from the todo list.Time-boxing traps. I talked a little bit about this in the post, but if there is something you know has the potential to take you off course, but you think it might be valuable, you can at least time box it so you don\u2019t invest too much into it.Prioritizing physical and mental health. A huge part of taking a sabbatical\u200a\u2014\u200afor me at least\u200a\u2014\u200ais recharging. So I try to do something specifically for health and happiness almost every day. This lets me do some of those things that are fun, interesting and beneficial and not have to worry about them being \u201cproductive\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI know I\u2019m doing them for myself and my health and that makes them worthwhile.
