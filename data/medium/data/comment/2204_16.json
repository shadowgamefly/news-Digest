As if you read my diary\u00a0:P In the \u2018old\u2019 days (eighties and nineties),\u00a0\u2026 there was no internet, you bought a book, but.. mostly, you fiddled something together. That had disadvantages also, because\u2026 you made something, and\u2026 then what, showed it to your friends or\u2026 it was just a \u2018nice thing you made\u2019\u00a0\u2026 Look at photography, most photo\u2019s in the \u2018 old\u2019 days, stayed in your (real) photo album, only to show perhaps on birthdays or show it to family who where already trying to escape another \u2018he\u2019s gonna show his photo\u2019s of his journeys again\u2026\u2019 Now,\u2026 you can pick up every information, can join hundreds of groups of \u2018people who think or do the same\u2019, which can give you way more opportunities to go ahead, share stuff, ask stuff\u00a0\u2026 but indeed, it\u2019s also overwhelming, perhaps so overwhelming, you block out.\u00a0There is offcourse a uge advantage too\u2026 you can reach more people, share it with all the world, and.. you can look what other people are doing\u2026. new ideas spread way faster then 30 years ago. THis has offcourse a downside that it goes so fast, some ideas don\u2019t get enough time to develop. You see this with Kickstarter projects.\u00a0I\u2019m into VR and 360 degree video lately\u2026 on Kickstarter you see a bunch of 360 camera\u2019s popping up\u2026 I backed some, but\u2026 the development takes \u2018too long\u2019, since, the \u2018normal companies\u2019 producing those too already, most kickstarter project are over run with bigger companies very fast, making their design already \u2018ancient\u2019 the time the kickstarter project is ready.You see that in drones also. Most kickstarter projects failed. 2 years ago, some small companies where on kickstarter, with \u2018object avoiding systems\u2019, \u2018 follow me\u2019 options\u2026 now, DJI has those standard on drones, way cheaper and way better. This fast technological progression, is nice, but\u2026 can enhance procrastination, because, the moment you start with something, a newer tech or method is already out there! So\u2026 you hardly get the time to learn stuff the \u2018normal\u2019 way. While most new stuff, if you never used it before, will have a steep learning curve, meaning, you need a lot of time to master it, or\u2026 you have to find a way to discover which parts of are only good for you. Example: I want to learn 3D animation again. In the nineties, you had 2\u20133 programs, which\u00a0\u2026 did the basic animation stuff. Programs like 3D Studio where relatively small. That ment that you hit the maximum potential of the program, quit fast. nowadays\u2026. programs are uge, massive amount of option and possibilities, which, makes it daunding to start. To much possibilities and options enhance procrastination. ", "name": "2204_16", "id": "cb3671d31f5c"}
