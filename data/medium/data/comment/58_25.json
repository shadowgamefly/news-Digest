Last night, home alone, I thought I\u2019d get into the spirit of Lent ( 40 days before Easter. ) so I began listening on YouTube to \u201cLent \u2013 St Thomas Aquinas\u201d Now I only reached the 30 minute point in the 2.5 hr piece, however this first section has detail on the merits of fasting. Reading your piece on the merits of fasting from cussing it is as if Thomas\u2019s 1270AD piece on fasting from food would be the next step in building ones willpower. Love your work.
