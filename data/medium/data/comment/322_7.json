I was able to write four to five hours most days as a reporter. I now log about an hour each day. But my experiences as a teacher breathe life into my stories. I no longer take the time I have to write for granted. I also spend much more time in the idea phase of the craft, which has kept me from staring at a blank screen once I sit down to create a story. I feel less pressure now. Having another skill truly is beneficial. ", "title": "", "parent": "322", "creatorid": "fb574d0a8cc5", "id": "21db2f37600a"}
