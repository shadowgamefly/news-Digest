But MVP is for best individual statistical performance, so even if The Brow averaged 40-20 next year yet still didn\u2019t even make the playoffs, that\u2019s an all-time great MVP season. And Westbrook\u2019s triple-dub year is a no-brainer. ", "child": "", "parent": "31", "title": "", "creatorid": "e6435bb9ace6", "name": "31_20", "id": "8f69445f1574"}
