I was traveling the world with him through GeeksonaPlane as far back as 2009 to China, Singapore, Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Israel, Jordan and Dubai\u200a\u2014\u200ahe invested in those places, and he\u2019s now in Africa as I write this. I remember when people thought his philosophy was crazy, but I\u2019ve seen all those entrepreneurial hubs outside the US, never mind just Silicon Valley, and I believe Y Combinator doesn\u2019t deserve all the glowing praise you gave it in your story, since it is late to the game. Yes, I\u2019m biased. When you\u2019ve watched McClure roam the globe almost alone for the better part of a decade, being dismissed as crazy by the guys in the checked shirts with the gray hair because he\u2019s in a tshirt and flipflops, you are bound to be biased:-) ", "title": "", "parent": "426", "creatorid": "13472ffabfc1", "id": "6e62c464d559"}
