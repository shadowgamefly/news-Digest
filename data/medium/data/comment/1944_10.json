As a White person (I\u2019m feeling disgruntled about Canada\u2019s 150th and its blatant gut punch to reconciliation.. its like inviting everyone to your birthday but only letting half the people eat cake. Oh wait that is what they are doing. And pretending they aren\u2019t. Oh my god In 5hrs I\u2019m going to feel disgusted about my country. The epic one year of celebration and hypocrisy is upon us. I digress.) I thank you for making me feel uncomfortable. I encourage any White people ignorant about history, even their own, to go to the library and learn something uncomfortable. That is the only way we can make North America a comfortable place to live. It\u2019s a start at least \ud83d\udc9e My great grandma was American. But we never shared stories of her life or struggles. Or anything for that matter. Just rumours and secrets and toxic energies. Reading this made me wonder why. Sorry for the rant. Lots on my mind.
