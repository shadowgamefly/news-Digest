Always keep your teammates with you\u00a0, keep them motivating\u00a0, cause the secret that makes common people achieve uncommon result is team work. Make them realise alone I can do little\u00a0, together we can achieve great things. Poornima\u00a0, As you said when their heads are down just ask them why they followed you\u00a0, why they decided to come along with you in first place\u00a0. Just give them the difficult challenge\u00a0with limited resource, I am sure your teammates will come out of their nut shell and will work to achieve something new\u00a0. Sometimes every one needs a push in lifetime to move along to complete the task. Sometimes when your teammates become dispassionate\u00a0, just give them the time to get to the reality\u00a0, give them the break\u00a0. Belive in your teammates they will always come back for you\u00a0. Thanks Poornima Vijayashanker in first place for sharing it\u00a0. Loved reading it\u00a0. ", "name": "2314_6", "id": "adc012e1cd57"}
