{"content": "Hi, thanks for sharing your insights\u00a0:-) I am also trying to be more environmentally-discerning when buying things. My friend had previously commented that sustainability seems to be for the rich because most items are overpriced\u2026 (sweat-shop T shirts for 2 euros vs say about $20 for bamboo fabric?) Hope more social entrepreneurs come onboard to make sustainable options affordable for middle-lower class\u2026 I would also like to explore if there might be other interpretations about money\u00a0:-) e.g. happiness index in Bhutan? Should we not be thinking about success in terms of money\u00a0, but rather, redefine success and re-think development? A picture of highways and cars may mean developed infrastructure\u00a0, but it also brings traffic jams and pollution. So, by putting yourself in the flow of money, are u also putting yourself into the flow of troubles inadvertently? More money = more frustration?\u00a0:-) I think sometimes, just being a little above average would be sufficient\u2026 enough to ensure survival and occasional indulgence\u00a0:-) I am nowhere close to having millions, so I thought you might be in a better position to comment on whether it is just self-consolation on my part, or maybe having millions provides the freedom to achieve all that one wishes for? Thanks!\u00a0:-) ", "child": "", "parent": "9", "title": "", "creatorid": "3b692c98444a", "name": "9_2", "id": "95455f843c0b"}
