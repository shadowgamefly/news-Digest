In fact the Hillary supporters seem to be having the time of their lives. Outrage culture and pity-parties seem to be the most popular fashion no matter how ridiculous they are. I honestly believe that for the average \u201cprogressive,\u201d Trump winning the election was the best thing that could have happened. It would have been such an anti-climax if Clinton had won. There would have been no excuse to have marches and protests; no brave resistance: No endless tweeting about how \u201coppressed\u201d we are over our designer lattes at Starbucks; and no brownie points to be scored by preaching from the moral high-ground. When they reach old-age they will look back fondly on these days as they imagine themselves to be brave revolutionaries on the barricades. An American friend summed it up with the phrase \u201cSixties Re-enactment.\u201d It is such fun: Disclaimer: I am Russian so obviously Putin (or Donald Trump or somebody) pays me for everything I say. OK, time to get back to rigging elections now. A Russian agent\u2019s work is never done: In the USA, Hillary Clinton did most of our work for us, but the French election is proving more difficult than we had thought.
