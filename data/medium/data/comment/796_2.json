{"name": "796_2", "child": "", "content": "Great post. The uninterrupted block of work time is key. One other rule I try to live by is to not schedule meetings in the middle of what could otherwise be an otherwise uninterrupted block of time. Instead of meeting at 2 or 3PM (the worse) try just before or after lunch. Regarding working from home, I\u2019ve found that 1\u20132 days a week can work fine too, ideally when the team chooses the same days. Those tend to be my most productive days. The days in the office are when I meet face to face and collaborate on open issues. The work from home days are when I execute on them, with slack interactions as needed.
