When you say that CEOs, engineers, marketing, etc, take part in the design process, I can only agree. However, the title \u201cEveryone is a designer\u201d just reminded me of all those people in my company who know very little about typography, colors, design trends, etc, and yet allow themselves to have a say about a design, or worse, they actually try to design something. It\u2019s really exhausting to have those people around because you\u2019re too polite to tell them that their design is bad, their idea doesn\u2019t work and it take more than knowing to use InDesign or Photoshop to be a designers. To talk to these people you almost need to give them a design course. I certainly don\u2019t question that everyone has an opinion, but not everyone is a designer.
