Developers are not as interested in the watch as Apple would hope\u200a\u2014\u200atoo much effort is needed to figure out the new UX and the reward is small (user base for watch is very small to monetize). Without the \u201ckiller apps\u201d all users are left with is a fitness tracker, and for that there are other devices at a much lower price and with much longer battery life. Now that the early adopters already have an Apple Watch it\u2019s time to cross the chasm. Unfortunately I don\u2019t see Apple achieving that in the near future.
