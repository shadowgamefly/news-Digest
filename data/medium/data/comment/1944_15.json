We don\u2019t have a clue what lynching is like, or what the spectre of its possibility would feel like in our lives, ever. We don\u2019t have that history.\u201d Keep studying history. It seems that there is quite a bit of it that you missed. Also from Wikipedia: \u201cThe Tuskegee Institute has recorded 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites being lynched between 1882 and 1968.\u201d You might also look into the Johnson County War, the San Francisco Vigilance Movement and the saga of John Heath of Tombstone, AZ. While I would agree that there were more blacks lynched than whites, the idea that \u201cwe don\u2019t have that history\u201d is just plain false.
