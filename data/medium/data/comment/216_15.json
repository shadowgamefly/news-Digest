Stories like this deserve to go viral, even as they validate those of us who don\u2019t need converting. Empathy is a funny thing, is it learned or innate? Some of us have it, some of us don\u2019t. I think mine\u2019s innate. Years ago, I sat in a movie theatre and blubbered like a baby after \u201cHarry and Tonto\u201d ended. I was 25 at the time, and slightly embarrassed. But empathy served me well, when it helped guide me through the \u201cfirst deaths\u201d of my parents. Thanks for writing this. Enjoyed the cartoons too!
