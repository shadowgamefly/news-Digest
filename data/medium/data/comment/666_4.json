I took a break from writing and the Korean language in order to get settled. But now, I have begun anew. Thankfully, I have retained a lot of my Korean. Ah, so many incredible things have happened - I cannot wait to share. I am writing and I will start publishing again when I have some material saved up. Not sure where I will publish, I will have to look and see if there are any language learning blog communities on medium. It has been a pleasure catching up with you, keep creating!
