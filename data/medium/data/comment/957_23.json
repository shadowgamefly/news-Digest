{"name": "957_23", "child": "", "content": "As a black woman I get this notion. Where were you when I needed you to act. However the truth is not black and white. MILLIONS of people of women voted for HRC. Millions. Thousands of white women have been involved in activism for black folks, LGBTQ, women\u2019s rights for decades. Look at the pictures from Kings marches. There are white folks there. At the black lives matter events. There were white folks there. Were they out en masse? No. Do you have a right to be disappointed yes. My understanding is the organizers and many of the people I know who were involved did vote and are socially aware and are learning and growing everyday. Some have been marching and in the struggle for decades and I hope that they have some of your respect. 62 MILLION people voted for her. 62 million did exactly what you hoped they would do. 62 million marched to the polls. I hope we can give them space (when we are ready) to also be legitimately supportive and scared and concerned about the future. I hope we can have, when ready, more empathy and compassion than anger. Those of you calling the writer a whiner or sanctimonious I would caution you. First seek to understand. Such that even if you disagree you do so without first offending and injecting only judgement.
