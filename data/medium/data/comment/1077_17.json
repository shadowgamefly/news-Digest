I imagine, seeing numbers gave you real motivation to continue on your project. I am not really interested in Instagram itself, but the part of finding html elements and interacting with them is what I loved to read about. In my everyday job, I am forced to use TimeSheet. For lucky people who don\u2019t know what it is: it\u2019s just a tool for company to store information on what was done, when, and by who. The problem is, the tool is very irritating to use, slow, non-intuitive, taking to much time to complete simple task, and doesn't allow for any \u201csmart\u201d auto-filling of repetitive tasks. The good thing, TimeSheet UI is html based, and accessed via browser\u00a0:) So I ended up writing my own Chrome plugin, which I feed with data from Google Spreadsheet, where I keep track of my work hours and tasks. The main advantage is that I can now copy task names, descriptions and so on. Also, I can fill-in data for a whole week or even month in one place, without page reloading constantly (opposite of TimeSheet), which took ages. Plugin now does that for me, when I take my coffee break. I ended up going from 5 minutes daily, to about 2 minutes weekly. So what I basically wanted to tell you: thanks for writing about Selenium\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s exactly the tool I needed to make my automation tool transfer to python:) ", "title": "", "parent": "1077", "creatorid": "825f9d46b313", "id": "681fa0b4b234"}
