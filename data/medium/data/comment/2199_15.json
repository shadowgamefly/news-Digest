Don\u2019t you think that if you decided to quit your daily job to, p.e., start a new career in freelance photography, you will be busy as hell setting up your new biz, e-commerce, website, social media accounts, and so on? And most relevant, you won\u2019t end at a given time, but probably you will continue until \u201c exhaustion\u201d. I don\u2019t really see anybody i know working freelance takin so many 9 hours sleeps, reading in the parks and so on. This is not being freelance, this is just having 2 lazy days off your daily job with nothing to do. ", "name": "2199_15", "id": "ba7c4de8ccf2"}
