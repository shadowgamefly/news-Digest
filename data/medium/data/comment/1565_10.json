{"name": "1565_10", "child": "", "content": "Short term memory is the problem with Trump and McConnell. They treated Obama like a you know what. Now they want to be treated with respect. Waht goes around comes around. If they break the filibuster rule, the senate no longer has any more power than the House. Their ability to fund raise when they are in the minority will be zero. A senator without a filibuster power is an emperor with no clothes. Cruz made $50miollion off his filibuster while reading Dr. Suess. Democrats you have nothing to lose here. You didn\u2019t filibuster when they signed the take away money from Planned Parenthood last week. Let them screw the Senate, it will come back to haunt them in the future. You know that as soon as a liberal Supreme Court judge dies, they will appoint another conservative. I just hope that people really do show up during the 2018 election.Sadly with Gerrrymandering, Democrats have to vote at 70% or higher in Red districts to get rid of the REthuglicans. Vote Vote Vote Resist, Persist, and Vote. ", "title": "", "parent": "1565", "creatorid": "93d160cb1fb5", "id": "d1da4dbd187e"}
