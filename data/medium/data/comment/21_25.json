{"id": "9f85eb4f6da6", "content": "I feel like Tokyo Drift is underrated. It\u2019s a great bad movie on it\u2019s own and Han and Yakuza take it to the very top. I know it doesn\u2019t really fit the retconned narrative from Fast 5 on, BUT after the second movie, there\u2019s no way there are any more F&F movies without Tokyo Drift sliding its way into our hearts and then-current car culture. So it was a necessary movie. And like the first movie, it\u2019s representative of car culture, almost absurdly realistic when compared to the rest of the F&F \u2018Hollywood Hot Wheels\u2019 canon: tanks, the Rock, car flipping dune buggies, skyscraper-jumping. It should get points for that. The opening race was almost sublime in comparison to the rest of the series. ", "creatorid": "3b8c86efa1c4", "title": "", "parent": "21", "child": "", "name": "21_25"}
