{"name": "1772_17", "child": "", "content": "Being a huge fan of your work, I enjoyed this article but am not quite ready to throw media literacy out with the bathwater. I agree that it does not work when taught in a silo or as a one-off lesson. Think it needs to be served on a bed of Social-Emotional Literacy (empathy/understanding of the other), followed by Digital Citizenship (responsible use of dig. tools), then a healthy dose of Info. Literacy (to learn how things like filter bubbles happen). Finally when kids, hopefully, finally get Media Lit. lessons (news literacy, visual literacy, stereotypes, etc.), they will have a rich context to draw upon (how we try to do thru www.cybercivics.com). Then maybe, just maybe, they will become smarter consumers and producers of media than we have been. ", "title": "", "parent": "1772", "creatorid": "9e947c86f2aa", "id": "c63f75155f6c"}
