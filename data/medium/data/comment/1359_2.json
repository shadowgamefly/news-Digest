The FAKE NEWS article proves that the lamestream media is complicate in trying to take him down, because he\u2019s fighting for us not the big corporations that want to bring a NEW WORLD ORDER. The FAKE NEWS article claimed that Flynn is guilty and that\u2019s why \u201che\u201d wanted immunity. But obviously, Trump was saying that he should only \u201ctake\u201d immunity \u201cbecause\u201d of the witch hunt against our warriors that are loyal to Trump and speak the truth. If you just pulled you\u2019re head out of you\u2019re butt, you would find that your free to think for you\u2019re self, instead your being fooled. This is satire folks.
