Saying that some one is worse than a Nazi is not the same thing as praising Nazis. He never claimed that Hitler \u201cnever gassed his own people\u201d. either. He said that Germany did not use chemical weapons. Chemical weapons are ordinance used in combat. The gas chambers were not used in combat, there for they were not \u201cchemical weapons\u201d. This does not mean, nor can any reasonable person think this means that gas chambers (which of course used chemicals) were not used. This type of spin and lying is no different than what you find on Breitbart. ", "title": "", "parent": "1523", "creatorid": "4801d5e23400", "id": "a22bb9b2ed3e"}
