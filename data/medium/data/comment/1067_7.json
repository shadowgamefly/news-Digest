{"name": "1067_7", "child": "", "content": "Fantastic article. I really loved the description of finding the key metric for driving user growth. I\u2019ve seen so many companies get caught up on the vanity metrics, and sometimes it\u2019s ok for a while but at some point it leads them astray. And their teams often get confused about the relative value of the different vanity metrics. Instead of grappling with that, I advocate for a single metric that encompasses creation of value as well as growth. Sometimes it takes work to drive understanding and adoption of this, but it\u2019s worth it for the clarity it brings to everything else.
