{"name": "869_22", "child": "", "content": "Rates of reported child abuse are disproportionately high for black children. According to the Justice Department\u00a0, black children ages 12 to 19 are \u201cthree times more likely to be victims of reported child abuse or neglect.\u201d As many as 7,354 young people ages 12 to 24, most of them black, experience homelessness each year in D.C., and more than 2 million children nationwide do. In one national survey, nearly half reported intense conflict, neglect or physical harm by a family member as a major factor in their homelessness. Others experienced family instability due to unaffordable housing, or left the juvenile-justice system or the foster-care system without enough education or support to make it on their own. Research from the Administration for Children and Families shows that up to 42 percent of runaway and homeless youth are sexually abused before they leave their homes. Black children are also disproportionately likely to suffer treatment at home that\u2019s so bad that they want to flee. In 2015, black kids had the highest rate of abuse and neglect, at 14.5 per 1,000 children, compared with 8.1 per 1,000 for white children, according to the Children\u2019s Bureau, part of the Department of Health and Human Services. More than 3,600 black children in the United States have died as a result of maltreatment in the past decade, a rate three times higher than for all other racial groups. Suicide rates among elementary-age black children have nearly doubled since the 1990s, while the rates for white children have fallen, according to a 2015 report from the Journal of the American Medical Association. Oh the gall of Pepsi\u00a0! it must be responsible for the neglect and abuse of all black children in the USA too!!!!!\u2026\u2026 yeah right.
