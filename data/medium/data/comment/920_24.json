I was wondering if you were to find all the letters/numbers in the password on the first round and then use them + \u2018pasword\u2019 letters to check forward and backward. Would it be faster? For example when your password contains 10 different letters/numbers then you have a list with size of a 17(10 different letters/numbers + \u2018pasword\u2019 letters) and not a 36 anymore.
