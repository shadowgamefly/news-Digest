{"name": "592_7", "child": "", "content": "I think the Swatch Group understands that there is still a big gap in the emerging Smartwatches category that co-relates perfectly with how Swatch originally positioned itself when faced with Japanese Quartz watches\u200a\u2014\u200aAt the bottom of the pyramid. There exists a vast market for quality, affordable smartwatches based on a combination of LE chipsets & an OS that focus on what should be the core featureset of a smartwatch: A) Time & Date accuracy across timezones B) Sensors to measure Health Data C) Ability to transfer Data D) Battery life that lasts days if not a month The connected-smartwatch approach favoured by Apple/Google is an enhanced featureset for a smartwatch, which is only relevant as long as the user has a smartphone/tablet+ access to constant charging sources. I think Swatch sees an opportunity here to introduce a better designed product experience to all the owners of cheap dumb-digital watches as well as fitness bands like the ones from FitBit. FitBit will be target for the Swatch smartwatch, not the Apple Watch. Not to mention the resurgent Nokia/Withings if it can scale its existing supply-chain & distribution channels to go with its competent products.
