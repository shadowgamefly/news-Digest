{"name": "957_5", "child": "", "content": "Sorry that you feel so let down. It does suck when sometimes it\u2019s like you\u2019re shouting into a wind tunnel and then someone comes along saying essentially the same thing, but they get a megaphone. I just hope you also remember that there were those who stood with you when your voices were small. I hope you know that they are still there now, ready to march with you when you\u2019re ready. The fundamental causes you were fighting for are still worth fighting for and I hope you don\u2019t let this disappointment dishearten you forever. I don\u2019t know you, but you seem like a wonderful ally and I hope you keep shouting in the wind tunnel with the rest of us so someone can pass you the megaphone.
