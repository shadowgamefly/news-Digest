{"name": "1862_4", "child": "", "content": "Hey Steve Wilhite, great question! Peter Schroeder \ud83d\ude80 asked a similar question so I\u2019d just share my answer with you, too. To be fully transparent, we don\u2019t really have a streamlined task management workflow yet. We have been picking tools that we as individuals feel most comfortable with. Also, Trello has been working well for the blog editorial as a Kanban board while Asana feels more suitable for events planning as the task management aspect has more features. So we end up using a few tools for different purposes. I think it\u2019d be great to streamline it a little. If you have any suggestions, it\u2019d be great to hear from you, too. Hope I\u2019ve managed to answer your question. Thanks, Steve. -Alfred ", "title": "", "parent": "1862", "creatorid": "245d5483fb27", "id": "aa0551a99b6e"}
