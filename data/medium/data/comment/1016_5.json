I\u2019d suggest trying a few of these,\u00a0they\u2019ve\u00a0radically\u00a0changed\u00a0and\u00a0improved\u00a0our\u00a0process: forego hifi wireframes, prototyping with paper and pencil, whiteboards, photos, video is far faster and more collaborative.Run prototyping workshops with cross discipline team members and product stakeholders, not just designersStart with story mapping, personas and research\u00a0(also\u00a0through\u00a0group\u00a0work), have it inform both technical specs and wire framing and produce a single document with both side by side ( a big shift sometimes for your technical team members to define there spec in terms of value to the end user)Design and develop component based front end style guides that can be rapidly constructed and remixed to quickly iterate through testable front ends,Focus on small pieces or key experiences first, building multiple testable prototypes.Never work in isolationGet completely clear about the roles of ux, content and design and how the work together. If wireframes are defining the ux process in your team, there\u2019s a hell of an oppotunity to learn and grow and do more incredible work.
