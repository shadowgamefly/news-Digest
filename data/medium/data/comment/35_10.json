{"name": "35_10", "child": "", "content": "Today\u2019s players are far superior to players in the 60s, both skill-wise and athletically. Nearly everyone in today\u2019s NBA would be considered a physical freak if transported back to the 60s. Rudy Gobert wasn\u2019t even an All-Star this year. If you drop him in the NBA in 1962, he might be the MVP. And playing against these superior modern athletes, Westbrook averages 31 ppg. Take him back 50 years, give him 35 extra possessions per game, and you\u2019re telling me he\u2019ll average LESS points against smaller, less athletic defenders? Okay.
