Delays are unfortunately inevitable with most new technologies and in a world of Amazon, consumers (and media) are conditioned to expect things NOW. Question: do you believe female founders catch more heat from the media than our male counterparts? It\u2019s a discussion I\u2019ve had with female investors and founders alike and I\u2019m interested in your perspective. For example, coverage of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes feels like a witch hunt at times. While that\u2019s an extreme example and she\u2019s certainly made some seriously questionable business decisions, it\u2019s difficult as an outsider to understand if the personal slander she\u2019s had to face is fully justified by her actions\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "330", "creatorid": "fb7d3a13ad25", "id": "b12fd43e3495"}
