Absolutely, I\u2019m all for passion and totally get what you say when you say \u2018that one quality that drives one insane\u2019. We all can have that one thing that resonates with us especially, no matter what it is. In many ways this is what is known as the Tao. Our purpose, our plan, our path. This could be as simple as an ordinary job or hobby, or as \u2018extra\u2019ordinary as being a highly skilled surgeon or even a Hollywood actor. My feelings on it though are that if we are able to do that one thing with more of the \u2018no-body\u2019 rather than the desire to do it to be \u2018some-body\u2019 then we will actually enjoy it better for itself, we will do it better for ourselves and notoriously have more enjoyment when doing it. Balance is everything, just as you suggest. ", "name": "2196_14", "id": "67d82f335cdf"}
