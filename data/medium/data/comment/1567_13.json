{"name": "1567_13", "child": "", "content": "I have to say, this argument is no better than the argument about how red the map looks when colored by county. The Constitution has worked with the natural imbalance presented by the bicameral representation. The argument here can be used better to explain the imbalance of the electoral college given that one person should have one vote for the leader of our country. The people should elect the executive rather than the states. However, it is fully understandable to have both state and popular representation in the Congress. I, like many, don\u2019t always agree with the extent of the autonomy of the states, but it\u2019s insincere to claim that the states shouldn\u2019t have representation in Congress while praising states for passing legislation that we support. The fact that each state has two senators regardless of population is naturally offset by the proportional representation of the House. The real issue is that gerrymandering and voter suppression has reduced the House to strictly partisan districts rather than true popular representation. The real fight is there, not in attempting to change the representation of the Senate. ", "title": "", "parent": "1567", "creatorid": "751445840e99", "id": "b5879b57c94f"}
