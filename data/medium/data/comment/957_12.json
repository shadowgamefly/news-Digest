{"name": "957_12", "child": "", "content": "How do you think I felt on Election Day after all the work I put in? Do you really think you were alone out there working for our party\u2019s candidate? Did you not look to your left or to your right or maybe behind you? I marched yesterday to show my solidarity. It\u2019s not the first time I have had to stand up for my rights along with the rights of others. I\u2019m nearly 45 years old. Two younger white women said behind me yesterday, \u201cWhy are we doing this Grandma-style march with the same Grandma-style slogans?\u201d I turned around and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because 53% of white women voters voted for Mr. Trump.\u201d They were shocked. It\u2019s a long road. Do you think Gandhi, Dr. King, John Lewis, Gloria Steinem, Angela Davis, Daisy Elliott, or others would have given up after a few marches? Change does not happen overnight. Women have only had the vote in this country since 1920. African Americans did not really have equal voting rights until the mid 1960s even though they were freed almost a century before that. You were tired. Get some rest. Recoup. Then join us again when you are ready. ", "title": "", "parent": "957", "creatorid": "204e274faf69", "id": "ca54d3cf2539"}
