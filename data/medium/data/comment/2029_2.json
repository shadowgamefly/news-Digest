Use stock photos for pennies instead of paying for fresh real photography so the website will be \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cprofessional\u201d whatever the fuck that means. Coding, \u201cloving code\u201d and working overtime \u201ccoding with passion\u201d and not getting paid so everyone will see your \u201csacrifice\u201d. So I said fuck you and stopped being that guy and I make more money on YouTube as a content creator. ", "creatorid": "858b17155a45", "name": "2029_2", "parent": "2029"}
