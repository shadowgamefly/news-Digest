{"name": "727_5", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for the message, Jay! I like your thinking and I sometimes wonder that too! I live on a one way street, the drivers often need to drive around to get me even though they are at the street corner\u200a\u2014\u200athis usually annoys me during rush hour. We can call or text the driver in that scenario (I usually call), but it would be useful if I can just tap on their location pin and send a signal to tell the driver to just wait there instead. There\u2019s a lot to look forward. I\u2019m sure by doing more user research and testing, they\u2019ll gain better understanding of user needs and implement new features with greater ease of use.
