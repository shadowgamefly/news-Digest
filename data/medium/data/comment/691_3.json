To bring change to a group of people who suffer from toxic inertia is a hard problem. I believe that several published books discuss these issues and possible solutions. Have you met great managers who energize their teams and make the impossible happen? Would you say that the companies where these managers work suffer from similar problems as you present in this article? My opinion, is that good managers are rare, but they make other people understand how to use these tools for good and not demotivation. Kanban became popular after managers started copying the tools employed in Toyota, tearing them from their original context. And although I believe that Kanban is a system that is NOT suitable for environments that are dissimilar to a mass production car factory. It got disconnected from its context in more ways than one. Managers in Toyota are more mentors than supervisors, more teachers than commanders and controllers. I have just finished reading the book \u201cZapp!\u201d and it talks exactly about why people are acting like zombies in organizations, and any change is in fact impossible. Hint: It has to do with management behavior. The book presents a recipe of how this can be changed, although it is written in the form of a fable. Another great book from the 1930-ties by Dale Carnegie also prescribes how leadership should behave vs. how you often find them acting. The book name is \u201cHow to win friends and influence people,\u201d especially the last chapter that talks about leadership provides great answers for your question.
