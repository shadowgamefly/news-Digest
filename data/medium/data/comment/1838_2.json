{"name": "1838_2", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for your insight. I have a two year old and baby due in July. Something I\u2019m learning as I write my memoir which focuses on challenges I had growing up is that my situation is unique due to my parent\u2019s divorce, mental illness, anxiety, my genetic disorder and all that fun stuff. It made growing up feel like it happened without my wanting it too (caretaker of parents) and yet as an adult I worked hard to find the joy and fun in life outside of the troubles I experienced growing up. I wish I had a childhood that was fun and exciting, full of whimsy. Yet it had moments and I cling to that when I think of how to inspire my kids to live and love life. Deeper appreciation is definitely part of that. ", "title": "", "parent": "1838", "creatorid": "1f5684bedb4c", "id": "e1460b08abbf"}
