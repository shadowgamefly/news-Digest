{"name": "1560_12", "child": "", "content": "@Dallas Dunlop, you realize the filibuster is NOT minority rule, it is to keep the majority from trampling the rights of others. I find it ironic that the right is so happy to do this, they \u201chave the majority and should get their way\u201d when in fact they do not. It is a gerrymandered House where democrats had millions more votes than the GOP but the GOP will have majority for eternity. The senate is currently a GOP majority. The president is a minority president who questionably was elected: Russia, Comey, and voter suppression in swing states. Without voter suppression, Clinton may have won the Electoral College too. But all you Trumpites are, it isn\u2019t majority, it\u2019s electoral college. We don\u2019t want CA choosing the president for the rest of us. The EC is to help the minority populations from smaller states. (The result is that real-estate is more important than anything. A CA vote is 2/3 of an ID vote). But that is okay. But now that you have cheated your way into majorities where both presidentially and congressionally democrats have more votes\u2026 you say the filibuster is minority power and not a stop gap. You all need to listen to yourselves. Right now this government is in the final stages of govt for the people by the people. Once Gorsuch is in, all branches of govt will belong to the corporations and people don\u2019t count. ", "title": "", "parent": "1560", "creatorid": "c0ad59e5ee14", "id": "8f25b0eec8ea"}
