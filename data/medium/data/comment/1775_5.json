This sounds suspiciously like a call for censorship and silencing on the last remaining platform of free-speech. All dressed up in some touchy-feely \u201cprogressive\u201d language as usual. You want hatred and intimidation to flourish in a very real way; I don\u2019t just mean some troll calling you mean names on twitter; I mean really frightening organised terror; then the first step on that road is to start tinkering with the right to free speech. People saying things that make you feel uncomfortable is the price of living in a free society and it is a very small price to pay. And as for \u201cdeath threats;\u201d Nobody can kill you or attack you over the internet. Just thought you might like to know.
