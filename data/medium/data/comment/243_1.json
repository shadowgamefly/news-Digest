Lebron James can tank his popularity with (and ratings in) Ohio by endorsing a candidate his state didn\u2019t like all that much, Kevin Durant can tank the ratings for the Western Conference finals by moving from one team to another (and no one doubts this will be the case this year). Even worse, if Lebron pulled a Barry Sanders the entire Eastern conference would be a dumpster fire. No, the NFL\u2019s issues are tiny when you realize that by embracing \u201cthe shield\u201d and reigning in individual athletes, it has inoculated itself from the most serious issues a sports league can face.
