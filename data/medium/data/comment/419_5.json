{"name": "419_5", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for this WiFi review! We just renovated our apt in NYC and WiFi was one of the biggest issues I faced. I opted to not have Cat5 installed (but should have in hindsight.) At risk was my children\u2019s Xbox, which was far enough away from the main router that updating a game or avoiding glitches in 2k17 was impossible. Mesh was at a price point I couldn\u2019t consider at the time. I have an Airport Extreme (new version) which uses multiple Airport Express to extend the signal and act as my audio routing system. Setup of the system was trial and error over weeks. You can\u2019t call TWC/Spectrum as you\u2019re not using their device (which was still setup incorrectly I finally found out!) Thanks to the Xbox and many users that have had miserable WiFi experience with their games there area a plethora of posts and videos that help you get setup. It was here I discovered the ability to set DNS servers on 8.8.8.8. I can\u2019t remember why it helps but you are absolutely right, the home-user has to become an expert in WiFi setup for them to get the best and fastest experience. I am intrigued by the Google mesh extenders and may investigate those. I also think you\u2019re right in that mesh will become something the apps will embed to help with signal distribution. During the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong the app Firechat became big as it was a mesh chat network that allowed them to communicate in a manner that didn\u2019t rely upon cell or other transmission networks. They just needed enough phones connected. Thanks again for the post as it was very helpul. ", "title": "", "parent": "419", "creatorid": "8e3045d8184d", "id": "24083e1849ce"}
