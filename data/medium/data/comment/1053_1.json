{"name": "1053_1", "child": "", "content": "For the little experience I have had doing interviews, at least partially, I am really baffled when I hear about how others do interviews. Nobody except people doing some particular kinds of research, working in AI, or improving core algorithms will ever need to manually sort a list. Everybody working anywhere has the internet, a repl, and all the time in the world. Filtering out people who don\u2019t actually know how to code is a one-question thing. Often, we do that step by looking at their GitHub, or their personal blog, or what they\u2019ve been tweeting about. Sometimes they don\u2019t have these things, and that\u2019s alright, we just ask them questions. This is absolutely obvious. And yet it seems we are in a minority of companies to do that. It\u2019s mind-boggling. After the basic aptitude for coding (for coding positions! Imagine companies requiring stupid CS problems of their non-coding staff\u2026), the only two important things in a candidate is whether they can learn, and whether they fit well in the team. These are the hard things. They\u2019re also the people things. People are hard to figure out. In comparison, technical skills are stupidly easy. So, as an industry, we should focus on people, not skills. ", "title": "", "parent": "1053", "creatorid": "511c5e24334e", "id": "e60cf973b7eb"}
