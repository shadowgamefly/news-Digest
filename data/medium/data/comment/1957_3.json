It became impossible and that\u2019s why it makes me so upset when editors do not get that and still behave as in good old days when you had to pitch, but you were also more decently paid. I\u2019m not talking just about Medium here, it\u2019s the same everywhere. There are very few writers around who can still make it. Mostly, one has to be an expert who also writes (the route you took and suggest) or you have to sell your soul and do content marketing, but that doesn\u2019t pay that well either, and the fees keep dropping there as well. So what I\u2019m asking the editors is to stop fooling around with the pitching game and start rewarding posts without burdening writers any more than necessary. It\u2019s not nice and it makes more sense to write for free and use the posts to promote yourself. What Medium is trying to do lately gives me a gimps of hope, though. I think Ev Williams understands this problem and is trying to find a solution for writers like me and many others here. I sincerely hope he succeeds.
