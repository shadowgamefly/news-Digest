Whatever the OS\u2019s qualities, if the Swatch (Tissot?) is to interface well to the IoT, it will need to either dictate or play friendly with dozens of other companies\u2019 products. SwatchOS will start in distant third place (at very best) in the IoT game, so dictating APIs that others will embed is ridiculously impossible. So the question remains, as it is for Apple & Android, how many IoT products will produce apps or modules for the SwatchOS programs. Does Swatch have a lick of experience developing a software platform? Do they have some shortcut to success that eludes (disrupts) the established players, also eluded the formerly-established players (eg, RIM, Microsoft & Nokia) and finally, has eluded a long list of third-party players in related areas\u2026General Magic, anyone? It will be a huge event if they somehow pull off the trick. While we\u2019re in the land of incredibility, has Swatch laid out HOW these phones will let you tweak the thermostat on your way back from vacation or alert you when your security cam detects motion by the back door at night? That\u2019s normally in the province of app designers, not simply OS creators. The whole enterprise seems cockeyed. It seems designed to reinforce @Asymco\u2019s observation that companies lead shorter and shorter lives, as changes to tech and economics creatively destroy all of established companies resources. Including founders\u2019 savvy business planning, investment in processes, brands, etc. ", "title": "", "parent": "592", "creatorid": "2dfc7a1e2306", "id": "48bd4f93845"}
