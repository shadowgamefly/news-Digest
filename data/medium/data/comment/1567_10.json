{"name": "1567_10", "child": "", "content": "Does your math account for the number of eligible voters. Those who voted against those Senator\u2019s elections? Abstentions? No. It does not. Here are some numbers for California. In 2016, they didn\u2019t have a Republican on the ticket. California\u2019s Senate primaries can have that result. The result was 61.60 to 38.54 with a turnout a little higher at 12,244,170 from 19,411,771 eligible voters. And the state population was 39,250,017. Harris won with 61.60%, but how many votes was that? 7,542,753. Out of only 12,2 million who showed up, out of a state of some 39.2 million people. That\u2019s not even half. Not even close. And 7,167,601 didn\u2019t even care enough to vote though they could have. Almost as many eligibles abstained as voted for the winner. Add the number of non-eligibles who could have registered and it\u2019s a majority. And in 2012 Feinstein (D) and Emken (R) had similar results. 2012 was 62.5 to 37.5 with a turnout a little higher at 12,578,511 from 18,245,970 eligible voters. And the state population was about a million people lower at 38.6 million. Here\u2019s the math. Feinstein\u2019s number of voters was 7,864,624. That\u2019s who chose her. 8 million of 38 million rounded up. That\u2019s who she \u201crepresents.\u201d That and her campaign donors not matter where they are. (And that goes for the entire Senate.) Of course using that method that will make the GOP\u2019s numbers across the nation smaller as well. That doesn\u2019t bother me a bit. And it will be a hell of a lot more accurate than this shitshow you\u2019ve thrown together. Why should we count Harris and Feinstein as Senators with all of the state\u2019s population behind them? When they only recieved about 8 million out of 39 million? The answer you must give while you all tuck in your chin and frown is this. \u201cWell no, in our system the Senators represent the whole state. Based on who wins according to state law, so they have a right to count the whole population once they win. Right?\u201d Right? Yes, right! Absolutely right. They do represent the whole state. The legitimacy of the system that you use to give them representation of the entire population of their state? It\u2019s the same legitimacy that underpins the legislative system of the US Federal Governement, including the Great Compromise. All those numbers up there? They\u2019re bullshit. The same crap you are trying to shovel. Exactly the same. In the system we have, 2 Senators elected from each state make up one house of a bi-cameral legislature. Little states get some protection against big states in the Senate. And big states take their advantage in the House where they get more members. It\u2019s a compromise. Forgot what that means? Look it up. Hint: it\u2019s the oil that makes the machinery of government possible. Those numbers you thew in Google Spreadsheet? The disparity they show? It\u2019s on purpose. It\u2019s a working compromise as old as the country. Stop passing off one of the greatest features of the US legislature as a bug. It\u2019s a feature. And you know it is. Which is why you pretending to have discovered a discrepancy is so disingenuous. Thinkprogress? Sure. Yes. I love progress. But for Effs\u2019 effing sake. THINK first.
