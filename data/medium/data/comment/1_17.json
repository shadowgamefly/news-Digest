{"name": "1_17", "child": "", "content": "Hi Daniel, you are absolutely right, we should get everyone in the company on board with designing better products and services. And yes a lot of people other than the people holding the title \u201cDesigner\u201d do important design work and make decissions that affect the overall product experience. And yes we Designers should team up with them and teach them about Design so they can make better design decissions. Here\u2019s the *but*: if I add two and two together, am I a Mathematician? If I fix my sink, am I a Plumber? If I as an Interaction Designer make software engineering decissions on a daily basis, am I an Engineer? The answer is no. I don\u2019t call myself Engineer, Plumber or Mathematician, because I didn\u2019t study these subjects and because I don\u2019t hold a title saying that. What I did do is study design for six years and what I have is a title saying just that. Design is a job just like Engineering. And I don\u2019t see you writing \u201ceveyone is an Engineer\u201d or \u201ceveryone is a Business Economist\u201d. And as long as that\u2019s not the case then yes, everyone is doing design work, but no, not everyone is a Designer.
