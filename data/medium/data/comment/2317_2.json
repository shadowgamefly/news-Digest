I\u2019m working for a company who is keeping salaries below the 10th percentile of income and the morale and motivation is getting worse. Income/salaries are being brought up in company-wide meetings (a rebranding meeting) and many people feel undervalued after our company was sold to a Fortune 500 where owners were well compensated due to the larger profit margins created from paying employees a much lower rate than industry standards. I agree, once you\u2019re within the 25th-75th percentile range of compensation the income becomes less important but if you\u2019re sitting there in the bottom of the barrel it\u2019s a real problem.
