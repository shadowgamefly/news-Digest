However, my question is not about airlines though I support #neverflyunited. It is about humanity and decency. There was a time when people stood up to support one another. What happened to that? Why did all the other passengers simply sit there and watch this horrific thing happen? I am not saying that they should have fought the security guards. They could have stood up and walked off the plane in solidarity\u200a\u2014\u200aall including the First Class passengers. Then United would have had the privilege to fly its own staff and give them the choice of any seat on the plane. Try it people. As long as you are willing to take shit, shit shall be dished out to you. That is the law of nature. United didn\u2019t invent it, it\u2019s there, like gravity. United doesn\u2019t enforce it. We do. By our silence in the face of injustice, we permit and support injustice. Remember the man who said, \u2018When the truth must be spoken, silence is culpable\u2019? He too was American. You want to make America great again? Great idea. But then you have to get up and do something. You can\u2019t simply sit in your seat with your fingers crossed and mumble, \u2018Thank God that didn\u2019t happen to me.\u2019 If you do that, one day it will. It surely will as the sun rises from the East. ", "creatorid": "653e7df71c6c", "title": "", "parent": "11", "child": "", "name": "11_19"}
