{"name": "30_5", "child": "", "content": "The best thing about this year\u2019s MVP debate is how it exposes all the bball idjits. People act like this is somehow close or debatable, but Westbrook is handily playing the greatest bball right now. Only dinks like Simmons would rather boast about a more efficient usage metric with a marginally superior team win percentage. I thought he was some great historian of the game, but he doesn\u2019t recognize that Russ is not just averaging a trip-dub, but is also leading the entire league in scoring too. The Thunder might be the worst team in the league without Russ, while the Rockets show that even Eric Gordon can run that show with similar efficiency. And his \u201cno chance of winning the championship\u201d is the lamest insult of all. I\u2019d love to see Billy spew that dumb chickenshit take to Westbrook\u2019s face.
