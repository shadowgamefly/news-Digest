{"name": "906_4", "child": "", "content": "I like the overall article, but I\u2019m not sure this quote and approach is very Musk-like at all. In fact, Elon Musk specifically talks about NOT \u201creasoning by analogy\u201d, but \u201creasoning from first principles\u201d. So, rather than saying \u201cWhat does this remind me of?\u201d, I believe Elon is more likely to ask himself (when looking at two different concepts / ideas / objects / processes, etc): \u201cWhat underlying principle drives or causes the behavior or property of this thing?\u201d Or he is more likely to decompose the two things under consideration to their fundamental components before doing comparison or contrast. Elon has, in many different contexts, directly stated that reasoning by analogy is not what he does. ", "title": "", "parent": "906", "creatorid": "902069827380", "id": "9b39f5886189"}
