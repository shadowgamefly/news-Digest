Try naming a single action so far by the GOP Congress or Trump that benefits the working class. Now you can add the GOP SCOTUS to that list that has ruled for the rich and corporations non-stop in the last 20 cases like the democracy-corrupting Citizens United that gives unlimited, usually anonymous, campaign funding by and for the rich. Forget campaign finance reform, voter suppression, environmental, consumer, or worker protections. ", "title": "", "parent": "1558", "creatorid": "1172df96f278", "id": "fadd26f688c2"}
