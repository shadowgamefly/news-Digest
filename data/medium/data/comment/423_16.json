{"name": "423_16", "child": "", "content": "Everyone seems to have focused on equity without a thought given to debt (which I\u2019ve seen estimated at north of 4 billion). Depending on how the agreements were written (call provisions), Travis\u2019 position could be shaky if the lenders decide to start making noise. Compounding the problem is Uber\u2019s cash bleed. Even if they could ride out a demand for repayment on the debt on hand, they would still need more coming in. No one in their right mind would extend new credit, much less invest for equity. I suspect that Travis is facing an offer he can\u2019t refuse in the not too distant future: step down and lock in something for the future, or watch it go into bankruptcy and burn worthless shares for fuel while the creditors pick the carcass.
