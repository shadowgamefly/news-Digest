I read a fascinating article called These 8 Metrics Predicted 70% of Satisfaction at Work It suggests, also based on research, that quality of co-workers is the single biggest contributor to employee engagement. This is because it impacts us every single day in a tangible way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent with your article at all. The surveys ask different questions and attempt to measure different things. It\u2019s possible that mastery is a huge factor is career decisions and quality of co-workers influences engagement (once we\u2019re in the role). Totally complementary. I wanted to share that research with you because I thought you\u2019d find it interesting and helpful. I\u2019d love to know what you think. Omer ", "name": "2317_1", "id": "f892d75a6cc2"}
