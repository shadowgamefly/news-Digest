{"name": "1448_1", "child": "", "content": "great article Samantha Mckinney.I have some reservation on the \u201cno devices\u201d point.You see,I work from home often and since I am not physically connected with my team,that makes it literally mandatory for me to be connected with them electronically always.We share screens on Skype,we do video conferencing and we also do long audio conferences,all to ensure that all are on the same page and there is no communication.We also need to check emails regularly so that any urgent issue is addressed immediately. So you see my point,work from home requires more closer electronic communication as we need to compensate for the lack of face to face interaction.Maybe it works if you are an independent consultant but certainly not in situations where you need to manage remote teams and where communication becomes the key to success.
