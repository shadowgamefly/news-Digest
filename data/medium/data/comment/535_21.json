I\u2019m putting a link here to a song \u201cAny Moment\u201d-it\u2019s Cinderella\u2019s prince seducing the baker\u2019s wife, who just had a baby. It\u2019s a funny song, but the guy is such a cad. Lol. Sondheim is pretty much on target for the things some men will say to get what they want. But it\u2019s a running theme throughout the play, and they get called out for it. The whole thing is a challenge to our weak social mores and the devastation they cause us, really. I think you would really like the whole thing. Just don\u2019t watch the movie. the play version (1991) is SO MUCH BETTER.  enjoy.\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "535", "creatorid": "9519d329cb15", "id": "f88f0f24c666"}
