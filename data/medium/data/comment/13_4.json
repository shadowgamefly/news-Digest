{"name": "13_4", "child": "", "content": "I find this really sad. Google Books was (and still is) genuinely ambitious, to an almost comical degree. Digitize humanity\u2019s entire corpus of written literature? That\u2019s amazing! Also, good luck. But there\u2019s something to be said for a commercial giant doing this because it thinks there\u2019s something in it for them. Google is unlikely to stop existing any time soon, whereas nonprofits can and often do have money problems, and Google is highly capable of monetizing that data through machine learning and artificial intelligence in a way that few others are. My favorite thing about Google Books is the romantic nature of it. There are so many books that may never be read by another human being simply due to physical scarcity\u200a\u2014\u200adigitizing them makes niche and unique information widespread and easily discoverable. I\u2019d rather not lose humanities tremendous written body of work, and Google\u2019s as good as any to do it. Though it would be cool if the Library of Congress stepped up it\u2019s game, because, you know, this is the thing they\u2019re supposed to be doing.
