{"name": "605_17", "child": "", "content": "As a long-time Lytro customer, what is most disappointing is that there is no announcement of this on the Lytro Website. Nor is there any information for consumers who have purchased the product in regards to future support, software updates etc. The fact that the announcement was made in a kind of out of the way blog post here 5 days ago rather than as an announcement on the website itself, is quite disappointing. In fact the most recent official Lytro blog post from 5 April (after this blog entry) addresses nothing except the creative benefits of Lightfield tech and espousing the Illum for this purpose. To the consumers like myself who believe Lytro products hold a unique position (and understand that the 1st Gen and Illum Cameras were more than just a tool for refocusing), we purchased them and supported the company and its innovative ideas, yet this method of announcement kind of says we don\u2019t really mean very much. Some courtesy towards Lytro customers in the way of a proper announcement on the website and affording those customers the opportunity to at least know where we stand would be great. The Illum camera itself wasn\u2019t cheap, but I was excited to be an early adopter and liked the additional features that came over time. That said, while I have found it useful for my purposes, it certainly wasn\u2019t money that I wanted to waste and reading this I (like many customers) have no idea where I stand.
