{"content": "I think Simmons once said to help him decide he would swap the teams of the candidates. So imagine Harden on the Thunder and Russ on the Rockets or Kawhi on either of those teams and Harden and Russ on the Spurs. I imagine if Harden and Russ swapped they would be in pretty much the same situation as now. The Thunder would still be in the playoffs but not top 4 in the conference and the Rockets would be third or fourth seed. And if either of them were on the Spurs, the Spurs would still be the same old Spurs. I dont think Kawhi would be able to do the same just because I haven\u2019t seen him go crazy offensively which could be necessary on any given night. While his defense is probably the best in the league he can only stop one or two guys from really scoring and I dont think that would be enough to get wins considering the defensive capabilities of the rest of the Rockets and Thunder team. I have to lean a little towards Harden because I think making your teammates better shows your a better player than someone who tries to do it all himself. And because Harden makes his players better I think if he were on the Thunder, that they would have a better record. They\u2019re bench and role players really aren\u2019t complete garbage like a lot of people say they are. I know it\u2019s a lot of hypothetical and imaginary stuff but it\u2019s fun to think about.
