If not, schools that use the Access Islam program are singling out Islam for special favorable treatment\u200a\u2014\u200aIOW, establishing a religion. The excuse, \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d shows the insidiousness of the very term. The use of the term \u201cIslamophobia\u201d is a way to conflate actual crimes\u200a\u2014\u200atorching a mosque, eg.\u200a\u2014\u200awith simple opinion, that Islam is BS (which it is.) So the cure for this \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d meaning unwelcome opinion, is \u201cunderstanding\u201d\u2026that is, an exposition about the history and doctrines of Islam from an Islamic point of view, to the disadvantage of other religions. Establishment of religion that would not be tolerated for other religious groups, such as setting aside school property for prayer rooms, is now viewed favorably by leftists as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for Muslims. If the government gives a grant to an educational corporation, which then makes a pro-Islam (or pro any other religion) program for schools, that is a complete violation of the Establishment clause.
