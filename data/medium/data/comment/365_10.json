{"name": "365_10", "child": "", "content": "Hi Chad and Joshua, I had a thought. Do you think it would work if writers assigned themselves a specific chapter of a story to write? For example, say Author A writes chapter 1. Then Author B chooses to write chapter 2. After that\u2019s published, Author C signs up for chapter 3. And Author D volunteers for chapter 4 and so on. This seems like a better technique for the \u201cDifferent Author, Different Chapter\u201d purpose of the publication to work.Rather than many writers writing the same chapter out of which only one will be chosen for publishing. I will admit, one flaw with this suggested approach would be the writer needing to be committed enough to deliver their assigned chapter by the deadline. But do you think it\u2019s a viable approach?
