I try to find a pocket in this thing called a heart; so that I can find a flicker of happiness. Just so I can light a small spark and light a fire from deep within and begin to start living again! Thank you for sharing your insights and intellectual writing! \u2014 Tomorrow is there to help us cope. It is not a magical remedy. It is just another name for hope. But if we let it, it does work like magic. LOVE THIS POINT YOU MADE!! Regards, Naomi ", "name": "2190_4", "id": "37a828a9b24d"}
