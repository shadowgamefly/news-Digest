For pretty much all of GUI history, users have been conditioned to know how to use and react to error, success, and warning messages displayed as a modal window on top of what they\u2019re doing. Every program we\u2019ve ever used does it, and it\u2019s a useful and well-accepted way to convey those types of messages. If it makes sense to fit the message into the page itself, that\u2019s certainly a good option. But a modal warning message is a great way to get the user to focus on one message exclusively, if that\u2019s the effect that\u2019s desired.
