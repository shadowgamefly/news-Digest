For example, checking instacart for Whole Foods prices near you, a 2.08 oz jar is $3.69, but the bulk is $5.99 a pound. That\u2019s fully 5 times as expensive. I\u2019d be interested in what the exact same thing would have cost at Whole Foods\u200a\u2014\u200aI bet that the cheese, eggs, chicken and strawberries would be *much* (like, 25%+) more, but the rest a little less, especially bc you would have saved $6.60 just on the sesame seeds and the oats (switching to Bob\u2019s at $4.39). You can cart it all up at Instacart without registering\u200a\u2014\u200aWhole Foods doesn\u2019t (yet) upcharge for their orders (I\u2019ve seen what the store employees have to do\u200a\u2014\u200aI would totally upcharge, even if it\u2019s just a flat $2/order).
