{"content": "White woman here. Thank you for this. Really made me think of my own privilege and how I occupy spaces. I\u2019m not one of those white women that demands more cheese at chipotle, but I AM that person that, among many other things, ties my salary to my self-worth (as much as I know it isn\u2019t, but how I measure my self-worth is a giant can of worms I won\u2019t open right now). I\u2019m a very determined person and I won\u2019t lie, one motivator behind my determination is the belief that I \u201cdeserve\u201d more. I never took a moment to evaluate where that belief comes from. Thank you again, lots to think about.
