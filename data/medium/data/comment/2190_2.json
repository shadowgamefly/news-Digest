We now met not as children, but as grownups for the first time, even in a cyber space at that, and hence we are more emotional compatriots, but not as friends, and certainly not as \u2018pals\u2019. Still, I find your words letting me feel not as less familial, less sweeter and less comfortable than \u2018friends\u2019 of long lost, but now see again whom I\u2019ve known for all my life, ever on ward since my \u2018pal-hood\u2019 as a very young days. Thank you for a chance to read your piece here at the Medium, and that which helped me to recollect some of my precious sweet childhood including pals in it so comfortable to be together with, for we saw things similarly, thought & understood things so very much alike, and was so happy to be together. As often and at any and all of the time of day! I thank you for writing a beautiful piece, here, RN! ", "name": "2190_2", "id": "4aefdaa86ddc"}
