I do know that it is often the poorest nations that bear the brunt and yet do not demonise the immigrants and refugees. Niger for instance neighbouring Nigerian had to deal with the millions who crossed the border fleeing Boko Harem. Is Niger as wealthy as any of the \u2018whining\u2019 so called developed nations? Well done South Africa. Harmonious cohabitation can be achieved. The wages of Nigerian civil servants were docked so that Nigeria could support the anti-apartheid movement not just with rhetoric. I went to school with several South Africans, beneficiaries of Federal Government offers of free schooling and refuge. Biafran refugees found a home in the then Zaire. Stop crossing over to people who hate you just because your skin colour is different. Remember who stands by you and with you in your time of need.
