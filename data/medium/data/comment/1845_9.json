{"name": "1845_9", "child": "", "content": "As a meditation and Qigong instructor I really relate to boosting the brain and relieving stress through those modalities. My question is: if you don\u2019t get a negative comment or someone doesn\u2019t act confrontational with you you haven\u2019t been heard? Hmm, I am not sure about that. I think many \u201clurkers and trolls\u201d do that not because they feel strongly about what you have said, they just want to stir up the S@#!. I get SO tired of no matter what I post on FB (and typically it is very supportive and loving) that SOMEONE has to say something negative. It\u2019s their 15 minutes of fame. The vehicle for them to purge. I say to them \u201cstart meditating\u201d or look into some emotional healing. I do my best to let the good and the less good roll off my back and not put too much credence into it. It\u2019s all opinion. And one day you are the golden child, the next you are forgotten. So just live your life and send it out there, then let it go. We just recently got the Amazon Echo and now we just tell \u201cAlexa\u201d to \u201cput on some soft jazz\u201d and voila it is playing throughout the house creating a really nice environment. Some days it\u2019s new age relaxation and some days its rock! It all depends on our mood. For what it is worth, thanks for a thought-provoking post. Now forget I said it.\u00a0;) ", "title": "", "parent": "1845", "creatorid": "12c1710d9a51", "id": "59e8c79700b9"}
