If the Lakers get to keep their pick this year they can simply wait a year and sign George in free agency. If Indiana doesn\u2019t upgrade their roster around George he is leaving and they have no way to do that. He wants to play in LA and gutting the team isn\u2019t going to make him happy. But, a top 3 pick, maybe Ingram develops, sign George, trade some of the other young guys and all of a sudden that is a quality team. Add one more piece and it becomes a really good team.
