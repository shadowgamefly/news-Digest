They rejoice when they pass Go and collect $200. They despair when they have to pay rent. They are anxious when its their turn to roll the dice, they hope when they land on Chance, they breath a sigh of relief when they land on Free Parking. The \u201cgoal\u201d of meditation is not to help them become more successful at Monopoly. The \u201cgoal\u201d of meditation is not to help them better handle the emotions that arise from playing Monopoy. The \u201cgoal\u201d is not even to persuade them that the game is just an illusion.
