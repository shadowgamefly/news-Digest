{"name": "1352_12", "child": "", "content": "Nice essay. Thanks for writing it!\u00a0:) Don\u2019t you see the problem, though? There isn\u2019t that much profit for these mega-multinational faceless corporations in responsible, sustainable, localized, organic farming. So why would they promote that? Did Monsanto ever make any money that way? Pepsi? (ummm\u2026.I don\u2019t know whether to LOL or \u3160\u3160 about that one\u2026but the idea that Pepsi gives a flying fuck about my health or yours is ludicrous).. While I would argue that there is, in fact, a HUMONGOUS economic opportunity here, just like there is in green energy, electric everything, and most forms of decentralization\u2026that economic result would help the lowly 99%-ers who don\u2019t control everything, don\u2019t have congressman and presidents in their pockets, don\u2019t have billion dollar labs trying to make themselves useful, don\u2019t have the USDA and FDA rubber stamping shit for them, etc. The idea that we create useful, rewarding, wholesome local jobs and economic arrangement is scary to the powers that be\u2026and it will probably be labelled \u201ccommunism\u201d or something, like it often is before Uncle Sam sends the military into places like Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador, and bombs them to kingdom come. It is a threat to the status quo. However it is the only real hope humanity has\u2026returning to pre-20th century style farming, only this time with computers and battery-powered machines and robots to help. These kind of groups you talk about here are best just ignored completely, but I\u2019m glad you are showing them for what they are..irresponsible and greedy people who don\u2019t care about mankind, the Earth, or the future at all.
