{"name": "304_17", "child": "", "content": "The hard reality is that there is no correlation between quantity of successful writing and quality and important of the writing. Basically people want to be entertained not informed. Fantasy trumps reality any day. Emotion trumps insight. The great Dutch philosopher Spinoza is said to have sold a single copy of his masterwork in his own lifetime. Yet his writing went on to turn the world upside down as it was highly instrumental in breaking the church\u2019s suffocating grip on scientific thinking. If you want a huge audience, one simply need study the techniques and formulas that mass audiences naturally snap up, from romantic fluff to tabloid conspiracy theories. Their is big money in junk writing. Even the great Harry Potter series is nothing more than a standard morality play rapped inside an extreme fantasy. Granted J. K. Rowling in is damn good at this popular formula of writing. But, yes, if one really loves writing one writes for one\u2019s own pleasure without concern for the opinions of others.
