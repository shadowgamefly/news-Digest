{"name": "414_13", "child": "", "content": "It\u2019s my understanding that while Google and Facebook both are legally permitted to create policies to sell customer data to the highest bidder, they emphatically don\u2019t. In fact, here\u2019s Facebook making a direct pledge: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t sell any of your information to anyone and we never will.\u201d Google\u2019s information page on how ads work is headlined: \u201cWe do not sell your personal information to anyone.\u201d Pretty clear. Both these companies see their platforms as the end game, where all that data (both internal and stuff they buy from others) is used to target advertising to the most appropriate (and valuable) users. So when GOPs talk of making a level playing field for internet services and carriers, it\u2019s nonsense. Facebook and Google, believing that they need consumer trust, make it an issue that they don\u2019t sell your information. The Comcasts, Verizons, Time-Warners, and AT&T of the world make donations to Congress because they obviously want to do just that. And it worked!
