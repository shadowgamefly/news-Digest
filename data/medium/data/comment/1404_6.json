I know Dave Troy from a Geeks on a Plane trip we did to South America a few years ago (I\u2019m also obsessed with his essential service Mailstrom).

Thank you so much for sharing and if you come across anything like that feel free to tag me on it too! I\u2019m a huge fan of sharing \u201cworks in progress\u201d as a way to refine and develop ideas with a broader community. Looking forward to your insights! ps: I\u2019m a big fan of TEDx, I spoke at TEDxWallstreet about micro-influence, entrepreneurship and the future of protest and TEDxESCP about digital identities. It\u2019s a really great tribe of smart people! ", "title": "", "parent": "1404", "creatorid": "cd7d303d1f95", "id": "a434f5976173"}
