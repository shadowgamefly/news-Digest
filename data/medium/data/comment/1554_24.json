{"name": "1554_24", "child": "", "content": "@Robert Moscardini, actually, ID laws vary by state, and so there are plenty of states where, no, you are not required to have ID and the police might ask, but there is no law you have to comply. Now, as we know, some police like to believe their personal authority is greater than the law, and so I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t cause you problems\u200a\u2014\u200aonly that it may not be a legal requirement. I am as left as you will get. I don\u2019t want anything to impede voting; in fact, I think it should be a legal requirement of citizenship. I think that purging voter rolls for obviously stupid rationales such as names shared with felons\u200a\u2014\u200ain states where a felony strikes voting rights (that\u2019s not in every state)- or other demonstrably bad logic should be outlawed. Just like the no-fly list\u2026if you can\u2019t prove someone is a problem, you have to err on the side of rights. However, even I don\u2019t understand the resistance to voter ID laws. I think you should be able to use a broad range of ID\u200a\u2014\u200astate, DL, passport, official school ID, military, etc\u200a\u2014\u200abut I can think of really no true reason why someone shouldn\u2019t have or be able to reasonably get an ID. Now, if people\u2019s ability to get ID is being barred, that\u2019s another problem to address. But, like someone else said, with all the get out to vote and other campaigns money is poured into, helping people get IDs is seems to be helpful for a number of reasons. Just like you have to get a social security card to work (and no one is complaining about that), or like males have to register for the draft at 18, what would be the issue with requiring everyone at 18 to get some state or federal ID that would be good for 10 years, like a passport? Heck, AZ DLs are good until you\u2019re 65! ", "title": "", "parent": "1554", "creatorid": "2980a45e5468", "id": "fa605aedc9c7"}
