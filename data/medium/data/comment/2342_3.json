Though I think there is a conflict in what you said in here. It\u2019s these phrases: Collect screenshots of how others have solved similar problems. And Trendy words/designs/clothes, etc. are exactly that: trends. Aren\u2019t what the big companies are doing is trend? Like them being the trendsetters. Why is it that you advice to stay clear for trends while it is okay to present how others solved problem? Disclaimer: I am not criticizing the point of the article, rather I am just clarifying the difference of the two. I loved the article. Cheers \ud83d\udc9a ", "name": "2342_3"}
