{"name": "1528_1", "child": "", "content": "An escalation, yes, but perhaps not as large as you assume. In 2013, Assad was reeling. America could have caused his defeat with targeted airstrikes, as in Libya. Alternatively, the United States could have convinced Russia that propping up Assad would be too costly. Establishing a no-fly zone before Russia intervened could have done that. Providing rebels with shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles might have as well. Now, to be clear, I\u2019m not saying any of these were obviously good ideas. For example, rebels would have shot down Syrian aircraft with shoulder-mounted SAMs, but some would surely end up in the hands of anti-American forces, who would now be shooting down U.S. aircraft over Iraq or Syria. In 2015, Russia knew that intervening with air power carried little risk. If they expected to lose planes and suffer casualties, and thought the chances of ensuring Assad\u2019s survival were lower, the Russians might have stayed out.
