I wrote something a few weeks back about suffering that seems to be speak to a similar thing. \u201cAt BC, I took a Buddhism class and it taught me that \u201csuffering is the thing that connects us all.\u201d I understood it in theory, but hardly in practice. My life was one unmarred by loss, betrayel, accusation, difficulty. Now, having been through much more, I see that suffering is a form of a gift. What if there was no suffering? Why does God even \u201callow\u201d for suffering? Today on run, it occurred to me that if suffering didn\u2019t exist, we\u2019d all be running around living more easily but with a much shallower, less connected existence. At least in my life, this would be true. This isn\u2019t to say anyone who hasn\u2019t experienced loss can\u2019t be deep or connected, it\u2019s merely saying that the experience of loss is an access point for greater depth (where depth isn\u2019t bad thing) and increased connection. I believe that when we share suffering, it lightens the load and binds us more deeply to others. When the bible says \u2018blessed be the poor\u2019 I think it can also be read as \u2018blessed be the suffering.\u2019 Without suffering, you might lose a distant acquaintance reaching out from halfway around the world to say \u2018I understand and I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 a business idea focused on helping others through the aftermath, and the ability to connect deeply and comfort genuinely with others when they need it. At least I would have.\u201d ", "name": "2212_14", "id": "da745929c91"}
