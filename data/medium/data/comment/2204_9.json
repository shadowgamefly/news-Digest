I think so many of us naturally fall into this category as we tread through what is seemingly unfamiliar territory. With a neverending ocean of information on just about any and every subject, we can end up with information overload while on our quest to research and find the best practices in any arena. I think we do this to avoid reinventing the wheel. A trend that I fall into is: think up a good idea, google it to see if anyone else has already coined it (if no, hurry up and create a\u00a0.com or\u00a0.org, and if yes, pout until the next great idea comes along). The problem with this is that I end up scatterbrained trying to be a jack-of-all trades and end up stuck with no end in sight. Who wants to be a novice that lives in a world of theories and ideas forever? This is surely a call to action, not an attempt to discount the importance of acquiring a well-rounded education. Countless times I have been guilty of seeking out the best practices of others just to get an idea of how to proceed on something, yet never actually have anything to show for it. Point taken. \u201cStop postponing. Start taking action.\u201d Great piece. ", "name": "2204_9", "id": "fdfa64977be2"}
