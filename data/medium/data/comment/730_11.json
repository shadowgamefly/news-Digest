People who love their work + feel financial secure (FIRST!) will naturally look for charity work for free but let them grow in whatever way they want. I\u2019m not designer, I\u2019m not making any fake designs, but i\u2019m partially in the field as a Front-end developer and I love designer fake redesigns and I know that this is a good way to show off your ideas, creativity and a perfect way to gain popularity when you have 0 clients. It pissess you off because it\u2019s a TRICK that actually works. If you are better then stop wasting your time on writing articles with your super vision how the world should look and work for charity. Whatever.
