You\u2019ve written it in such a way that any web developer should be able to understand it. I do think you should have included the JSX version of your code at the end, as that native syntax for creating element by element is very off-putting. I also think a link at the end to an article on uni-directional data flow would help reinforce (with deeper understanding) the points you have articulated so well. Again, great job at writing an unassuming entry-level article. ", "name": "2400_15"}
