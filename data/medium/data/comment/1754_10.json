It\u2019s like a morning shot of inspiration for those of us aspiring to write more. 3 months back, I made a promise to write more. Everyday, if possible. A tag-along decision was also to try and publish an article a week. This is what has happened so far. I have made significant progress in writing almost daily. Even though they are without a particular agenda and often times are personal observations about life around me. But I just can\u2019t seem to get around to publishing the articles. I am plagued with this worry\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwhy bother the world with this gibberish\u201d. And when I do publish something, the fact that very few see it cements the self-doubts that drag me down. Any word of advise on how to keep going?
