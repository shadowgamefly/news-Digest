{"name": "1016_13", "child": "", "content": "To our team, wireframes are just a means to an end, which in our case is full-fidelity prototype. We don\u2019t skip the step of wireframing, but depending on the complexity of the project, level of interaction, we spend enough time in the wireframes to make sure we have enough detail before we move to full-fidelity quickly. As we move downstream in the process, it becomes more and more expensive to make changes, so we try to discover potholes as early in the process as we can, and for better or worse, wireframes still have a role in that. As you mentioned, we never use wireframes as a \u201cSource of Truth\u201d, to us, the final prototype, after usability testing becomes source of truth with associated documentation. Unfortunately, not everyone is equipped to develop a full-fidelity prototypes and I don\u2019t find Invision to do the trick for me; if I really want to do a good usability test, I need to develop multiple paths and see how users go about completing their task. If you are testing globally (We had to test in US/UK, Netherlands and China), I haven\u2019t found off-the-shelf tool that can easily do it.
