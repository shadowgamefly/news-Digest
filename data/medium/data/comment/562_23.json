I spent the afternoon sorting a three-inch pile of essays written by my aunt, about her life, what she thought about death, what it was like to live through the death of her father from tuberculosis, and the death of two husbands, and then an essay by her daughter about her mother\u2019s last hours, the moment when she said, I\u2019m ready. Now, to find your essay. Time just opened up and gave me a front row seat on the no-time ahead. Thanks for this lovely tribute.
