{"name": "598_1", "child": "", "content": "Intersting review of a equally interesting product\u00a0. Few points i would like to make #1\u00a0. I am not sure if the analogy you made with desktop browser in the start holds right beyond interface layer\u00a0. Browser is just a wrapper/container. There is more to the problem of service -silo than just lack shared wrapper\u00a0. Problem solved by browser is of stadardising rendering /delivery of content and making it easily consumable\u00a0. Issue of context switching is far from solved IMHO. #2 On Wand being an Uber App: The term uber is abused like anything\u00a0. META app is a better description of what Wand is trying to do IMHO #3 On there choice of first use case of Wi Fi sharing to demonstrate the potential of technology\u00a0. I feel that this is the best use case they could have choosen to introduce their service. Thanks to sharing /on demand companies like AirBnB/Uber/ doorDash these service based micro transaction are on rise\u00a0. When I rent a couch on AirBnB host need to give me these details manualy and revoke it later. A big enough pain point for host\u00a0. This can drive much needed traction in early adopters. Funamentally the client apps on phone which use cloud in any significant way are nothing but a delivery front end for cloud based services\u00a0. WAND is making that experiecnce unified by offering a meta wrapper and \u201capp streaming\u201d capabilities\u00a0.this put them in a unique position. I am looking forward to see how WAND evolve in future\u00a0. ", "title": "", "parent": "598", "creatorid": "f37280b478fe", "id": "54336f5380e4"}
