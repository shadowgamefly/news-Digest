{"name": "1551_2", "child": "", "content": "NASA announced today the discovery of an \u201cIntelligence Black hole\u201d. This last fall, NASA sent a survey probe to Washington D.C.. The primary mission for this probe (code name SWAMP) was to search for intelligent life. While initial reports showed definite signs of intelligence, the probe started sending back garbled transmissions on January 20th. Nasa scientists at first assumed there was a malfunction with the probe, but analysis showed that the probe was working perfectly and the gibberish that was being sent back was actually emissions from an \u201cIntelligence Black Hole\u201d. Scientists have long speculated that such a black hole was theoretically possible. This type of black hole occurs when a very dense object is placed in a position of high authority. All intelligence surrounding this object is sucked into it, twisted, crushed and then spit back out as the opposite of intelligence or alternative intelligence. Scientists warn that as more intelligence is sucked into the black hole, the larger and more dangerous it becomes. As of this time, they are unsure of the ultimate outcome. The best case scenario is that it will implode and simply disappear into a point of nothingness and the worst case scenario is that it will convert all of reality into a world where facts and intelligence are meaningless.
