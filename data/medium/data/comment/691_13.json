When you visualize work or even visualize a board of who is on what team people can get uncomfortable and feel threatened. I remember when we made a board which exposed systemic issues way above the team level. Management got upset because they didn\u2019t want to solve for those at the time, and really preferred that we focused elsewhere. It was so frustrating because if we would have solved for those systemic issues at the time, maybe we could have provided better value more continuously to our customers. I think what we missed was having the alignment with management about what we were doing there in the first place. Maybe our board initiative would have persisted if we would have started with that? I don\u2019t know. So what I\u2019m saying is that I think the concept of alignment plays a part here. ", "title": "", "parent": "691", "creatorid": "317014acd998", "id": "727f5f4df95"}
