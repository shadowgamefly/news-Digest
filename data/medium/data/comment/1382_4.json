It might suggest it, but you can\u2019t claim that the developer is worthless, because of a certain bug or even crash. You can tell a lot about software without viewing the source code Could you know if the software will harm your PC? Will it corrupt data? Are the developers in collusion with foreign nationalities, aimed at destroying your livelihood (forgive the hyperbole). I do agree that you can look at a software and make a snap judgment about it, without going through every procedure or understanding its code base beforehand. Just keep in mind that most of what you\u2019d actually learn is that the software is either good or bad. This topic was a smearing campaign, using a very broad brush to paint an opponent badly. Fun to those who believe as you do, but don\u2019t really convey any point in particular. You can tell enough about a person to draw a conclusion about an obvious mental problem This reminds me of the narrative that Hillary Clinton has a severe mental disorder, due to some weird behavior. I found it tacky and offensive on a logical level, and found the people making it be devoided of any morals. This was a detailed analysis and this is a specific diagnosis that is agreed upon because there IS ample evidence. Not enough. Most are circumstantial. Especially when most of Trump appearances are meant to be a show. How would you distinguish between the two? Anyone is free to refute this appraisal which goes through each point with evidence but you have to refute them. Someone more knowledgeable about psychology could go through the diagnosis and make corrections, where applicable. I won\u2019t try and refute anything based on some quick internet searches.
