{"name": "308_6", "child": "", "content": "Have read Fight Club but to be honest, the movie gave out the message better. But anyway, crazy book.One criminally underrated book and one that truly changed the way I think, is Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts.

I cannot praise this book enough.", "title": "", "parent": "308", "creatorid": "173bee27ddf2", "id": "d297e084bec3"}
