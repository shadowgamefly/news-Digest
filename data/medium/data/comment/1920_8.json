And I will battle anyone who tries to stop me on this issue-the award should absolutely, positively not be the \u201cmost valuable player\u201d award. It should be the far simpler, more to the point \u201cmost outstanding player\u201d award. The problem with the \u201cvaluable\u201d part is that it turns it into a combination individual/team award that nobody seems to have a solid grasp on how to measure. Change it to what they do in soccer, for any of the big yearly best player awards in Europe or globally\u200a\u2014\u200abest player wins, simple as that. Making team quality a main part of the equation brings in too much subjective, theoretical stuff that isn\u2019t nearly important as we make it out to be.
