{"name": "730_24", "child": "", "content": "Interesting article, I agree on the content, but not on the form. The mistake comes when you take these redesigns as business proposals, I think they should be viewed as visual exercises. As a designer there are few (and sometimes none) opportunities to experiment and bring innovative solutions to projects from the point of view of design. I believe that if these designs were taken into due consideration, it would be possible to educate users, including people who think like you, in a visual training that avoids the visual attacks that are seen in our sector. Of course everyone knows that facebook has ads, but modifying an image module for an ad is not critical. We should scrape a little beyond the surface and value the work as what it is, and not as a business objective to monetize and monitor a social network. However unwarranted color changes, as in the skype branding, if that could be more critical if they are not accompanied by a design argument. P.S. Thank you very much for your articles, you always learn something new and sorry for my horrible English! ", "title": "", "parent": "730", "creatorid": "bd13688c10fd", "id": "c220dfd6db87"}
