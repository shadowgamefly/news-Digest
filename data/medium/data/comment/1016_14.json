For the last two projects I worked closely with a ux designer mainly on a whiteboard. Each participant had their own marker and we just drew all day and took pictures of it, put it on trello in our own product structure, then started making small component designs in the process. Which we could test on interaction with small prototypes.. I noticed we saved time and it was just really fun to work like this!
