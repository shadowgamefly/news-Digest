{"name": "1105_6", "child": "", "content": "Indeed it should be taught at school. Excerpt: Quran (4:74) \u2013 \u201eLet those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.\u201c The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, who were led meekly to the slaughter. These Muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah. This is the theological basis for today\u2019s suicide bombers. And there is more violence on top of that coming from Quran. We should be educated. Islam, if it really is the religion of peace, needs reformation and pacification. The problem are not the Muslims, for I have experienced are as good as the next Christian. It is the scripture that needs better than literal interpretation.
