{"name": "594_7", "child": "", "content": "No one should underestimate what Apple did. But I do wish Apple would stop their pretense that they performed magic with the introduction of the iPhone (or the Mac before it, come to that). What Apple does better than anyone is best thought of as \u201cTechnical Marketing\u201d: they sell what they have very, very well, so people think \u201cWow!\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s amazing\u201d\u2026. but they (quietly) let people confuse their marketing talents with their technical ones. Case in point: as it happens, I read the coverage of the iPhone announcement on my smartphone using a proper browser (with a track pad and keyboard: it was a Nokia E61). What it lacked (compared with the iPhone) was a touch screen, but those were not rare at the time. So the capabilities of the iPhone were not new (although most people hadn\u2019t experienced them), but the implementation was extremely good and the \u201ccourage of their convictions\u201d drove the concept into the general public\u2019s consciousness. Don\u2019t get me wrong: the iPhone was an amazing development, but what was/is great about the thing is not that it is full of Apple\u2019s inventions, but that it pulls a lot of existing inventions (largely made by other people) together into a single thing, *and then* convinces people that what they have is a great (when it\u2019s good) or tolerable (when it isn\u2019t or if you\u2019re holding it wrong).
