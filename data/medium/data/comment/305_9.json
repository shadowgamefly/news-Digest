Out of all the article\u2019s in Medium Daily Digest, I scrolled through the stories, (Not looking at the author\u2019s) and choose, \u201cHow Successful People Make A Ding in the Universe\u201d I LOVE the story you told. You incorporated high level Dinger\u2019s successes, mixing history with evolved thinking and foresight. As I continue to rebuild my life from the ashes of a National Disaster that took all but my breath, I am encouraged, strengthened, and inspired to wipe off the ashes, try again and no matter what \u201cNEVER GIVE UP\u201d After I hit the like/share button, I realized that my FAVORITE AURTHOR, \u201cBENJAMIN P. HARDY\" recommended you! He is a HERO of mine, and has been a POWERFUL POSITIVE influence in my life for the past 18 months since the Butte Fire took away everything including my identity. His writing\u2019s continue to help me move past the OVERWHELMING ADVERSITIES and into the HIGHER AWARENESS OF MY LIFE\u2019S PURPOSE. Your writing keeps me GROUNDED in WHO I AM, FOCUSED in WHERE I\u2019M GOING, and GRATITUDE for your ability to compose such a compelling article that moves the MIND, BODY and SPIRIT.
