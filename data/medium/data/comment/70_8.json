{"id": "d92f0d34f686", "content": "Great write up, Tristan. You basically nailed the stage we\u2019re at with Tettra as a team of six people. I agree that teams shouldn\u2019t spend a lot of time or resources setting up robust analytics infrastructure in the beginning, but I do think it\u2019s important to develop a culture of analytical thinking from the start. We\u2019re working on that at Tettra by investing in setting up analytics, tracking metrics on regular cadences and using data to make informed decisions as much as we can. It\u2019s hard, but we think it\u2019ll be the key to scaling decision making later on. Do you have any suggestions for teams on how they can develop a data culture from the start?
