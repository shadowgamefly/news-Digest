Great product design touches so many different aspects of a business. Customer support/AM\u2019s speak to users every day and can provide front-line feedback. Sales can help design teams better understand the demands of the market. Engineers are great at communicating what is able to be accomplished, and how it impacts the user experience. As a designer, I love being at a place where the whole company is engaged and committed to achieving our goals through thoughtful design. Thanks for this! Great post (per usual).
