{"content": "For a biography that I am writing I relied on obscure books (from the 1870s-1880s) that showed up in targeted searches. They provided relevant information, insight and further references. I do not have access to a university library, but thanks to Google Books, I was able to plow ahead from my home computer. I wish Google would continue to digitize books and make the full text searchable and readable. Maybe the authors\u2019 interests could be protected some other way\u200a\u2014\u200aby disabling the copying of text or by requiring a payment to enable text copying. I also wish Google would digitize world newspapers and non-English books. ", "child": "", "parent": "23", "title": "", "creatorid": "e7b0f8728a80", "name": "23_12", "id": "f4cafc0c6507"}
