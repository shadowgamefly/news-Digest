I don\u2019t know a one single case where somebody changed the way he/she thinks through online discussion. Slight adjustments might happened, but more or less our views are set pretty much in stone. Going after him through another channel is definitely bad idea, you were really looking for trouble, so advice from Medium seems reasonable to me. If you don\u2019t like something, ignore, and move on. Chances that you will change somebody\u2019s mind are less than 0.00001% With these kind of cases, ignorance is your strongest weapon.
