{"name": "211_5", "child": "", "content": "I would agree whole-heartedly with you, sir. I am myself a lifelong and passionate Bradbury fan, having read all of his books multiple times. This may be in part because autumn is, as we all know, the best time of year, and Bradbury is, as we all know, the best author to read at this time of year. \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes\u201d and \u201cThe October Country,\u201d along with \u201cThe Halloween Tree\u201d are, as we all know, the best works to read aloud to immerse yourself psychicly in the season. If, additionally, you listen to Ahmad Jamal\u2019s rendering of \u201cAutumn in New York\u201d while reading these texts aloud, there is a chance of overdosing on the season, which isn\u2019t recommended for first-timers. Best to build a tolerance before going for the extreme. ", "title": "", "parent": "211", "creatorid": "48742c96971a", "id": "d5db607b96ea"}
