{"name": "905_1", "child": "", "content": "Give me a break! There are enough adults out there with the attitude of 5- year-olds already. Your five-year-old doesn\u2019t have to worry about stuff because mommy & daddy give it to him unasked. The-five-year is not aware of the interdependence of life and the need to be a giver rather than a taker. And in case you didn\u2019t notice at age 5, boys and girls are different. Girls are much more concerned with (because they are better tuned into) the emotions of others. Boys are fascinated with machines and noises. Girls tend to be more self-aware, and quick to acknowledge pain; boys tend to be caught up in something else (that bike ride) and overlook pain. Though I personally detest it, there is a book out (with accompanying poster) All I Ever Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten. It is true that we must unlearn certain things (things we invented for ourselves or picked up from our peers- like smoking), but these are not the things we were taught. You must have had an idilic 6th year because the qualities you associate with it - \u2026with limitless imagination and the optimism that those visions will come true. \u2026as honestly as you possibly can, with yourself and everyone else. \u2026without caring for even a single second about what other people think. \u2026being your own biggest fan and believer in yourself. \u2026disregardful of failure, regardless how many times it happens. -I see in few 5-year-olds. Perhaps you mistake optimism with unrealistic expectations, honesty with lack of self-reflection, not caring about what other people think with not caring about other people, being a beliver in oneself with being egocentric, and disregard of failure with the failure to learn from experience. Now you know what I mean when I say that there are enough adults out there with the attitude of 5- year-olds already.
