{"name": "349_2", "child": "", "content": "My maternal grandfather passed away when I was little. He has been such an important person in my life: he taught me my very first words (ironically enough, it wasn\u2019t my father or mother), he cared for me, played with me when my parents were busy with my younger siblings, and he always encouraged me and lifted me up\u2014he never, ever abandoned me or scolded me. In short, I think you could say he was my entire childhood. But he had an extremely egregious habit\u2014smoking. He would smoke every day, anytime, anywhere, even though we tried to talk him out of it. That, and the fact that he was already old\u2014he was over 70 at the time\u2014added up to a terrible stroke as he was crossing the street to get to our house. He collapsed and never stood again. The only thing we found in his pocket was a bag of black candy, flavored with Northern Vietnam\u00a0herbs\u2014my\u00a0favorite. So when I read this post, it got straight to my heart from the headline and I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from spilling down my cheeks\u00a0however\u00a0hard\u00a0I\u00a0tried. I can relate to the pain and the sadness you\u2019ve had to experience, and I sincerely express my sympathy. However, meanwhile, you\u2019ve inspired me to spread the word about the most unforgettable\u00a0person\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0life. Thank you so much, Dan. May you always love and be loved.
