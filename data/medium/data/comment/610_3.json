She started it herself on the floor of her studio in LA, 18 months later the company (she) net\u2026..thats-NET 1.5 million! The media buyers she trained where 80% women. At a company meeting the complaint was that they were being told what to do and not being asked nicely. This was a fast moving infomercial media company that thousands were lost if the deal wasn't sealed in an hour. I had to explain it was like a sports team. We have to hustle to make the score- and if we have to ask if you would please take the ball and put in the basket was just not how it was going to get done. Please don\u2019t take it as a lack of respect. Think of it as a sports game!!! To top it off the receptionist name was Mimi Seaman. I felt like I was in the outer limits\u2026..to be clear I'm not making a sexist statement the owner could eat anyones lunch she was a woman and tough and did 80% of the billing.
