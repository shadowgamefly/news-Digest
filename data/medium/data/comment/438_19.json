There are so many possibilities for the future, so many things that will surely change technologically, socially, and culturally. My thoughts: \u201cIn the (my future) future, racism will be seen as a curable disease. Humans will have morphed into several new species. We will have colonized the solar system. Depending on the gravitational well or lagrangian point we are raised in, and type of AI we connect to.We will consider ourselves one family, and find our ideas of family, and marriage and it\u2019s legal binding as primitive as we find arranged marriage today. Children will be everyone's responsibility in some way, and so the definition of the family will change to mean all of us. We will find death and burial abhorrent, as we may be able to extend our 1st bodies to 300 years or more and upload to new physical or virtual forms when these have expired. We will see religion and beliefs in gods as primitive and abhorrent, we may even look upon individuals who insist on such beliefs, as mentally ill or mentally weak. Since we will have super long lives, we will began exploring our galaxy and may find staying in one place to long disgusting. To seek out new lives and new civilizations will be more than a cultural mantra but a personal one that may include bonding and crossbreeding with aliens of every type, we may find keeping ones genes as is, as narcissistic, and abhorrent. Enhancement and diversity of our DNA strands may become one of our top priorities. (Who knows we may engage in abductions and cattle mutilations on some far away solar systems\u2026LOL) ", "title": "", "parent": "438", "creatorid": "35125112c9a", "id": "1fb140970245"}
