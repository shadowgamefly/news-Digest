{"name": "1880_10", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for everything Leo! Buffer, Joel and Yourself have been startup role models to me for a long time. Many decisions I make can in some part be tied back to a Buffer article or knowledge you and/or Joel shared. Thanks for helping make the world transparent. Your role at Buffer will certainly be missed at times and big ups to you for respecting Joel\u2019s ambitions. He will certainly do well in his role. Best of luck to you, Sunil and your new venture. I\u2019ll still be following along with your journey. Please continue to write and share as much knowledge as possible. Following the blogging advice Buffer shared over the years would be good to follow now\u00a0\u263a All the best and thanks to you and Joel for daily being my founder inspiration. I hope to one day credit some of a successful venture to your inspiration. ", "title": "", "parent": "1880", "creatorid": "7287bca4f1ad", "id": "bf4a77a7e901"}
