{"name": "1771_1", "child": "", "content": "If we want to develop a healthy democracy, we need a diverse and highly connected social fabric. This requires creating contexts in which the American public voluntarily struggles with the challenges of diversity to build bonds that will last a lifetime. If anyone ever asks you what is meant by the term \u201cboilerplate\u201d, see the above selection as an example. The way it usually works, is you take a string of touchy-feely cliches (healthy democracy, diverse and highly connected social fabric, voluntarily struggles, challenges of diversity, build bonds), and syntacticate them into what looks like readable text. The fact that someone apparently real smart has bothered to do that, then goes on to obscure the plain reality that not one of the cliches particularly says anything, and that daisy-chained all together like this, they say even less. A first-class exercise in long-form propaganda: the objective is never to communicate anything nor to suggest genuine courses of plausible action, it is rather to assure by hypnotic and manipulative means, that somebody real smart is already on it.
