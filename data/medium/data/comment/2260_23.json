They can be found for much more reasonable prices somewhere that sells bulk dry goods that you scoop out of bins. I\u2019ve had success at spice shops and \u201cethnic\u201d grocers in the past. Unless you or someone you\u2019re serving has celiac disease. Oats aren\u2019t *supposed* to produce gluten, but they can pick up DNA from non-oat crops on nearby fields and become contaminated. As of a few years ago, McCann\u2019s was known to have a safe crop, so that would be worth the markup (or research). You\u2019ll be able to get your sesame seeds, and any other spices you use in relatively high quantity, for a much more reasonable price while you\u2019re there. The spice aisle of a grocery is really not the most economic place to buy spices. ", "name": "2260_23", "id": "b6b974a62535"}
