{"name": "1567_4", "child": "", "content": "False analogy. Gorsuch was so universally accepted as a good candidate that he was voted in on a voice vote a decade ago. Gorsuch isn\u2019t out of the main stream. These Senators aren\u2019t opposing him based on representing their states. They are doing so to appease their donors and their most vocal supporters. They have to be seen as opposing Trump at every turn. So no they aren\u2019t representing 53% of the population. They are representing a tiny minority. Which is how they have gotten themselves into this mess in the first place. The larger party is so unpopular that it lost to Donald Trump who might be the worst candidate in the history of human politics. Republicans currently hold 33 governor seats. If those Senators would truly represented those 53% of citizens that would change. They just have to realize that the silent majority is more important as are those that aren\u2019t writing them the big checks.
