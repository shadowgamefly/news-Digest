I do not sleep.I am a thousand winds that blow.I am the diamond glints on snow.I am the sunlight on ripened grain.I am the gentle autumn rain.When you awaken in the morning\u2019s hushI am the swift uplifting rushOf quiet birds in circled flight.I am the soft stars that shine at night.Do not stand at my grave and cry;I am not there. I did not die. ~~Mary Elizabeth Frye My grandmother has been dead for almost 25 years. I still want to call her, to talk to her, to go (back) once more to her house. Sometimes I cry when I think of her because I miss her so, I want her to meet my \u201cThe One\u201d, whom she would love if only because I do. I want to grow up to be like her. I\u2019m trying to do that. You\u2019ve got this: cry when you need to cry, wear Gery\u2019s shirt for as long as you want to, even forever. He will always be just a thought away. Peace and blessings. ", "title": "", "parent": "1143", "creatorid": "d3d6ddfb69fd", "id": "2a6bad75c18e"}
