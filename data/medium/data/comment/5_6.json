I\u2019ve met a (very) few nice mainland Chinese when travelling, I\u2019ve also experienced the extremely loud, extremely rude, line cutting, completely and utterly inconsiderate tour group participants (sometimes to the extent that I need to walk in front of my wife and physically shoulder check them so that they don\u2019t know her off the path onto the ground). When you hear the tour guide asking them in Mandarin to please allow others to pass and the 90% of the group ignoring them, you have to start to wonder if it\u2019s not simply that 90% of the tour group simply don\u2019t care about others at all.
