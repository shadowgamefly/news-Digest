{"name": "1496_1", "child": "", "content": "Hi Dylan, Just wanted to thank you for putting your insults to me in a bulleted format. Many people curse me out in run-on sentences, so their words not only sting but they\u2019re also hard to read. In a bulleted list like yours, they are much easier for me to scan later on if I am starting to feel good about myself and want to be reminded that I am nothing more than a typical leftist whining fool. So thanks again, Dylan, and if you want to rant at me again in the future, please continue with the bulleted style. Maybe you could even suggest to the other trolls who stop by my posts to adopt the bulleted format? I can\u2019t speak for other writers on Medium, but I know that for me it is a relief to both my eyes and tired mind at the end of a day. Well, that\u2019s all I have time for now, Dylan, need to get back to my micro aggressions. Carry on, my friend! \u2013AI ", "title": "", "parent": "1496", "creatorid": "a95f5352e2fc", "id": "3bacf29161c4"}
