{"name": "349_19", "child": "", "content": "My grandfather told this story about how he inadvertently became General Patton\u2019s scotch supplier during the war. He and a friend commandeered a mortuary affairs truck and filled it to the brim with Johnny Walker Red. One evening, close to the end of the war, they\u2019re in Germany hanging out at a makeshift Officer\u2019s Club getting a little sloppy. A voice behind him suddenly booms, \u201cHey boys, where can a fella get some of that Johnny Walker\u00a0Red!?\u201d My grandfather doesn\u2019t even look, but just mutters, \u201cwell that depends on who you are.\u201d Suddenly everyone at the table stands and salutes, while he turns around to find himself staring at the waist of a man carrying an ivory handled Colt revolver. Grandad was quick-witted though, so he bargained with Patton for tennis rackets and balls for his men to get some R&R when they weren\u2019t fighting. All that to say, Dan, reading this story was like sitting in his den hearing that story again. It made me feel close to him, even though it was your grandad. Like your grandfather he started slipping towards the end of his life with early onset Alzheimer's. But this piece made me smile at his memory, and miss him. Thanks for sharing such a beautiful memory with all of us. ", "title": "", "parent": "349", "creatorid": "25cd1cc62d2c", "id": "96b57fa0e78"}
