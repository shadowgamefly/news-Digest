Instead develop a good mindfulness practice and learn to face down your fear so that you diminish it directly, not in situ but leaving it lurking elsewhere for you to trip over another day. Thich NhatHanhs book on fer is one of the best but also Pema Chodron \u2018Places that Scare You\u2019, or you can read some of my posts on how I over came fear myself, but the two books are really good and helped me achieve that goal. good luck you have a great heart ", "name": "2200_4", "id": "5b81d33c41fe"}
