A story for Christmas that was a little long for here, but mostly 100 word stories and a few slightly longer ones lately. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how you do in terms of getting eyes on your work and receiving feedback. A very precious few are able to find my stories because visibility is hard to control\u00a0here, and the number of followers you have has little to do with how many reccomends you\u2019ll get. Then, of course, not everyone will be feeling a story just because I had the desire to write it. Of those few who reccomend, sometimes none of them will feel comfortable giving feedback. I\u2019ve been very frustrated here at times, but I\u2019ve made some friends on Medium that I think the world of. They make the difference for me, so I\u2019ve kept going and tried to keep my expectations\u00a0low. It feels so good to get the pleasant surprise of readers every once in a while, but for me it\u2019s very hit or miss. I hope you get all you want out of your experiment. Best of luck!
