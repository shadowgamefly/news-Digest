{"name": "727_2", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for collecting your thoughts here, Jessie! Lyft, with its redesign, looks a lot now like Uber, and I don\u2019t mean that in a negative light. Features like time and route to pick up, fare estimates, driver and car details are ever so important in this space. For urbanites, I still wonder as a product guy: what if users are able to alter their pickup location once they see the route to pick up? If I know that the corner of 34th and 9th is jammed, and the cops seem to be diverting traffic a certain way, wouldn\u2019t it be great if I can let my driver know to pick me up at the corner of 35th and 8th instead? And\u00a0\u2026 wouldn\u2019t a feature like this be acting on user feedback in close to realtime?\u00a0:) I can\u2019t wait to see what Lyft or Uber can develop in this space. Even better if they can propose a better pick up location based on traffic data from one of the maps providers. ", "title": "", "parent": "727", "creatorid": "982b182d6f21", "id": "f194a7ecdadd"}
