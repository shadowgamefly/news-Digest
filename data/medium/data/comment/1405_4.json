{"name": "1405_4", "child": "", "content": "I think it somewhat depends on how many other people a particular follower is following, what people you each follow together and also which people they follow have the most number of like followers. To flip that around and put it into the perspective of your own inbox and the people you follow, when you receive suggestions, emails and any sort of list from Medium showing you some suggested pieces to read there isn\u2019t enough room to list all of the writing from all of the people you are following. So an algorithm is used to determine what to show you and try to give you what you will be most likely to be intrigued by. If several people you are following recommend the same piece then it\u2019s likely you\u2019d be interested in the same thing. Then writers who are more popular and who publish more often go to the front of the line. Even though you have a certain number of followers, it\u2019s not guaranteed that they will receive any notification of your stories or see them listed prominently in their feed. They might have so much content to dig through that it\u2019s buried. Even if they do see the fact that you wrote a story, they still might not choose to read it. It\u2019s not necessarily that they aren\u2019t interested, it could be that out of the choices they are offered they are more interested in other stories and they have a finite amount of time and/or ability to read. The views are of people actually coming to the page on Medium and the reads are of people spending the amount of time on the page which is estimated to read the full story.
