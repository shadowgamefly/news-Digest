{"name": "1534_13", "child": "", "content": "Just think, if Aaron Rupar, or any of the other Progressive shills at ThinkProgress, had devoted this much time, effort, and gleeful zeal writing articles about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email and server and what potential ties there were between her, the Clinton Global Iniative, John Podesta and Russia, she just might be serving time in a federal penitentiary by now. In fact, a good case of surveillance against her, the CGI, John Podesta, Donna Brazile, and many, many others can be made with the FISA Court, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should immediately request those warrants and start that investigation. Seeing as ThinkProgress and the Progressive Left in general have been running interference for Obama, Rice and Farkas, it should be easy pickings. The current Justice Department can use all of the tactics employed by the former administration and collect scads of information about private citizen Clinton and the named others and then unmask those names and conversations willy-nilly to the media, without any consequence of wrongdoing, just like members of the former administration did. Of course, we\u2019ll have to do it using taxpayer dollars, whereas ThinkProgress and the other Leftist media outlets get to do it using funding from George Soros and other global leftist billionaires.
