The diagnosis here\u200a\u2014\u200athat bad-actors are co-opting the language of the left and of free speech defenders while making online spaces toxic\u200a\u2014\u200ais spot-on. So is the sentiment that we want to encourage marginalized peoples\u2019 voices and provide for their safety. However, we can call for limits to hate speech and harassment without bashing the values of freedom and openness. That\u2019s why this article\u2019s call for \u2018pragmatism\u2019 is so shallow, if not outright dangerous. If we\u2019re going to stand for inclusivity, we should be advocating for openness and transparency, not deriding those values and handing over the regulatory reigns to technocrats. Now, free speech and progressive ideas have always co-existed uneasily. Have they? This statement is some lazy historicizing. It misses how key free speech cases like NYT v Sullivan enabled civil rights leaders to speak truth to power. It\u2019s woefully U.S.-centric, not taking into account a global context where free speech is the driving force for dissent. I found this article\u2019s leitmotif that suggests a free internet is somehow at odds with progressive ideas to be really concerning. Silicon Valley may have co-opted the rhetoric into their corporate logic, but the idea to empower people with the ability to speak is certainly progressive. Well, that\u2019s all well and good, but Reddit is not a government. It is a corporation. In the US, the right to free speech applies only when the government attempts to limit what people say\u00a0\u2026 Content moderation by private technology companies is not a First Amendment violation; in most cases, it\u2019s just a matter of enforcing pre-existing Terms of Service.\u201d On any given day, more than a billion people access Facebook. Activists and protesters use Facebook to assemble and people around the world create affinity groups. Facebook has become a public space, so much so that many people only know the internet as Facebook. Given these circumstances, isn\u2019t it a little dismissive to 1) think of free speech rights in a U.S. context only and 2) treat free speech concerns as a matter only relevant to government intrusion? What gives you the confidence that the social media technocrats know how to handle harassment and hate speech? Similar to how government, with its \u201cseries of tubes\u201d mindset has been shown to be a poor regulator of the internet, these websites handle matters of public importance poorly. Facebook was \u201cjust enforcing Terms of Service\u201d when it blocked historic Vietnam images and when it supported pro-Kremlin trolls in suspending Ukrainian users for their political views. And do I really need to bring up Instagram\u2019s censorship of nudity? Unfortunately, the public doesn\u2019t know how ToS are applied. Ditto for Twitter and Reddit. The early internet idealism you suggest people move away from is the same guiding force that would advocate for transparency in how content is moderated so the people can work towards holding these websites accountable. I don\u2019t see Twitter et al coming solely from a hacker lineage, especially given that hackers dislike proprietary access to information and the centralization/corporatization of the internet. Much like white supremacists have co-opted the language of the left, libertarian entrepreneurs have co-opted early internet idealism to suit their own goals. We agree that internet companies need to be doing more to deal with online hate speech and harassment. Tech communities need to be doing more to proactively intervene and address sexism and racism. But we should hold on to open and free values when calling for change. Regulating speech isn\u2019t giving in, it\u2019s changing the rhetoric. Because in not addressing harassment, these websites are ultimately ignoring the free speech rights of thousands of people who\u2019d otherwise join the conversation.
