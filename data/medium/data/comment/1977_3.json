As you said this is a blog and you are free to express yourself in any way you chose. Correct I am rolling with you. It\u2019s when people become so uptight and self righteous that makes me sick. All of a sudden they can\u2019t stand to hear certain words. Well excuse me. That\u2019s not what I really wanted to say. So here it is well excuse the fuck out of me. I missed the memo when you became holier than thou. Now to end this I agree with you. If you look around a lot a writers and motivational speakers are toning down their language so people will buy their messages. Hmm if I\u2019m attempting to help you let me think. What\u2019s more direct get off of your butt or hey get your ass in gear? You be the judge of that. Yeah younger audiences I would chose softer words but for an adult crowd please let the a\u2019s and f\u2019s fall where they need to. Now here is the difference this new word that is floating around the motivational scene is epic. (Hmm) it just doesn\u2019t hit home for me. I have heard Lisa Nichols throw it out and James Ray used it over the last year. As I said hmm it sounds weak. Now Tony Robbins we all know let\u2019s it fall where and when it needs to fall. One of his closing lines is be fucking amazing. I get that. Step up and step out of the crowd and deliver the goods. Nothing about being epic. What the fuck does that mean? It does nothing for me.
