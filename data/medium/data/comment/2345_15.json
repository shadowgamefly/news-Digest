Feeling closer to God every time I\u2019m forced to realize the devil has a minion running the USA. Actually he has another pseudo christian in charge, yes Mr-only-eat-with-your-wife-sense! The devil sure has many disguises! Quite sobering the reality that we can all go at any moment. Geeze, I have to get better so at least I can swim when the fires come. When fire an brimstone rains down I wanna meet my maker as fast as possible! Okay folks time to give my bike some exercise, as North Korea or some other crazy ass place will be getting ready their nukes. Redemption can come at a cost! Hope you believe\u00a0:-) ", "name": "2345_15"}
