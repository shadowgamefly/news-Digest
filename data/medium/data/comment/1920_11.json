(LeBron is still the best player in the league, but he takes more game off than anyone else and his team isn\u2019t even the #1 seed in the East, so he\u2019s not a candidate this year). I vote for Harden because the Rockets are way better than anyone expected, and he is the reason why. Westbrook is having one of the all time great single seasons, but the Thunder are who we thought they would be without KD. [Neither the Cavs nor the Spurs have exceeded expectations.] At some point, the relationship between the player\u2019s performance and the team\u2019s performance should count. OTOH, I love watching Westbrook go all J. Robert Oppenheimer on the League, while Harden\u2019s fall-into-the-defender-and-flop routine is a weak look and should be outlawed.
