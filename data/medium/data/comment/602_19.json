{"name": "602_19", "child": "", "content": "I fucking hate it when people write these click bait headlines. You write this as if this book was the root cause of you becoming a billionaire. Give me a break. It is like saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to join these two pieces of wire together. Suddenly I saw a soldering manual and I was able to do it and now I\u2019m a billionaire.\u201d Or, titling your piece, \u201chow a kindergarten ABC book made me a billionaire\u201d because you learned how to read from that book and now you\u2019re a billionaire. No, you\u2019re a billionaire because you\u2019re a fucking genius and you had a team of geniuses to work with you. And you got lucky that people believed in you. You had ideas, you made something by using ALL your knowledge, it worked, and then you got investors that helped you achieve your dream. I wouldn\u2019t become a billionaire even if I read that same book a hundred times. And there are bunch of other geniuses who are not where you are because people did not believe in them enough. Congratulations on making a shitload of money. ", "title": "", "parent": "602", "creatorid": "7eead9661e4e", "id": "d6d16b5c2554"}
