{"name": "712_14", "child": "", "content": "Luigi, Thanks for taking the time to respond! You bring up many points, and I definitely agree! Of course when I began I definitely referred to these guidelines as rules, and unfortunately, that\u2019s where I messed up as a designer. This post is definitely written as more of a cautionary tale of a designer who did not understand that. And this carries over to palettes, which I\u2019ve seen as a very iffy thing with many posts on dribbble. One big thing which many designers do is use Material as a rulebook and strictly follow it as opposed to using it as a metaphor and a guideline, and I\u2019m sorry if I did not convey that through this! I also agree that there\u2019s no need to copy-cat Google! I didn\u2019t mean to say people should, instead I meant to imply that many do, and that it\u2019s an issue! Once again, Thanks for taking the time to read and respond! -Nikhil! ", "title": "", "parent": "712", "creatorid": "8f5fd528c600", "id": "49e738bbfe77"}
