{"name": "861_7", "child": "", "content": "I\u2018m an American working at a Fortune 500, managing a team of 6 people, who\u2019s lived in The Netherlands for almost 10 years now. This sounds about right tbh- the Dutch are fiercely protective of both their personal time, and their work organisation time(if you have X hours for a task, that\u2019s how long you work on it, then if you don\u2019t finish, you tell your manager and it becomes their problem to fix, because obviously you didn\u2019t allot enough hours for it.) There are upsides and downsides to it, as in so many things in life. But I definitely find the work/life balance and work life quality to be far superior here than in the States. It also doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest that the assistants were that blunt- the Dutch are renowned for it- it occasionally causes issues in my very multicultural workplace.
