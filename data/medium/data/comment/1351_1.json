Personally, I was at the Women\u2019s March, and if it was me I\u2019d encourage the woman to post the pictures. But, it\u2019s not hard to see where it could be questionable as a business decision and I could see someone wanting to pull their money out. Also, it doesn\u2019t have to do specifically with this article, but I kind of wish they interviewed some white dudes to see if something similar ever happened to them? I mean, L.L. Bean got in big trouble because one member of a large board was a Trump supporter. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the case, but it doesn\u2019t seem implausible that these people would make similar demands on a white guy if he used the company as a platform for an overtly political statement.
