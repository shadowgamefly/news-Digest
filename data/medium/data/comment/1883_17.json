{"name": "1883_17", "child": "", "content": "Why does so much of the discourse in America revolve around ethnic groups? Do you guys realize how many different \u201cshades\u201d of \u201cwhite people\u201d there are? This is not a homogeneous group of people you\u2019re talking about here. Racism exists, of that I have no doubt. I have personally been on the receiving end a couple of times. That said, this isn\u2019t a fight between \u201cwhite vs black\u201d because frankly what is going on is a lot more gray than what I\u2019ve reading here. The color of the person\u2019s skin is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to racism. \u201cWhite people\u201d are racist against other \u201cwhite people\u201d every single day and not enough is being said about the racism expressed by \u201cblack people\u201d against people of differing ethnic groups. So to recap: please break the stereotype of this being a white vs black thing. It\u2019s much bigger than that. Often you are being discriminated against due to internal office politics and (as other commentators have mentioned) the same happens to \u201cwhite people\u201d on a daily basis.
