{"id": "fa87b2bc8f77", "content": "Being a New Yorker\u2026 I have to agree with your essay! I grew up in NYC all my life but after I got older I noticed that life here is hard! Unless you are well to do you can make a life in NY but if you are like the 98 percent of us you will be living check by check. Even the outer boroughs have become expensive to live in! Imagine paying close to 1700 rent for a shitty apartment in a shitty ghetto! It basically became time for me to pick up my family and move to a place where I can live in peace and tranquility. I went South to Va! Don\u2019t get me wrong I still have a love for New York like many who have left the Empire State. It\u2019s just financially I want to have some more money in my pocket and raise a family in relative calm and ease. Kudos to you for deciding to move and take back your life. It takes a lot of time to make that decision to leave but in the end I\u2019m sure you are happier for it! Great essay Sean!
