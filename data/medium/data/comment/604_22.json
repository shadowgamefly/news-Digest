He was probably a talented CEO, with a larger contribution to the overall project than his co-founders (he alludes to this with his description of there work ethic) and should\u2019ve been deserving of 5 million dollars out of 10 million combined (especially at such an early stage). Something along the lines of Mark & his co-founders, where he took 25%, and the others got 10 or less. His co-founders are probably going to have a nice life too, being millionaires working at Twitter. I don\u2019t feel bad for them at all. Enjoy the 5 million bucks Antonio.
