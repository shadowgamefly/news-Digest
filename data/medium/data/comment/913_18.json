Of course, no such implication was ever made by the poster. This is just data. Maybe we should all cool it with the projecting our own interpretations as blame onto the surveyors and instead be grateful data like this exists at all. You can\u2019t expect data that\u2019s completely unbiased without a sample size of 100%. And you\u2019re never gonna see that survey, so all you\u2019re really arguing here is that we just stop doing surveys altogether.
