{"name": "412_7", "child": "", "content": "Great article Abhishek\u00a0! In this battle of Swiggy vs Zomato hinging greatly on delivery\u00a0, customer and post sales experience the ultimate winner I feel will be the business which will bring in more new customers. For a restaurant aggregation makes sense only if new customers come to his/her shop till the time the same old customers order from any of these platform it just cuts the share from restaurant\u2019s revenue as a commission.Zomato has a huge database of customer experience which when sliced and diced can really push them to bring on new customers. But since logistics is not owned by them the the control over customer experience becomes little challenging and they have to run a very tight ship to achieve great delivery experience.Swiggy on other hand has a advantage with last mile control and keeping food delivery as their prime objective. But getting new customers by just a great delivery experience won\u2019t be sufficient. You need to invest in marketing and MLT to ensure your platform bring in new conversions. In short aggregation business which have to scale need to have some asset investment or sales/asset ratio must be low otherwise they will be just cutting from restaurants top line always. With Zomato\u2019s new cloud kitchen might be a sound way to invest in an asset and scale business. My bet is on them.
