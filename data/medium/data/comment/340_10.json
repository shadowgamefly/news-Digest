They want more realistic and useful skills to be shared with student\u2019s in their chosen career. They too have the same rhetoric around the the system of education being broken. We need more adaptive learning styles to sustain our future. The social and psychological needs of the younger generation are not being met by education. Certainly too, they are not meeting the dynamic needs of business\u200a\u2014\u200aso why keep doing things in the same way? Will be interested to see how this one progresses. On a separate note, the line for me in the article is \u201cit\u2019s rare that I feel so inspired by one entrepreneur and his or her vision\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI am looking at subjects areas to study and I\u2019m constantly intrigued by how truly \u2018entrepreneurial\u2019 people actually are\u200a\u2014\u200athe word is used a lot and I wonder has the definition changed over recent years, how do we view it and does it actually have meaning any more? Any views? ", "title": "", "parent": "340", "creatorid": "c7beebb1fcb8", "id": "d7e8719006c9"}
