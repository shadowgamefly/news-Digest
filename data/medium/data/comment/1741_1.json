{"name": "1741_1", "child": "", "content": "So true. Just this morning I made a conscious decision to not look at my phone until I got to the office (except to see if one of my children had called or texted me). Instead, I spent time with our puppy (not really optional), made a list of goals for myself for the day and began reading a book that has been on my to-do list for weeks. It is so important to disconnect and know/love our alone time. Not that long ago, my son received a school assignment to spend a 24-hour period technology-free. It was just the two of us, but we spent that 24-hour period together and it was one of the best, most connected days I have ever had with my son. Thanks for the reminder of our core need for balance.
