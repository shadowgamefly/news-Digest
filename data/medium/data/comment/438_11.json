{"name": "438_11", "child": "", "content": "Really good points here! Even though things seem crazy right now, I have faith that things will get better. We are just a blip in time. Reality is brutal and awful at times, but I believe the goodness within us can prevail. Tech has gotten a bad rap these days for various reasons, but I look at these as growing pains. Part of why I have faith in tech, and why I choose to make it my profession is because I believe in a better tomorrow, and I know that the goodness in humanity can prevail. I grew up on sci-fi, with an obsession for the future, only to find myself so confused about how this world works as the Internet has made me aware of so many atrocities. But this is what growing up is. I will never stop working towards a better world, in whatever way I can. ", "title": "", "parent": "438", "creatorid": "ed9b48038dd9", "id": "37ddf02960e8"}
