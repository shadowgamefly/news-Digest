{"name": "1346_1", "child": "", "content": "I once described Medium to a colleague as the offspring of WordPress and Twitter. But it is and it isn\u2019t. It has the things that we love(d) about WordPress and few of the ones we don\u2019t (especially the stuff that makes WordPress feel too much like, well, Word). From Twitter, you get the sense that Medium spurs a whole new type of writing. That the Medium really does shape the message (no, I\u2019m not the first to bastardise McLuhan today). Some people really do love screaming into the void, but so much of the powerful writing on Medium is more like sobbing, even if it\u2019s sometimes written in ALL CAPS. The best pieces make you sob with them (1, 2). I\u2019ve found stuff that helped me whip up thinking, re-evaluate, write better, laugh in despair. It\u2019s less yelling in a crowd than talking in a bar. Sure, it\u2019s noisy, but there are always interesting conversations and it feels like we\u2019re all friends, even if it\u2019s just the stupor of alcohol talking. Congratulations to the team, I can\u2019t wait to see what renovations you make. ", "title": "", "parent": "1346", "creatorid": "9c34ff4714a0", "id": "881e3cd0018b"}
