Let\u2019s clean it up a bit: When ANYONE IN POWER defends free speech above all other values, they play directly into the hands of ANY AND ALL GROUPS WHOSE SPEECH MAKES OTHERS UNCOMFORTABLE. Regrettably, the same law that enabled the civil rights movement enables white supremacists. It is indeed ironic and to an extent distasteful, but the fact of the matter is that the only speech that needs protection from the law is speech that the majority doesn\u2019t want to hear. Put another way, those that wish to compliment you don\u2019t need any legal protections to do so. It\u2019s the people that insult you that require it. So, to extend another quote from above, it\u2019s not that \u201c for both liberals and libertarians, the solution to bad speech is more speech\u201d; it\u2019s for anyone who understands the principle of free speech, the solution to bad speech is more speech. Regrettably, not everyone understands the principle. BTW, sites such as Talking Points Memo have expressly pointed out that the alt-right movement and the white supremacist movement are two entirely different things, and to conflate the two acts to normalize racism. Don\u2019t do that. The alt-righters are not racists. ", "title": "", "parent": "1767", "creatorid": "66cf5ca0f75f", "id": "ae3274885baa"}
