{"content": "It always makes me happy to see you writing about the Bulls which is more than I can say for the front office there. The fans of the Bulls (myself included) have proven their loyalty to the team through bad times (the sellout crowds during the post Jordan era as the easiest example) and I like to think are some of the more patient and understanding fans considering how the owner refuses to spend money on this team so he can hoard all the cash for the White Sox. So for the life of me I can\u2019t wrap my head around anything that Chicago has done over these last two years when they were given an absolutely golden opportunity to reload this team with talent over the last two off seasons and have simply failed at an epic level. It\u2019s been obvious for a while that GarPax were subpar but their inability to see the forest amongst the trees makes Bulls fans depressed in these cold winters as most other front offices have figured out at least a path to sustained success while our team flounders along like the sad kid with a messed up leg trying to run the mile in gym class.
