{"name": "1187_1", "child": "", "content": "Absolutely agree that a polite no is better than ignoring or worse, making people run in circles. However, my personal experience is that sometimes the best opportunities don\u2019t come nicely packaged with a red ribbon on them. Sometimes a \u201cmaybe\u201d and a willingness to try can lead to doors that may otherwise never be discovered. In hindsight do you think the GPs that didn\u2019t meet you might have missed an opportunity? If life connects you back with some of the people you had approached earlier, who would you value more today\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who said a polite no, or the person who took a chance and gave ten minutes of her time even if it didn\u2019t lead to anything? I believe Silicon Valley works because more people take the meeting than say no. Yes, it is absolutely true that some requests are so unqualified that you know outright it is not worth the time, however I would say that every one of those GPs that didn\u2019t meet you regardless of how they responded was at the losing end in the longer term. They should have looked at your background and known that you deserved one meeting. ", "title": "", "parent": "1187", "creatorid": "8bd707e138cd", "id": "4c526766152a"}
