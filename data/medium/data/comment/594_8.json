{"name": "594_8", "child": "", "content": "Mr. Schiller\u2019s dismissive statements around ubiquitous voice concern me. The appeal of an Echo is that it\u2019s becoming a part of the family experience. That it\u2019s NOT just mine. Also, the Echo is not about replacing screens or being stuck to the kitchen. It\u2019s about ubiquity. And of course we\u2019ll always need and want screens. It\u2019s similar to how textbooks have text and images: a picture says more than thousand words; but still our textbooks use both, aren\u2019t just all images. There\u2019s pros and cons for both, depending on the situation. Even if Apple fixes the broken \u201cHey Siri\u201d, an iPhone in my pocket won\u2019t be able to speak back to me if it stays there, and devices constantly in my ear (AirPods, as fascinating as they are) can\u2019t be the answer at home. I just hope Apple has ideas for fixing assistant computing at home. Today, Apple offers nothing. Amazon has pulled something off that was profoundly Apple: take existing technology (speakers, microphones, speech recognition, a voice assistant) and create something better out of it, impressing the world with ingenious simplicity and usefulness. I\u2019m waiting for the next time Apple will be Apple again. ", "title": "", "parent": "594", "creatorid": "5f1ef9a7564c", "id": "12a409bbb9ac"}
