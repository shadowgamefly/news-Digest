{"content": "I had to stop reading after the title. When corporations can openly beat their customers and deny them service, why would they even bother trying to be nice? Did you read the words on the backs of the officers that removed the passenger? They read POLICE. I\u2019ll grant you the evil corporation called the police, which is within their rights, but the State is responsible for the harm caused during the removal, but your click bait title chooses to ignore that. Obviously the benevolent State can\u2019t be to blame here, its the evil corporation that uses the power of the State we all need to vilify. I don\u2019t support United\u2019s decision to de-board for crew, I don\u2019t support their decision to call the cops, but suggesting that THEY committed an act of violence is disingenuous and pathetic. Then calling is \u201cclass warfare\u201d? My god. You\u2019re just pressing all the right buttons for a response and I fell right into the trap. This isn\u2019t journalism sir, its click bait garbage. ", "child": "", "parent": "20", "title": "", "creatorid": "477f02d8912b", "name": "20_14", "id": "bc0d3129f201"}
