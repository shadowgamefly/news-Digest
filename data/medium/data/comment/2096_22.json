It does not endue awe in the reader but pity. I have lost a family member to a gun and I am NOT in favor of gun control, why? Because I do not wish to lose more family or friends. How may would be alive today if they had been able to defend themselves against someone who did not abide by the current laws forbidding their actions much less additional laws that would make their acts of terror even easier. Would you honestly feel safer knowing that the only guns out there were in the hands of criminals? If so I have a challenge for you. for $1000 I will bet that I can write 1000 words faster than you can. Here are the rules though\u2026 I get to use my computer and I can reuse as many words as I would like. You on the other hand must use an unsharpened pencil, 1 square of toilet tissue, you must wear a blindfold, and your hands will be tied behind your back. Deal? I didn't think so. You wont bet $1000 on a guaranteed lose but your are oh so willing to wager innocent life on gun control\u2026 which has been proven to have worse odds than the wager I just made you.
