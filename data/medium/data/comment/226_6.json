{"name": "226_6", "child": "", "content": "I would like to give you an honest review, and I hope you don\u2019t mind it (sorry if you do). The story is pretty ordinary, two people meet on internet, start talking, then meet in real life. Everybody knows how its going to go, but they still are hooked to it. But the way you have weaved it in words is amazing. I am not so impressed by the story, but more by your writing style. It flows. The minute details like the rustling of the wind and the arrival of the cab drenching the characters in yellow light, simply brilliant.
