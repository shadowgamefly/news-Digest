Whenever somebody says to me \u201cnobody cares about me.\u201d,I ask them one simple question \u201chow much are you caring for others.\u201d.It is very easy to expect others to care about you,your feelings and your failures,but it is very difficult to replicate back the same feeling.Here in Medium,we have a channel which allows us to express our thoughts and also get appropriate responses.But then not everything can be online.A lot many times,physical actual sharing need to be done and replicated. So Caring is a \u201cgive-and-take\u201d policy.People replicate care with care,hate with hate and disinterest with disinterest.This is the unfortunate life truth.
