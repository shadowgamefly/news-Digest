I had my \u201cfamily\u201d gym (everyone in my family is on the plan and my parents paid for it!) which is close to my home and the gym I became a gym- goer in/love. I have the gym that\u2019s included in my grad school tuition which is nice but neither close to home nor school so while its \u201cfree\u201d, I was rarely able to go consistently because it was such a time suck in my already full- load. Then I joined a gym that\u2019s positioned exactly in front of the train station that I use to get home from school and now have NO excuse not to go\u200a\u2014 it\u2019s convenient located. Even if the money doesn\u2019t make sense, my health and sanity are worth it. ", "title": "", "parent": "994", "creatorid": "64df8361759", "id": "d3fc7b4693d9"}
