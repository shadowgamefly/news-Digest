If Democrats could not support Gorsuch, the most highly qualified nominee we have seen in over 10 years, they would not have supported any name Trump would have offered. So it was either change the rules and support Gorsuch, or leave the Supreme court seat vacant for 8 years (assuming Trump wins re-election). There was no way Republicans could let the Democrats get away with leaving the seat vacant for many years so they had no other choice but to put down the crybaby Democrats.
