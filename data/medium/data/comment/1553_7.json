{"name": "1553_7", "child": "", "content": "These people who think in-person voter fraud is some widespread problem have clearly never paid much attention to the process. Registering to vote is basically like making an appointment. You prove your eligibility when you register and then provide your address. You are assigned a polling place based on that address. You either show up for your appointment or you don\u2019t. The notion that someone else will show up for your voting appointment is about as absurd as claiming people are going around to restaurants hoping to steal someone else\u2019s reservation while simultaneously praying that person doesn\u2019t show. Actually it\u2019s much more absurd because there is no guaranteed direct benefit from voting, unlike with that sweet, sweet stolen dinner reservation.
