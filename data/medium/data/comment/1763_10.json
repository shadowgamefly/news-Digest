The problem I\u2019m addressing is that when you block someone who\u2019s commented on your article, NO ONE gets to see their comment anymore. This would be like the writer of an article in some publication getting to \u201cmute\u201d comments they don\u2019t happen to like, so that no one could see that comment unless they had a direct link to its individual URL. If you\u2019re a writer, you should be prepared for criticism, and as long as it\u2019s not abusive, you shouldn\u2019t have the option to prevent anyone other than yourself from seeing it.
