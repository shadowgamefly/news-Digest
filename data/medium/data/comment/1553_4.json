{"name": "1553_4", "child": "", "content": "what a racist GOP ass trying so damn hard to make things difficult for people to vote. they also promised to make things easier for minority to obtain \u201cvalid\u201d ID card like; free. But, they rarely help them, told them to do it on their own when their DMV is incredibly far like in (not sure which state) AL, they cut down many DMV in the poor cities and area, but rarely on the rich area. How the hell can poor people be able to get the valid ID card? I remember my time was easier of getting my ID in Boston, I thought I have everything and DMV told me I need something else. I have to go back and start over again. The waiting period took over 5 hours accumulative. But I have all the time i needed, no hurry, no children, no jobs. Just school that have no class hours on that day. How the hell do you think these poor family or busy family, or single mother have time to do these things? GOP is against family values, and a frakking joke. Looks like conservative only care about their own ass, and if something happen to them, they will blame government. LMAO.
