I\u2019m fairly lucky myself in that I still talk to both of mine but they\u2019re still just as flawed as you or I. I hope you find nice people in your life that can make it happy. There will always be some nice people in the world. They can\u2019t fill all of the gaps but I hope you can work through some of the thoughts that you\u2019re feeling. Feel free to get in touch if you ever fancy a chat. ", "title": "", "parent": "862", "creatorid": "25813f69e8dc", "id": "1340204b4036"}
