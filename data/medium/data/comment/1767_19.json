{"name": "1767_19", "child": "", "content": "To quote a subReddit, Explain it to me like I\u2019m five. How is any media website different than a TV channel, newspaper or magazine? If I don\u2019t like what\u2019s on TV, I change the channel or turn it off. There are thousands of newspapers and magazines that I don\u2019t buy. Why should anyone feel compelled to surf to a site that they complain is junk, then take it seriously? We knew 20 years ago that most of what was on the Web wasn\u2019t real, what\u2019s changed? Most of the Internet traffic these days is porn, Netflix and Amazon. And we complain that what\u2019s left should be safe for everyone. What is safe? Who is everyone? I\u2019ve been \u201conline\u201d since the 80\u2019s. I still believe in Open Source and \u201cthe hacker ethic\u201d. The Internet, specifically the World Wide Web, grew because of people who wanted to see it grow more than they wanted to make millions of dollars. If it weren\u2019t for those unselfish hackers in the beginning, the Web would be owned by just a handful of media conglomerates, like most other media industries. In my half-century on this planet I\u2019ve learned the obvious: If you don\u2019t like a media source, don\u2019t watch it. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s on Twitter, don\u2019t use it. I don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want to listen to \u201cScared Whiteys\u201d (alt-right) crap, don\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple. Just walk away\u2026 Social media is just that, media. They are private enterprises looking to make money by trying to scare, I\u2019m sorry, entertain us. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t buy into it. Now, I know the retort, \u201cwell, you can\u2019t just go live under a rock and not be social.\u201d Really? So you\u2019d rather let the bullies get to you just so you can hang out with the \u201cin\u201d crowd.. that\u2019s sad. And what\u2019s worse is that when the current \u201cin\u201d group feels threatened, they want the government to fix it. Too many think the media make-believe is real. I remember when The Onion was only on paper. It wasn\u2019t non-fiction then and it isn\u2019t now. Too many can\u2019t see that. And now there are those that blame other \u201cfake news\u201d sites for being so believable. Are they really that believable? Or has our society become that gullible? Don\u2019t shoot the messenger, just ignore him. Trolls will do anything for attention, don\u2019t give them any. It was a good thing Leslie Jones left Twitter, it\u2019s too bad she came back. The trolls won. When enough people leave a platform, the trolls will too. And the same goes for any journalism site that gets their news from a social network site; screw them. Do real work and you\u2019ll get my attention. It will be easy to tell when any media source has gone too far, they go out of business because people left. Twitter is still as popular as it is because people like using it, in spite of the whining. When all of the current social media addicts grow up and realize that their life doesn\u2019t really depend on the whole world seeing what they had for breakfast, and how they felt about it, they won\u2019t give any audience to the loud-mouth idiots either. Tired of \u201csharing\u201d online and getting bullied for it. Then don\u2019t. Share with real people you feel comfortable with. It\u2019s better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt. Don\u2019t want you feelings hurt? Don\u2019t surf, surf smarter, or don\u2019t let it get to you. No one can emotionally hurt you without your permission. Want a safe space to just hang out with people you like to be with? Find one, and stay away from the places you don\u2019t feel safe in. Just like real life. Follow your instincts. When you get sick of trying to fix the world (Web), you\u2019ll find your safe space. Or better yet, create it. Just like in real life. I\u2019ll take six friends in real life over six thousand on Facebook any day.
