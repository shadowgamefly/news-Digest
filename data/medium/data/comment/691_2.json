{"name": "691_2", "child": "", "content": "I applaud Joshua Kerievsky and his work with Anzeneering, and regard safety as useful, beneficial and even necessary. But I don\u2019t see safety at the only prerequisite for effective continuous improvement and change. I concur that the absence of visualisation in many organisations is a signifier. I choose to see it as a sign that an organisation, collectively, is in a place where internal dialogues (between people and between groups) might benefit from some improvement. Absent being able to discuss key issues openly and productively, visualisations often only serve to make folks awkwards aware of those limitiations. I see this as one (of many) arguments in favout of Organisational Psychotherapy\u200a\u2014\u200ahelping organisations become better able to talk and think together.
