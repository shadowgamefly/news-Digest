{"id": "99f42c950784", "content": "Try reading Mein Kampf some time. There\u2019s an entire chapter dedicated to a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d about British propaganda. The only \u201cproblem\u201d is that Hitler is spot on w/r/t the lies the Brits (and to a lesser extent, the Americans) told about Belgium. But the following chapters of Mein Kampf assume an equally large conspiracy by Jewish people, which isn\u2019t true. But you can see where the weight of the first assertion (the British gov\u2019t were actively using bullshit propaganda to demonize Germany) carried its legitimacy to the second assertion (Jews secretly control the world). As soon as governments begin to lie and distort the truth, conspiracy theories will bloom like mushrooms after the rain.
