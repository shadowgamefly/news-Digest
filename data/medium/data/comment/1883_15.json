I worked for a staffing agency two years ago where, surprise surprise, I was the ONLY Black Man (also Gay) in the department. In hindsight I realize that was by design because\u2026 ) The department was all women, white women (with the exception of the executive director).) There were no other gay men there (besides the executive director). Naturally, I was the best fit since I covered all of the bases. My Co-Workers were these wretched godawful harpies from the festering bowls of a miserable Hell. I hated every single one of them and the ones that I did like left due to the fact that the environment was so hostile. I honestly don\u2019t need to reiterate the entire experience as you perfectly surmised everything that I had gone through in one posting. Needless to say I quite after my one year anniversary and I changed careers. In my current office it is predominantly black and I\u2019ll never be another token for anyone ever again. More power to you if you are, and I hope they hire that ONE black co-worker to keep you company. ", "title": "", "parent": "1883", "creatorid": "f07bbb5093d1", "id": "da2c5b9994db"}
