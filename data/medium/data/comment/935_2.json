It seems that the government would come in and transfer all of the liquid assets to a new institution, leaving the remaining trading partners to try and retrieve their capital by liquidating the harder assets like unsecured debt, etc... In the short term this would probably freeze credit markets as capital is destroyed, but would it have long term implications like a depression?
