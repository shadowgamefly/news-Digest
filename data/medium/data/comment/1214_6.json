It is that long ago\u00a0since I could say something like that\u00a0about my own heart. If ever. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t it still be\u00a0so? This makes me wonder if I have ever loved and been loved back like that? One possibility is that I might have been\u00a0, but that even love has its expiry date and that is what happened\u00a0to\u00a0mine. The other possibilty is, love like that never\u00a0expires. In that case I obviously never had the luck. In that case, who knows? I might even get lucky once before I die. Everybody should get a taste\u200a\u2014\u200aotherwise, the purpose of living remains a mystery to me. ", "title": "", "parent": "1214", "creatorid": "9d956a9b2b57", "id": "a93b6f19dfc5"}
