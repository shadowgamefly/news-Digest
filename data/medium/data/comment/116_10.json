But I would argue the statement about the visual ETL design tools hit their end of life cycle. Most of them actually emit real code or metadata in form of a DSL. This code is produced faster and more accurately with far less setup or hassles which appears to be immediately self-documenting. The multitude of frameworks like the Linux distors drive the ability to choose one to nuts, yet many of the frameworks are of poor shrewdness for picking their base languages as say Ruby or Python. Even the so-vast Apache ecosystem is a dark forest impossible to navigate in without a projector. Cheers! ", "creatorid": "a25596a8b595", "title": "", "parent": "116", "child": "", "name": "116_10"}
