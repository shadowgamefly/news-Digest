As far as your situation, like you mentioned I am in no way a design life coach, so don\u2019t take my suggestions as the only way to handle your circumstance. From what you mentioned in your comment, it seems like you passion is interior design. I firmly believe that being able to have a career in something you are passionate about isn\u2019t something most people are lucky enough to experience. It also sounds like you have a great opportunity with your internship right now, with that being said, one of the great parts of being in the design industry is that there are ample amounts of freelance or side projects out there. Therefore, I guess what I am saying is that maybe you don\u2019t have to chose. If I was in your shoes, I may try to continue to pursue both (at least for the time being) to see which one I truly did enjoy more and could see myself doing for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not too common to have two great opportunities from which to chose (Interior and Web Design). So try to embrace it and if time allows right now, I would try to explore both opportunities as much as I could to see which one really spoke to me the most. I hope that helps. Good luck ", "name": "2342_11"}
