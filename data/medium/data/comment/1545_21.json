Provide some evidence to support the disinformation that, \u201cdespite court rulings and studies finding that requiring photo ID at the polls is discriminatory and reduced minority turnout.\u201d Please, give us one example of why someone who was voting legally wouldn\u2019t have an valid ID! As far as I can tell, only people who are already doing something illegal don\u2019t have an ID. Should I whine and complain because I have to show ID before getting on a plane? Isn\u2019t that also discriminatory? Is it discriminatory for a cop to ask me for my DL when I get pulled over? Why do banks demand ID for me to cash a check? This sounds like a bunch of liberal BS designed to make it easier for people to break the laws of our country. Not surprisingly, the majority of these people would vote for the party most likely to \u201cgive them stuff!\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1545", "creatorid": "3620e9f5c0c8", "id": "7d4a1d2c4eda"}
