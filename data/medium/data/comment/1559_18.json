While requiring ID at the voting booth probably inconveniences people who don\u2019t have driver licenses, these laws started becoming a thing 20 years ago. The Democrats have had plenty of time to get their voters to the DMV and the voter registration centers. It\u2019s not like Voter ID is a surprise. As for the Voting Rights Act case: The formula for deciding which counties had to get federal approval for voting law changes was set in 1966. Congress has been reauthorizing the law every few years, with no changes to the formula. Result: Shelby County, which brought the case, has a black majority on its county commission, yet is still treated by the VRA like a segregationist stronghold. The Congress could simply update the formula and get the VRA back on track, but the Dems seem more interested in demagoguing the issue.
