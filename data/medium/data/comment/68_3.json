I was gonna show how this incident wasn\u2019t that big of a deal; I was gonna compare this team to other teams who have had players who beat up fans (2 of the 3 major offenders played for us), or teams who employed players that assaulted coaches (he also played for us) or other teammates (we almost won CHAMPIONSHIPS with a few of them). I was gonna use examples of players who brought guns to the locker room, and went on media-fueled tirades against \u201cpractice\u201d. I was gonna wrap up my whole argument by explaining how the NY media market blows incidents like this, and boat cruises on the weekend, and butt-fumbles, and firework problems, and NFL-themed tattoo\u2019s, into full scale indictments on the credibility of my teams and my city. Then, I remembered Stephon Marbury pulled this same shit 13 years ago. We are so fcuking screwed. ", "title": "", "parent": "68", "creatorid": "e23a3595d61", "id": "e070cece7a35"}
