I can see that you already know that is true. Still your style, willingness to open your head like a lid and let everyone see what\u2019s in there is a bravery I don\u2019t see often. I found myself laughing with you and your reactions to your own thoughts. I felt like I was reading something that could have been my own. I also had plans\u2026 I was there with you. I pretended that I was your best friend and we went there together to \u2018deal\u2019 and \u2018heal.\u2019 Because I\u2019ve done similar things\u200a\u2014\u200arun off on my own when I need to center up. The year after my niece died, I decided to get in my car the day after her birthday and drive almost 20 hours with no break to sleep, go to the beach and fly a kite in her honor. She would have been one years old. It\u2019s amazing the clarity and rate of our thoughts when we go off to be alone. Far from the interference of people who know us, the interactions we can have with strangers are all too often a blessing and a curse. I loved this piece. I don\u2019t know where you are in your healing process, but one thing is for sure, you keep that sense of humor and rich inner world and you will be just fine. The pain will make you stronger. Not knowing when it will morph is hard. The pain won\u2019t go away, so don\u2019t wait for that\u200a\u2014\u200ajust know that it will change and you will change with it. Your perspective over time will help you feel as you are\u200a\u2014\u200astrong, intelligent, worthy and beautiful. Thank you for joining TGM. I am looking forward to more of your work. -Cyborg ", "title": "", "parent": "1228", "creatorid": "72168947bef4", "id": "f68e1159654b"}
