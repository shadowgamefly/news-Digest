{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "aa8d274d899d", "content": "Working in an academic environment, where getting published is the ne plus ultra and sine qua non of your existence, the tension between research and writing constitutes an ever-present danger. Some colleagues have discovered the magical point where they have carried out just enough research to keep reviewers of their work at bay, and as a result they have many publications. Others are paralyzed by the thought that there is some essential reference that they have yet to discover, that will ultimately lead to their work being rejected by dismissive peers. Their publication record is dismal, and often when they do send something out, it is rejected for being out of date. Neither of these positions is ideal. Too little output suggests that you are inadequate to the task (perhaps a better teacher than researcher), while too much output suggests that you are a scam artist (all flash, little substance). Remind me again why I chose to be an academic. ", "creatorid": "8751db91c583", "name": "1951_1", "parent": "1951"}
