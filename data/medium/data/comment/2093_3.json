I remember being young applying for a job there as a news photog. So so very much wanted to work there. They had a swimming pool! I didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019d have to work in the area for over 15 years before I got in there as an engineer. I loved it! And then the world started going to shit in 2008. I started to see my job and everything about \u201cthe media\u201d as a poison to our democracy and society. The place I aspired to work in the 90s later revealed itself as just another churn of bread and circuses. \u201cNews.\u201d Whatever. Its local TV like this place and every other that keep criminals in office. Instead of really investigating these maniacs we now call \u201cleaders,\u201d they only ask softball questions so they can keep \u201caccess\u201d to these monsters. If reporters don\u2019t play nice, the competition will. \u201cAccess denied\u201d if you have a rep for hardball. You won\u2019t get past the gatekeepers. Never watch local news if you want the real story. Unless it\u2019s a story about how legitimate protesters are \u201crioting.\u201d The People are always an easy target. We have no gate keepers to worry about. We\u2019re all dime a dozen in their lens. They work for The Power. Not the constitution. So yeah, be careful what you wish for in a career. Put it into the universe long enough, it will show up for you. Whether it\u2019s what you really want when it does, though, can either be joy or absolute dissolution. I don\u2019t even attempt long term career goals anymore. Right now I write. I\u2019m going to until I can no longer afford to or it starts paying me. Very few of us stay the same person decade to decade. I\u2019m no where near the same man I was 20 years ago. Nothing lasts forever. Certainly not philosophy or worldview for those paying attention and making necessary survival adjustments from the zeitgeist. We all compromise to our conditions. Sometimes it's a compromise toward what\u2019s better for our souls instead of what pays the bills. Whichever direction alleviates the most pain usually wins. We spend a lot of time at \u201cjobs\u201d or the work we choose. Our time is something no one can give us back. Our work must have rewards other than a paycheck. What is the point otherwise?
