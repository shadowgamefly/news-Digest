Warren Beatty should\u2019ve realized that they are presenting the award for the Best Picture. When he read the card that said Emma Stone, if he\u2019s not sure that the card is the right one (which he shouldn\u2019t be, as Best Picture and Best Actress are very different), he could easily look around for the organizer to make them realize their error, or make light of the situation by saying \u201cWell this is awkward I think I have the wrong envelope\u201d. Regarding your redesign, I like it, it\u2019s very clear. Left-aligning the card and changing the font size and contrast makes it so much better ", "title": "", "parent": "1013", "creatorid": "81e32f864774", "id": "f9d9df979441"}
