I have used the silk screen process with resist inks but these days its toner transferred to the pcb. The photo indicates you do good work at a resolution of 5/1000 inch or better. I do everything now as surface mount. Even with thru hole ICs\u2026.I just bend the leads so they are flat. The 0.045 inch drills break too easily. As you say, soldering is key. Flux is the most important thing, its like a magic elixer. That and keeping everything clean. Have you considered a re-flow oven? I have been collecting the parts for one for years. The heater wire from old toaster ovens, the thermocouples for 600F. Thanks for showing home built hardware on Medium. I should take some photos of my work and do a little article.
