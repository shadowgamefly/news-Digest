There are millions of things you can \u2018do\u2019 out there, for a living or for a hobby, but ultimately these things can\u2019t make us truly happy in themselves. It is the energy or attitude we bring to whatever we do that provides our purpose. This is for me where mindfulness comes into it. If we are mindful in what we do, how we do it, how we feel and think when we do it, then we come more from the \u2018no-body\u2019 than the \u2018some-body\u2019. In that way we come from a clearer, less ego driven place and from this place things flow better and feel better and we are more open to each and every \u2018now\u2019 moment anew. When we are trying to be \u2018some-body\u2019 then we are typically projecting our own agenda on to the \u2018now\u2019 moment rather than simply experiencing it. You ask have I found my purpose. I feel the more I practice mindfulness ironically the more I feel my purpose is to let go more and more of any purpose and just to be more present. That sounds like new age jargon, spiritual rubbish but it\u2019s true for me. In my experience this has brought me closer to a natural flow of life, to the Universe\u2019s agenda rather than my own. I find greater enjoyment in the things I do for a living and also for a hobby, where in the past these often felt unfulfilling. If I know anything for sure it is that our happiness, purpose, love acceptance etc are not out there. You can chase your dreams outside forever and ever. Inside is where you start to find these qualities, and then ironically the outside fits into place. You get to get in to get out. ", "name": "2196_2", "id": "db3bfd4b775c"}
