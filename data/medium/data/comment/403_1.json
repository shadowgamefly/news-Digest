{"name": "403_1", "child": "", "content": "I agree with much of what you\u2019ve said here. I\u2019ve doled out some of the same advice myself. However, what this line of thought always misses is that kids can and will often cheat nearly as easily even when given assignments with no \u201cright\u201d answer, or PBL-style assignments. Say you and a colleague have developed an essay prompt that asks for a personal literary response that ties the meanings of a given text to one\u2019s own life. That topic is not Googlable. Still, Miriam might write that essay in the fall trimester and then pass it off to her best friend Janet taking the same course in the Spring trimester. They\u2019re good friends. They share many of the same life experiences, and they know each other well enough to flub the rest. They\u2019ve successfully cheated on an \u201cauthentic\u201d assignment. What\u2019s more, they\u2019ve done it in a way that is grossly unethical but still might pass the \u201cnot cheating in the real world\u201d test, since Miriam is knowingly and willingly acting as Janet\u2019s ghost writer. Still, at the end of the day Janet has been robbed of the learning experience and has in no way demonstrated her own ability to analyze a text successfully or write coherently. The same sorts of things can happen with any sort of PBL project that doesn\u2019t require students to generate their own question (and even then, you better be checking \u201ctheir\u201d question and subsequent project against the ones submitted to the other teachers in your building last term). Cheating in the sense of students grabbing answers to low DOK tasks off the internet is not really the issue anymore for educators who are paying attention. When you need students to demonstrate that level of knowledge to you (and you definitely still sometimes DO as part of the learning process despite what the Edtech reps tell you) you require it be demonstrated in a time-constrained tech-less environment. It\u2019s not hard. The bigger problem is that 1:1 environments increase the ease, likelihood and prevalence of students cheating even on more authentic assignment types by passing work to one another. This ease is further exasperated by a learning environment that expects students to find answers to their own questions via the internet and via collaboration with their peers (approaches I wholeheartedly support, btw) in that it blurs the lines between acceptable and unacceptable \u201csharing.\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "403", "creatorid": "7b0a89bf81de", "id": "7794ac03b2dd"}
