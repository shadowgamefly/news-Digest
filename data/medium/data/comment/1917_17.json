Capela shares the floor with 3 knockdown shooters and harden. Kanter and Dre didn\u2019t get better because no matter what Westbrook does, he can\u2019t change the kinetic profile of Enes Kanter to transform him into something more than a chair on D. Or teach him how to shoot wide open 3s. As for Roberson, he can\u2019t dribble, he can\u2019t shoot and he is extremely shaky in contested finishes at the rim. He is a good cutter and that\u2019s the only thing he does in offense on a level above YMCA. What did you expect from him? I\u2019m honestly baffled by this. As for Oladipo, he\u2019s not a good enough shooter (never was, not even on open 3s) to take the step forward. He\u2019s not Bradley Beal and he never was profiled to be. His true calling card was his D, which was merely good this year all while guarding the second best wing. And he is undersized which forbids him from truly bothering guys like Klay, Harden or small forwards. As for his driving game, again it comes down to spacing. He is not an elite ball handler and he is not that big, so to try and operate around Dre, Taj and Russ isn\u2019t even better than his situation in Orlando. The thing with okc that you keep forgetting is that all those breakout guys \u201cshone\u201d around two very good shooting forwards with an excellent defensive profile in Durant and Ibaka. That\u2019s a totally different ecosystem and it\u2019s ignorant to expect a leap from clearly flawed players in new surroundings that don\u2019t even come close to a good fit. I can get behind the narrative that the Thunder were built to win with defense but their rating wasn\u2019t anywhere close to elite. They weren\u2019t like a top-3 defense and definitely had horrendous stretches against bad teams. Plus, thanks for greatly taking into account the late game dominance of Russ other than one mention in the first 3 paragraphs. ", "creatorid": "dca7619f1d8b", "name": "1917_17", "parent": "1917"}
