{"name": "317_4", "child": "", "content": "Good post, Darius, and full of wisdom. When I was first getting published, I thought I had to learn\u2014and use\u2014everything on social media to get the word out. I wanted to be noticed, reviewed, on the tips of everyone\u2019s tongue. Only I started to forget what my business\u2014my real opportunity is\u2014and that\u2019s writing fiction (humorous fiction). It\u2019s taken 40 years to get any good, and I realized it would probably take 40 more to be really good. That made me ponder exactly what you\u2019re talking about: Where do we put our time and energy? Put it into your craft. Get good, hopefully get really good. It won\u2019t happen chasing a multitude of opportunities. I learned that the hard way. ", "title": "", "parent": "317", "creatorid": "870c6bc39de8", "id": "b79976191c92"}
