{"content": "The problem with this idea is simple: The same odds-makers that picked OKC to win a very accurate 45ish games\u200a\u2014\u200athey also had Westbrook at 4\u20131 odds of being MVP. That means that when they picked the Thunder to win those games, they thought it would happen almost entirely on the back of Westbrook. The fact that they got it so right might just accelerate the argument FOR Westbrook. After all, they already thought it would take an MVP season from Westbrook for them to get to 45.5 wins and they will finish 0.5\u20131.5 games ahead of that. That means Westbrook was even better than their 4\u20131 odds prediction. ", "child": "", "parent": "28", "title": "", "creatorid": "8ac7adbee04c", "name": "28_2", "id": "448c346beb0a"}
