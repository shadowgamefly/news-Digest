{"name": "33_10", "child": "", "content": "Edit: per comment suggestion [my own attempt to not be patronizing] I really enjoyed your rhetorical style. There have been a lot of articles written on this topic, but yours was probably one of the most fun I\u2019ve read. I\u2019ve done a lot of time researching on this topic. I didn\u2019t want to put in this response, this was supposed to be more fun with only a few facts. I have more of those facts in a response to a response of this article. I\u2019ll post that link at the end of this one in case one wants to keep following along with more thoughts, e.g. athleticism over time. Back to the post I wrote: For fun and gesturing, I\u2019d like to flip this on it\u2019s head, that is transport Westbrook back to 1962 and the Big O to today. A few tongue in cheek things on traveling Westbrook would have 8\u201312 travels called per game. Well, it\u2019s Westbrook, nevermind, he might only have 8\u201310 possessions that aren\u2019t called traveling. He barely even dribbles when getting inbound passes. I\u2019m kidding\u2026kinda. But seriously, traveling\u2026 This is today\u2019s NBA in terms of what\u2019s allowed for traveling:  And even last night, Steph Curry\u2019s double dribble traveling call is \u201clauded\u201d instead of called:  Here\u2019s some Westbrook if you will, one that was actually called. He\u2019s had another just like it that was NOT called.  Had enough of the fun of traveling. Let\u2019s now travel in time\u2026(see what I did there? Sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.) But taking Westbrook back to 1962, he\u2019d actually earn some of those \u201cfree\u201d rebounds his big men are giving him. He\u2019d probably average perhaps 12 rebounds. But assists, oo00f, today\u2019s game is very generous by comparison. He\u2019d probably average only 6\u20137 apg. Westbrook shoots 42.5% today in a game where the average is 45.7%. Oscar shot 47.8% when the league average was 42.6%. Westbrook would probably shoot about 38% when adjusted. Robertson, if transported forward would shoot about 55%. Westbrook would also lose just over 2 ppg as 3pt\u2019s only count for two in 1962. Ouch. The Big O coming to 2017 would get more assists in today\u2019s NBA. He\u2019d probably average 11\u201313 without breaking a sweat. He would still get a lot of possessions as during the \u201cbreak neck\u201d pace possessions were spread around more than they are today where teams make sure their stars have a high \u201cusage rate (%)\u201d of possessions. As far as scoring goes, if you take out the super outlier, Wilt Chamberlain, scoring averages of the top players from the 60\u2019s to today is about the same. 28\u201333 ppg. Jordan, possibly another outlier, got to 37 ppg. So I wouldn\u2019t add any more points to Robertson\u2019s total. Robertson would lose rebounds if he came to 2017, probably would still average 7\u20138 rpg tho. Maybe, he too, like Westbrook, would have teammates who yielded him 2.2 rpg to tack onto his average to get a triple-double season. My 1962 prediction for Westrbrook with the adjusted FG%, no 3pt\u2019ers, would probably average 26\u201328 ppg, 10\u201312 rpg, and 6\u20137.5 apg while shooting 36\u201340% year over year. Not bad at all. Robertson would probably look more like LeBron\u2019s numbers, but maybe a little drop in scoring with those 10\u201312 apg year over year. Maybe peak 13+ as Stockton did for a number of years. 24\u201327 ppg, 6\u20138 rpg, 11\u201313 apg. As far as video highlights go, it\u2019s unfortunate we have so little from the 1960\u2019s. It\u2019s estimated we have at most about 6% of Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s games. None of his 40 point games. Chamberlain played 1045 games. He had 271 games in which he scored 40+\u2026over 25% of his games. None, yes, none are available (or exist at all) to fans. And most of those 6% are when Chamberlain was, by comparison, in the twilight of his career. Much of the same it is with the Big O. For much of the 1960s, ABC only televised Sunday afternoon games, including during the NBA Playoffs, per Wikipedia. And yes, Oscar could most definitely dunk, he had a major spill at one point, so he didn\u2019t. Plus those Chuck Taylors!?! Damn! Here\u2019s him jumping for a block.  here\u2019s an article on those Chuck Taylor\u2019s\u2026.awful awful shoes [for basketball].
