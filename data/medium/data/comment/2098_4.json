First I thought I was lazy, then anxious, then I got physically ill, then more anxious, and ultimatelly depressive. When I was finally diagnosed with depression I was so <censored>. It was to late for an easy recovery. I lost my job as a direct consequence. Then I got it back through negotiatons and explaining I was ill. I am very convinced that my bosses don\u2019t have any idea of how it is like not being able to send one few words long email. And that being the only thing I managed the whole day before I escaped home for more convenient self torture. People just don\u2019t understand. And since there is actually nothing wrong with you physically they think you are just not pushing it hard enough, and with a little more effort you should make it. How incredibly wrong. They don\u2019t know you are pushing it 120 percent and you are fighting for your life. Without saying a word, you, the silent hero were winning your inner battles, but loosing those on the outside. I remember quitting Facebook. The superficiality would finish me off. Thank you for your extraordinary work. I really mean it. ", "name": "2098_4", "id": "eef496e55178"}
