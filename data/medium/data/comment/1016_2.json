Wireframes, once upon a time, used to be a detailed specification document that outlines the exact behaviour of all aspects of an app/site. Now and again I still find people who make them and have to say\u200a\u2014\u200astop! Wireframes, in essence, are about working out the overall interaction design without having to get things pixel perfect. They can be sketches or, they can be rough prototypes with colour, logos and \u2018placeholder\u2019 design where things roughly work. The days of wireframes being grey boxes created in OmniGraffle (or worse balsamiq) I hope are dead. It is about getting the right fidelity to test and communicate with the team without sweating too much over the final design.
