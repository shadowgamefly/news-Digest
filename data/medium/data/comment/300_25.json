{"name": "300_25", "child": "", "content": "Excellent, Jeff. I do something similar. I put my ideas down on 3 x 5 cards. Then pull one out and write a short chapter. I\u2019m working either on a novella or novel (right now I can\u2019t tell which) and each 500 word exercise is a chapter in the book. I know the themes and the characters so am writing with that in mind. Hopefully, by the time I reach the end of my cards, I\u2019ll be well on my way to completing the work.", "title": "", "parent": "300", "creatorid": "bbf48fe67e53", "id": "69f3ee07f128"}
