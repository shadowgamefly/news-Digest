{"name": "1771_24", "child": "", "content": "In this, and in other recent posts by boyd that I\u2019ve read, the author takes on knotty, important issues and problems and analyzes them at some length. I find these analyses interesting and often illuminating. Yet, when the pieces end, I find myself dissatisfied\u200a\u2014\u200abecause despite the trenchant analysis, there is rarely more than a single, general paragraph devoted to ways of overcoming, solving, or addressing the concerns raised in the body of the piece. In addition to this lack of specificity, there are no examples provided of existing situations, projects, or experiments in which readers may discern promising practices toward amelioration. It is not a particularly difficult thing to point out where we are stumbling and failing (we do so much of it), it is quite another to try to improve things. I look forward to when boyd focuses her numerous gifts more on healing our wounds and less on illuminating them in the written equivalent of gaudy technicolor. It\u2019s time, sister.
