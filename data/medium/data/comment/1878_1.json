{"name": "1878_1", "child": "", "content": "To answer the question of why the NB-IoT pricing in China is so low, my view is that it was due to its very large scale of usage. Aside from large-scale deployment of IoT-enabled electrical meters, water meters, shared bikes, etc., NB-IoT SIM cards are also commonly used in dual-SIM consumer cellphones for providing low-bandwidth data services due to their low cost. China has 1.28 billion cellphones by 2016, so it easily translates into huge number of NB-IoT SIM cards. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to see that such high degree of adoption not only lowers cost, but also further drives the development of all kinds of IoT-related technologies. The competitive advantage coming out of this is indeed quite significant. ", "title": "", "parent": "1878", "creatorid": "ec881027d0fb", "id": "2027d8c47c19"}
