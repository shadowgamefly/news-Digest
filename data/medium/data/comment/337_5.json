{"name": "337_5", "child": "", "content": "Well my opinion, and note it\u2019s not from a seasoned Investors, VC firm. But from someone who as now a second-time entrepreneur, or business owner, I follow the news, read, and my feel was that there was a lot of talk about there being a bubble. However, the opinion I formed was that on the contrary tech was great, and like I heard Scott Sandell in a keynote at Stanford in August last year, he said tech innovations have traditionally happened not all at the same time but what he was seeing that now tech innovation were happening concurrently and he believed that mobile, practically free computing any industry was up for disruption. He did, however, think that there as a valuation bubble. Series A doubled in 1 year, late stage up 50%. https://youtu.be/d0NrF6C-wJ8 So the market has corrected itself, true, valuations will be more in line with the startup, its stage, etc. I am sure as I read on Marks post he will give real data and will see if the opinion I formed was ok or not ok. For me it makes more sense: Startups IMHO should grow into their valuations. I tend to advise some startups I mentor and some I advice to not get too stubborn on valuations, leaving some equity at the table will not have such a dilution effect as many believe and concentrate more on Liq Prefs, Control, basically VC\u2019s try and minimize downside and maximize up side. I believe this should cut both ways. Many call VC investments marriages. So the contrary to what many VC\u2019s said years ago \u201cyou set the price we set the terms\u201d I wouldn\u2019t go as far as turning the saying, well because VC\u2019s will not do it, but would try and reach a more balanced deal\u00a0, Price in the first round, if you succeed will be set at later stages. Thanks! Mark always great content. ", "title": "", "parent": "337", "creatorid": "e473d49e8cce", "id": "bcac871bea72"}
