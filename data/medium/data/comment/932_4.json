{"name": "932_4", "child": "", "content": "Hi Erin, thanks for your question! You know, as I read your question the answer that popped most in my head was \u201cit depends\u201d. I mean, it seems like you\u2019re saying \u201csince it\u2019s not fair for either my roommate or I to live near work, we\u2019ll both compromise and live further\u201d. Which I guess is the honorable thing to do? So then the answer becomes \u201cit depends\u201d. It depends on whether or not both roommates are looking for jobs closer to where they live. It depends on how \u201clengthy\u201d the lengthy commutes are (I spoke about riding bikes to work yesterday which would save a ton of money). It depends on how \u201cnonexistent\u201d the public transportation is (which I can totally understand since I had to use public transportation in LA to get to school when I first moved there and didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license\u2026 It was extremely annoying because the city is so spread out I\u2019d have to take two buses and ride one cab. Every day. If I had a car back then I\u2019d absolutely have used that option) It depends on whether or not you\u2019re just making excuses (which, FYI I don\u2019t think you are. Your concerns seem to be legit vs someone yesterday who commented \u201coh my commute is only 4 miles away so spending money on gas isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d\u2026 Sure\u2026 If you haven\u2019t done the math) I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve considered all the options\u00a0:) So there\u2019s nothing I can say/ add.
