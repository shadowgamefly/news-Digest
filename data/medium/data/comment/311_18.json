{"name": "311_18", "child": "", "content": "I spent a lot of time and energy thinking\u00a0\u2026 and worrying. When I grew older, I worried about being old, sick and poor until I cracked up. It took a while to realize that pills and therapy weren\u2019t going to help. I\u2019d have to do it myself. I read about chronic anxiety, took classes, talked to people and finally I knew what I had to do\u2026 RETRAIN MY BRAIN! Every time negative thoughts took over, I went outside in my yard, sat under a tree with my dog, watched the squirrels scamper and the birds fly and the grass grow, and lived in that moment. I abandoned those old paths in the brain and gradually made new ones. It took nearly five years, but it worked for me. I AM old, sick and poor but it doesn\u2019t bother me any more and I am content on the NOW. ", "title": "", "parent": "311", "creatorid": "424227088a76", "id": "f6002425e267"}
