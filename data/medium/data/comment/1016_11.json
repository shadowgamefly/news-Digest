It might be that our definition of a wireframe is different that yours. It may seem unnecessary, but it could help readers understand exactly what you are talking about. For us, wireframing is sketching out the layout, workflows, and interactions of a given solution tied to the use cases or requirements given. We generally do this collaboratively. By doing so, it helps us create a clear picture of what is being built as well as uncover all of the details or problems that we might run into. We then use these as the building blocks for our prototypes. We have also used wireframes in testing before as well and it has helped us uncover gaps and additional questions to answer.
