{"name": "443_8", "child": "", "content": "I was a fan of Richard Feynman for over 20 years until he made the following statement: \u201cWe have to accept nature as it is\u200a\u2014\u200aabsurd.\u201d As far as I\u2019m concerned, nature is perfect. If physics makes it appear absurd, then it\u2019s physics that\u2019s absurd not nature. He\u2019s probably referring to the findings of Quantum Mechanics (QM). Einstein is half correct when he said that QM is not incorrect but it\u2019s incomplete. It may be incomplete but it\u2019s definitely incorrect. That\u2019s why it portrays nature as absurd. I mean the electron splitting in 2, going through both slits at the same time, interfere with each other, and produce an interference pattern. I mean really, the electron splitting? Really! Everything else about Feynman is OK though. ", "title": "", "parent": "443", "creatorid": "d28cc8d8f7fc", "id": "d810ed141452"}
