{"content": "just consider that not all forms of human power are the formal ones of government, law, business etc. in which males are dominant. A brilliant observation, albeit one which illustrates well how frustrating it is to be compelled to state the obvious. All along, like since the sixties, the primary guttural reaction I have seen to feminist dogma and grievance-fabricating, has begun with some version of \u201cWhat? Seriously?\u201d More often than not too, this reaction has come from women in my purview, sort of an aghast shock at the idea of settling for \u201cequality\u201d when women, as you point out, have pretty much been in charge of men\u2019s lives all along. What makes me just laugh at feminist ideology, is the idea of women too weak to claim their own birthright of power over men and use it effectively, and their pet men too limp-wristed in their disability of hyper-addiction to female approval by any means necessary, to have the plain tact to point this out to them. The real secret to decoding the feminist mindset, is that it is authored by women who clearly hate being women. If they didn\u2019t, they would bother to learn how to operate the machinery the way it was designed, which has little trouble managing maleness when deployed effectively.
