I\u2019m apprehensive of any medical professional who would psychoanalyze a \u2018patiant\u2019 based on random public appearances. The same way I wouldn\u2019t trust a programmer who criticized a piece of software, without actually looking at the source code for that system. Quite frankly, it\u2019s amateurish. Most of Trump behavior were meant to sensationalize and draw attention and not necessarily a part of his character. A professional should recognize and understand this. Of course, this was mainly a political statement, rather than an actual concern over Trump administration. ", "title": "", "parent": "1383", "creatorid": "f6b2460fde5", "id": "e83793291587"}
