I would tell him and I do not care if I am on his \u201clist\u201d, I would wear it as a badge of honor. Please, please, put me on the list! He won no election, he has no mandate. As far as I am concerned he is invalid. I know there are the naysayers who would have us believe we should be meek and mild and \u201cgive him a chance\u201d. Guess what I would say to that? When pigs fly. He is a foul human being who would be nothing were it not for money and truth be told he probably does not have much of that. His foundation is a joke, he has been in bankruptcy like a revolving door and in my considerate opinion he will more than likely take kickbacks from foreign governments because he cannot pass up a chance to take someone\u2019s money. He ain\u2019t proud, he\u2019ll take anyone\u2019s money. He makes a mockery of the office of President. I will not respect him or his cronies, I will resist every chance I get even if it means only writing comments on this site. Shame on the republicans for letting him get in office, whatever havoc he wreaks will be on their heads. Tell all the folks who depend on medicare and social security who voted for him to kiss their benefits goodbye. Tell the military families to say goodbye now, their family members will be gone a lot. He is saving Carrier jobs and crashing Boeing and Lockheed-Martin. Our progress in racism and women\u2019s rights are now back in 1950. My country is in deep doo-doo.
