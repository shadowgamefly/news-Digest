Or did I miss something? \u201c\u2026. the day she saw the light in Carl\u2019s eyes for the last time\u2026.\u201d This was one of the most powerful phrases of the story. It reminds me of the movie, Collateral Beauty, which I recently watched and which I very highly recommend. It\u2019s a story about a man\u2019s reaction to the loss of his child. Your story highlighted one of the themes from this movie and that is the importance of talking and interacting with others in the grieving process. Kudos to you. I look forward to the next installment in this story of two unlikely friends. ", "title": "", "parent": "1288", "creatorid": "40abe946fcd0", "id": "a7796c9cf3fe"}
