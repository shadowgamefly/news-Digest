The conclusion I\u2019ve reached is that internet marketing is not inherently bad, it is just a tool. There is hope for us too: internet consumers are getting more internet-savvy, and more discerning, all the time. Speaking personally, I think the road to ruin starts with wanting success to come fast, and believing the internet marketer hype around selling their latest \u2018how-to\u2019 product. We are all suckers for a shortcut to success. Unfortunately the breed of marketer you talk of is motivated purely by money, not service, whatever they say (including to themselves). So they keep moving onto the latest fad tactic (another webinar or FB live video anyone?) touting the same old stuff, but the newness of the \u2018medium\u2019 (no offence to Medium!) lends some freshness and a feeling of \u2018authenticity\u2019 so that people get sucked in. I\u2019ve been sorely tempted to throw out the internet marketing bath water. But I have realised that whilst I\u2019d feel better if I did, the baby would be gone too. I don\u2019t know the answer, but I feel your pain! ", "name": "2202_10", "id": "5cb388e8cf4a"}
