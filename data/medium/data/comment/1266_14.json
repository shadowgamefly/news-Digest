I\u2019ve recently made the hard commitment: I\u2019m going to move to Seattle by June 10th, 2017, job or no job. It\u2019s a scary thought, but I think it\u2019s also cleared my head and clarified my goal. I also thankfully have a decent safety net in Seattle and plenty of savings to make it all work. But even if I didn\u2019t, I think I would still set the exact same goal. Thanks for your writing Ben (do you mind if I call you Ben?). It\u2019s really be inspiring me lately!
