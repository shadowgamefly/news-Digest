That was sarcasm, as much of what he was suggesting fits the profile of most politicians. If you\u2019ve decided any criticism of your leader is political, then you won\u2019t be swayed, but really, this guy\u2019s different. I don\u2019t like Trump. In many ways, he is a caricature, an amusing joke of what an American president is. That being said, this was not a criticism, there was no pointing to any flaws in particular, but instead taking vague characteristics and applying them with a very broad brush. It is the same idiotic \u2018criticism\u2019 of labeling those you oppose as vile and disgusting. It might sound good in your head, but just makes you sound like a child throwing a tantrum.
