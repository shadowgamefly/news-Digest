{"name": "1734_2", "child": "", "content": "Excellent point raised here Emma. For many years I spent more time at the office than at home. For crying out loud I even had keys for the building and a security code, and was not part of the management team. I worked constantly, trying to always be one step ahead of\u00a0\u2026\u2019no one but myself\u2019. I was afraid of pausing, for fear I would lose an opportunity. Eventually, I was promoted into a department and \u2018sick building' which I was severely allergic to. When I finally left the job, it was hard to unwind, and breathe. I had to learn how to breathe and pause. I am a strong advocate for employees taking breaks\u00a0daily to connect with themselves. Lunch break is important, eating is important, and breathing is necessary. ", "title": "", "parent": "1734", "creatorid": "2acd7a8df625", "id": "8769526b4c9d"}
