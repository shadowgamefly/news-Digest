{"name": "869_19", "child": "", "content": "I think it\u2019s interesting that Pepsi needs to apologize in a manner you want them to in order for it to truly be an apology. I remember once being told by a black activist that my belief that black lives matter rioting, looting, targeting whites for death, along with cops not being protesting was presumptuous in that I was believing that black lives matters should be protesting in a socially acceptable white manner. Pepsi\u2019s apology might not have been appropriate or enough for you, but is that just presumption on your part that they apologize how you want them to, or how they feel they should?
