As nice as libraries like Chess JS are, going into more depth about how bitboards work and generating movements from that would be more interesting, especially to non-JS developers. More advanced topics include Pondering and (what I\u2019d be most interested in) Magic BitBoards. ", "title": "", "parent": "1668", "creatorid": "e2ccfc311d48", "id": "59ddbd16d11f"}
