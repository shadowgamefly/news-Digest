{"name": "1882_4", "child": "", "content": "While I think it\u2019s wonderful you\u2019re trying to be more conscious of how others may have felt in the past, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of you to assume full responsibility for someone else feeling weak and insignificant. If you\u2019re talking about immigrant communities in particular, very often it\u2019s their families and ones close to them who often make them feel the same. I know it\u2019s an uncomfortable topic to discuss, but if we want to understand why people don\u2019t engage fully in our societies, we can\u2019t continue to ignore the fact that the homes and backgrounds a lot of minorities come from aren\u2019t always as warm and fostering as we\u2019d like to imagine, and this flows over into other aspects of their lives too, particularly school and the workplace. I know you\u2019re trying to minimize the impacts of your actions by being more aware and making sure you don\u2019t get drunk off your power. And that\u2019s very much needed too. I\u2019m just trying to provide another perspective to this particular problem. ", "title": "", "parent": "1882", "creatorid": "237366146a2f", "id": "8b265eb1a5d8"}
