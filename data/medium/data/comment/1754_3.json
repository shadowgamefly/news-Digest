{"name": "1754_3", "child": "", "content": "Thank you, Heidi, for this wonderful nugget of inspiration! I intend to take it to heart and blog more. I\u2019ve been working on a novel for young people and oddly, I find the process of writing a book seemingly more easy than blogging\u00a0\u2026 perhaps because I am so new to blogging. To me, blogging feels like an on-going round of cocktail parties\u00a0\u2026 each blog being a different party where one must be witty and wise or instructional and inspirational, and/or so many other things. But, in any event, your encouragement of just do it is excellent advice. So, thanks, again. P.S. I love your writing!
