I\u2019d like to add an additional item to the \u201cPurpose\u201d block, related to the \u201cConquest/Expansionism\u201d choice, but different. In the sci-fi novel Three Body Problem by prodigious Chinese novelist Liu Cixin, an alien civilization comes to Earth for purposes solely related to self defense. Saying any more would give too much away to folk who haven\u2019t read it yet, but I\u2019d consider self defense an entirely different motivation vs. conquest.
