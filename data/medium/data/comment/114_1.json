{"name": "114_1", "child": "", "content": "I think the lesson of this year is that you can\u2019t have this many poor defensive players at the same time. Changing the pieces that surround the poor defenders is just cosmetic. Instead of trying to decide what he is worth, trade Melo for whatever you can get as long as you aren\u2019t taking back salary. Rose is going to sign somewhere. It behooves him and whoever eventually signs him to go for a test drive. I would ask his agent to talk to other teams and see who would consider signing him as a free agent and look to trade him to one of those teams. It gives a bad team a chance to sell him on their team and it gives him a chance to show the team what he can do with their roster. Anyone would pause at a max contract but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll play somewhere and allowing the search and interviews to start now might net us an interesting return. Even if we traded Melo and Rose for some expiring contracts and some very high draft picks the rebuild might be quick as you get the players you draft and whatever you get for the cap space you free up. Melo, Jennings & Straukas to Cleveland Love to Boston Rose & Shumpert to Philly The Nets and Philly #1 draft picks to the knicks as well as some expiring contracts to allow the numbers to work while those three teams shuffle a few players between them to make the value even out. The knicks get a little worse this year and get into the lottery but then get 3 lottery picks in a pretty deep draft.
