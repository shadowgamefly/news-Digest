{"name": "1617_7", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for your honesty and bravery in sharing Tanya\u2019s story and yours. I am so very sorry for your loss, which I can empathize with more than I care to since my own wife died of liver disease at age 56 (she was six months older than Tanya) on January 19, in an ICU in a specialty hospital in San Antonio. Like Tanya, my wife was a brilliant and talented performer (a classical and jazz musician) who grew up in northern NJ and had graced many stages in NYC and NJ. We also had two young sons, who are now just 11. Our 13th wedding anniversary would have been next week. My wife was also the victim of medical incompetence and misdiagnosis over an extended period. I am sure neither Tanya nor my wife would want to be remembered as a critically ill patient in a hospital bed, but your story is helping me find my own closure and serve as a reference point for friends who might want to know more details about this terrible ordeal. I wish us both peace. ", "title": "", "parent": "1617", "creatorid": "3b77c12ccf90", "id": "70c29ad97bc"}
