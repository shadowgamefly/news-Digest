{"name": "1773_8", "child": "", "content": "Hi Benjamin- great question. Herman and Chomsky\u2019s analysis is fantastically specific, and that specificity is a limitation. Despite the moniker of \u201cthe propaganda model,\u201d Herman and Chomsky were putting forward a (-n incisive) critique of the US media in a particular moment. It\u2019s not a particularly useful model for systematic critique of other contexts, as John Corner pointed out in 2003 (see his \u201cThe Model in Question\u201d in the European Journal of Communication 18:3, pp. 367\u2013375). What\u2019s more, media institutions, practices, and economic pressures have changed profoundly since Manufacturing Consent was published in 1988; the economic and practical pressures of gaining and defending broadcast market share are quite different from the economic and practical pressures imposed by a social media context of clicks, likes and shares. With that being the case, I see Herman and Chomsky more as methodological role models than analytic model-makers. ", "title": "", "parent": "1773", "creatorid": "3db4d0163874", "id": "1c45627ca41"}
