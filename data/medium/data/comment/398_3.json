{"name": "398_3", "child": "", "content": "While I love the idea of your article, I do see a hole in your story and I\u2019d like to know what you think: Rich people have more resources to farm out the \u201cdaily living tasks\u201d, such as getting food or taking care of children, than poor people. This allows them to invest more hours per day in profitable activities. So Time is, after all, not the great equalizer. Opportunity costs, then. Your Warren Buffet example works, as far as I can see. Also: he can afford to spend his time in a suboptimal way every once in a while since he is stinking rich already. But a poor person might not be able to invest in a high-gain opportunity since those are usually high-risk. They might need to play it safe and thereby just getting by. An opportunity may cost more for Warren Buffet\u00a0in\u00a0absolute\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0dollars, but he can deal with the consequences far more easily than a poor or even middle-class person.
