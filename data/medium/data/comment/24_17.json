That would eliminate Westbrook, in my opinion, because the way that OKC plays augments his individual production while simultaneously decreasing their odds of postseason success (I think they would win more games, and have a better chance of postseason success, if he worked harder to include/optimize his team-mates. And yes, it\u2019s not just on him, it\u2019s on his coaches as well). His personal feats are truly astounding, but the point of basketball isn\u2019t to record amazing individual statistics, it\u2019s to try to win. Anyway, just a thought I had. (Note\u200a\u2014\u200aI am NOT a Westbrook hater, I\u2019ve been enjoying his game since he came into the league). ", "title": "", "parent": "24", "creatorid": "2a3f11146e8f", "id": "e011f8941d54"}
