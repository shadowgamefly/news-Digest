I\u2019ve read studies about how only 16% of people who downloaded an app will give it a third try if they found it hard to use. 80\u201390% of downloaded apps are used once and then abandoned. So it seems a conscious decision to make an app obscure to use, to appeal to \u201chipsters\u201d might also be a decision to limit the market for your app. Not for me to say if that\u2019s worth the tradeoff, but interesting thing to think about. Is it a conscious choice or less-than-ideal UX masquerading as exclusiveness? ", "title": "", "parent": "723", "creatorid": "e5a420850009", "id": "4e021d5ebae3"}
