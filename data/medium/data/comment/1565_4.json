{"name": "1565_4", "child": "", "content": "I never see any criticism about Gorush as a SC nominee, only about the process in confirming him. Why is that? And if you want to again write about the hypocrisy of a Republicans then what about Schumer? He said this last June \u201cSenate Republicans need to do their job and give Judge Garland the hearing and vote he deserves because the American people deserve a fully functioning court. Having a deadlocked, 4\u20134 court could lead to judicial chaos surrounding environmental protections, voting rights, and so many other issues that are important to everyday Americans. This delay has gone on long enough, it\u2019s time for the Senate to do the job we were elected to do.\u201d And just 6 months later he was interviewed by Rachel Maddow and he said Maddow argued that the Democrats should refuse to fill the empty seat for the entirety of Trump\u2019s four-year presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So you\u2019re right,\u201d he responded. \u201cAnd so you will do your best to hold the seat open?\u201d asked Maddow. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Schumer said. So in just 6 months Schumer went from claiming \u201cjudicial chaos\u201d if the 9th SC seat was not filled to saying he has no problem with leaving that 9th seat open for the next 4 years. That is absolutely bizarre ", "title": "", "parent": "1565", "creatorid": "646615db4e96", "id": "29234f40f7d"}
