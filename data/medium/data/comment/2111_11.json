But, unlike mostly anything else we learn in this place, time, society, and cultural environment we live in, is that the irony of it is: \u201cdon\u2019t do it because of the results\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t chase any goals. Do it just for the sake of doing it. No expectations. Breath, meditate, and be there, just that.\u201d Your relation with the outcomes of meditation is like that with a butterfly: the more you chase it, the more it goes away from you\u200a\u2014\u200alook elsewhere, direct your focus to anything else (hint: your breathing) and before you know it, the butterfly comes to you by itself and sits right on your shoulder.
