{"id": "7edf7dfd56c5", "content": "Regarding the conclusion in your title, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. Yes, it could be that merely adding a question mark will get you more answers, but it\u2019s also entirely possible that questions which possess other traits (such as, for example, a clear problem statement or grammatically correct english) are statistically more likely to end with a question mark in the title, and it is those traits which increase the number of answers a question receives, not the presence of a question mark itself. In order to conclude that merely adding a question mark to the end of a question\u2019s title increases the number of answers received, you would have to somehow control for all these other competing factors.
