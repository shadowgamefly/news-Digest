{"name": "593_12", "child": "", "content": "I agree with a lot of these, especially the Apple Watch notes. I\u2019ve had mine since launch and I love it, but there are nagging issues that haven\u2019t gone away. Namely snappiness and far too many apps that have no purpose on a wrist. The app cloud is just a horrible paradigm. I think the side button doesn\u2019t need to be there as well. I love the wheel but every so often it gets\u2026 stuck. I like the idea of contextual watch faces, kind of like how Sailfish has ambiences. Anyway, great read. ", "title": "", "parent": "593", "creatorid": "e564a05e64c3", "id": "457e615688d3"}
