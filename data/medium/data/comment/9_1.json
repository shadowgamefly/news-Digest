{"id": "743e2f1deeeb", "content": "Great Article Sebastiaan, you know\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s your and Bjorn\u2019s total Apple fanboyism (for lack of a better word right now) that finally got me into Macs. Having been an avid PC user (and builder) for years before that. Although I joined the party a little late, it seems. After having purchased an iMac and buying the ill-fated Mac Pro halfway through 2014 when signs were there this machine wasn\u2019t going to be what its predecessors were. Still. I actually like the small form. Yet, the lack of updates had got me scratching my head. I jumped on the bandwagon a little bit too late, though I love the Apple universe (I have one of almost every device) it just doesn\u2019t come near to the raw power of a PC (of which I also still have one). My six-year-old PC-beast has a new GTX 1070 and is purring like a kitten fully stocked with RAM, even though the CPU and mobo are ageing. The case they\u2019re in is large and roomy and the power supply is so massive I worry I\u2019ll pop a plug when I turn it on. Still. It runs Windows 7 because it had been mothballed too long and I missed the free update to Win 10 window (haha, Windows-window, get it? Yeah.) And it has always felt\u2026 clunky. Cobbled together and barely hanging on, somehow. Although you can fiddle with just about everything, everything can break it, too. At friends\u2019 places who do have Win 10 I can\u2019t help but go \u201cegh, Windows\u201d how I do not miss that temperamental thing. The blue screens of death and inexplicable hangups when a deadline was looming drove me towards Apple. And I ain\u2019t going back to the insecurity of my Winblows machine. I loved it to bits and it\u2019s a fantastic games console, but too much is at stake right now for me to switch back to it. I do wish the new Mac Pro will be freaking awesome. An amazingly modular system that can grow along with hardware trends and look good\u200a\u2014\u200abut pragmatic\u200a\u2014\u200awhilst sitting proud on or under my desk. My trashcan puts up a good fight, though. Luckily I focus on 2d illustration and animation\u200a\u2014\u200anothing too processor or GPU intense. However expandability is something I\u2019ve started to crave more and more. If Apple does not deliver in 2018 I\u2019m afraid I might just have to jump off the bandwagon. And go back to fearing the BSoD, frantically backing up everything and renewing my virus scanner subscription. Egh, Windows.
