In assessing the importance of visual communication (still images and video) it would be interesting to see what kinds of images and what kind of visual storytelling dominate the different quadrants; for example, would the instagram-only person (ecosystem) be different than a Facebook/Facebook-instagram person (tribes) in the kinds of visuals they put into the environment? How does the desire for privacy, which is different in the Boomer generation vs Millennials, affect not only what they post in words but the images they share, and where, and why? Just some of the questions I have about what we can learn about people (in order to communicate more deeply) by understanding how they connect with each other.
