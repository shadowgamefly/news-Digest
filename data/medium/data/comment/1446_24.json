And I wish I could state falling on black ice and asphalt, having a humpty-dumpty body and dealing with an onset of a serious TBI, then subsequent 9 more TBIs was the best thing that ever happened to me, it was Hell! I thank my education for helping me to retrain myself for no one understood TBIs. What resonates and and I will march beside you is the sleep deprivation that came with recovery!! It took 8 months for me to learn to sleep, even with 37 years of meditation. To enjoy sleep!!! And to make this a habit in my life. That was the true recovery, from recovering from a devastating fall. The world changes!! And coming back has been a shocker. With the skin of \u201cAdaptation and Blood of Resilience\u201d I am slowly finding my place in life again, for my place in Life was ripped from me! Digging deep into those meditations and quiet moments, seeing entirely different avenues, and my horse and dog have been my salvation. You are one admirable lady Adriana and thank you for sharing such a moment of heart break and returning with wisdom to share with the world. Cheers MicheleElys ", "title": "", "parent": "1446", "creatorid": "3f6f7c2fa897", "id": "9da29b4aea3"}
