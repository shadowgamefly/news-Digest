{"content": "\u201cWhite folks, we don\u2019t get lynched. We don\u2019t have a clue what lynching is like,\u201d Lynching Statistics by Yearlaw2.umkc.edu Of course, these come from the biased Tuskegee Institute, so the numbers can be taken with a grain of salt. But even they admit that ~1 in 3 people lynched were white. So assuming that the numbers are accurate (they probably aren\u2019t, and likely exclude plenty of whites in addition to asians), in order to make a salient point about lynching being racist you would also have to take out those lynched in frontier areas with no law enforcement, those lynched due to upset cattle barons thinking their cows have been stolen, blacks lynched by other blacks, etc. I wonder what the real numbers would look like then? Lynching looks nothing like your picture. That\u2019s just what people who have no idea what lynching actually was think it looks like. You\u2019re right about the word being used in all the wrong ways. But you\u2019re wrong about it, too. By the way, its interesting you would use a case of (alleged) black on white rape for your insinuation about what lynching was. I wonder if you know how often that happens now that \u201clynching\u201d is out of vogue?
