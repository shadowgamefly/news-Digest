Anybody who sells firearms on a regular basis is required to hold a Federal Firearms License. Even historic gun collectors who sell more than a handful of guns a year are being required to get an FFL. All FFL holders are required to perform background checks on sales of firearms. Although individual sales don\u2019t require a background check, it\u2019s already illegal to knowingly sell a firearm to someone who you suspect isn\u2019t allowed to legally own a firearm, or to anyone who you suspect is buying the firearm for another individual. And you should browse the ATF\u2019s website if you don\u2019t believe there are strict federal regulations\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://www.atf.gov/questions-and-answers/firearms-qas ", "child": "", "id": "5c3efb5f069d", "title": ""}
