{"content": "You lost me at sentences like: \u201cRussia would appeal to former Soviet Bloc states.\u201d and: \u201cPutin could probably get easy wins early in Eastern Europe, and gobble up former Soviet states.\u201d That told me you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Most of those former Eastern Bloc countries can\u2019t stand Russia and would fight her bitterly. I know, because I\u2019ve lived and travelled there and had these conversations with the citizens of those countries. There is still bitter resentment over the USSR taking over their lands that is generations deep. My wife\u2019s family, for example, who had their 3rd generation family farm taken and were kicked off their land by the USSR\u2026 I don\u2019t think China would enter into a war, ( being a burgeoning capitalist state with too much trade with USA) unless they were dragged in. You\u2019d have a better chance making an argument about Middle Eastern Countries and other psychotic outliers like N. Korea, aligning together, or even with Russia. Anything is possible, (I mean, my God, one assassination started WWI), but this article seems to be little more than fear mongering based on wild conjecture.
