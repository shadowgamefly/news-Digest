{"name": "1422_7", "child": "", "content": "I was an avid Eatsa fan until today. When I walked up to order my bowl, I was completely thrown off by the new menu and the bowl that I wanted to order (the Falafel bowl) was no where to be seen in my list of choices (I even went to \u201ctraditional bowls\u201d and couldn\u2019t find it). Instead I was given SALAD choices not realizing that none of them had quinoa in them. I went for one that seemed tasty, mostly because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to see any of the other bowls and felt pressured to make a decision. Then the price came, and it was $14.99 for a salad half the size of any salad in the area with no protein and no quinoa in it. Is that a joke? I felt completely ripped off\u200a\u2014\u200aI just paid $15 for maybe a cup of spinach, 6 tiny balls of cheese, a tablespoon of vegetables and two dressings (is that where the extra $$ came from?!!?). Also, for an experience that is supposed to be \u201cpersonalized\u201d how can you not figure out how to show me the bowl I have literally ordered the last 5 times I\u2019ve been to Eatsa? And after eating my spinach and mozzarella bowl, while decent, was so small that I am still starving afterwards. And I paid more than most massive, already overpriced Mixt salads.
