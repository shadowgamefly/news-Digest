I think identifying the root cause of the stress and clarifying what is triggering you to feel this way is important. Next, just take it slow. 15 minutes a day if you can. Little bursts are key. Of course, I\u2019m not a doctor, but I get some anxiety about writing and I find that\u2019s what helps. It\u2019s when I blow it up too much, or lose sight of the enjoyment of the process because I\u2019m too focused on the end results when I fin my mind start to waver and slip. Hope that helps. let me know if I can support you in any other way. ", "creatorid": "d0feb9cb177b", "name": "1953_4", "parent": "1953"}
