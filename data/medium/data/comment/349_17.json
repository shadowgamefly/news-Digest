{"name": "349_17", "child": "", "content": "Dan, what a beautiful tribute to your grandfather. I loved every word and felt my heart open. I also have enjoyed reading others\u2019 comments. I lost my father recently after 10 years of saying goodbye to him in stages. Dementia is cruel but it allows us time for these goodbyes and that helps. I remember the last time I saw him, telling him all that he had meant to me. I am so glad I got that chance. Love lasts; love is the only thing that lasts. It is good for all of us alive at this moment to remember that. Thank you. ", "title": "", "parent": "349", "creatorid": "ac021a47c8f1", "id": "15ce4de0336b"}
