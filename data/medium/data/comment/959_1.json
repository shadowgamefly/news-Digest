{"name": "959_1", "child": "", "content": "Although he\u2019s not my cup of tea, Trump is far less of a misogynist than the Clintons. Well see if he\u2019s deposed for raping women before the election as Bill Clinton was. Do you think Trump would have the gall to lie to the grand jury about extra marital affairs while occupying the white house? Would Whoopie Goldberg come to his defense and claim \u201cit wasn\u2019t rape -rape\u201c for Trump as she did for Bill Clinton? Would the Republicans link arms to defend a rapist in the white house as the Democrats did? I hope at least one party has a moral spine. Where was the media when Bill Clinton was revealed as a serial rapist? Running the defense. Trump is far more LGBT friendly than the gay-hating Clintons ever were. Careful now these are alternative facts\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the kind which protrudes the thin fabric of sheltered reality.
