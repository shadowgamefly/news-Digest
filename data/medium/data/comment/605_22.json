{"name": "605_22", "child": "", "content": "All I read here is long article written by a greedy overpaid person who is trying to justify his own selfish decision. You\u2019ve been selling cameras for over 2'000 USD to your customers and now you\u2019re just going to drop them. Your business was not failing because of the camera\u2019s hardware or potential, it was solely because you were being selfish on behalf of essential functionality. While the hardware of an Illum was great, you were restricting the consumers to only use your services. You were taking honest people\u2019s money and not giving them what they deserve for it. The format the lightfield images were saved in should be open-sourced, so that 3rd party apps could offer advanced editing techniques and most important browsers could implement the format, making the sharing of lightfield images possible. Once the first people would be publicly publishing lightfield images, every photographer would have been eager to get one of your cameras.\u00a0Instead you locked down the format. If someone wanted to share an image online they had to use your iFrame integration. On most services like Facebook or Instagram this doesn\u2019t work, and even on webpages this is not a clean solution, as the page would always be dependant on your slow website. I sure hope your Immerse product fails horribly and you lose everything due to your greed. There are enough competitors out there that will offer similar solutions and probably will also have enough common sense to provide their solutions in a way that creates a plausible solution for their customers.
