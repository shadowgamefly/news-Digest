In my opinion, the focus on failure is misguided and leaves the impression that failure is \u201cgood\u201d. Instead I\u2019d like to see a greater emphasis on the scientific method way of thinking instead. Instead of the preoccupation on failure, we need a greater rigor in the startup experience on hypothesis testing. With this approach, the emphasis is on clarity of assumptions and the process founders use to test those assumptions and the outcome reflects incremental steps of confirmation (or not). That said, your blog sure sparked thought on the importance of the mindset that understands, accepts, and consequently learns from the consequential outcomes of the startup experience.
