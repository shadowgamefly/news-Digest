{"parent": "2462", "content": "If we\u2019re going to talk about maps in relation to society rather than plain old geography, how about some maps where areas are distorted so that equal displayed areas have equal populations? Wyoming would be a tiny little square. London would cover half of England. Greenland would be a dot, and the Sahara would be a thin strip between the mighty Empires of Lagos and Egypt. China and India would be as big as Africa. Now, let\u2019s do another one. Equal areas produce equal amounts of food. Now China and India remain large, but the U.S. swells to larger than either. Now, equal areas have equal incomes. Africa shrinks, Japan and Europe and the U.S. swell. South Korea bulks huge compared to North Korea. There could be dozens of such maps. Energy production. Solar energy potential. Wind energy potential. Carbon footprints. Each and every one of them politically incorrect, because every last map shows something and not some other thing instead which somebody would have liked to have included. Or excluded. But in aggregate, they\u2019d be very instructive.
