It is always nice to hear when people in our community have similar views on interviewing and hiring. Especially when those are aimed at giving someone an opportunity without making them jump through arbitrary hoops. One thing I love to add is a discussion around failures and successes. I have failed many times in my life and I continue to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. The dialogue, I feel helps break down the barriers that make interviews feel so us vs them.
