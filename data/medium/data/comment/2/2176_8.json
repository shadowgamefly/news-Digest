I enjoyed the last paragraph under When to Use What Method. It helped me understand the difference between a service blueprint and employees\u2019 feedback regarding a customer journey. Though the sentence \u201cA customer journey can only exist on what an organization can deliver; it is confined to and constrained by your internal capability.\u201d can probably be re-written. Customer Journeys do certainly contain a large number of experiences outside of those services provided by any one company. They are not so confined or constrained. That\u2019s actually how customer journey mapping can have a profound positive effect on improving & expanding a company\u2019s service blueprint. It is precisely because journey mapping habitually examines elements normally considered outside of the sphere of influence of the company\u2019s services that new discoveries and improvements can be found and (when appropriate) implemented.
