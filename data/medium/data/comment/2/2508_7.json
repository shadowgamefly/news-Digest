{"parent": "2508", "content": "Consider other scenarios as well. I think an oligopolistic market is a strong possibility as well\u200a\u2014\u200a2 to 4 (or so) winners, not just one. You assumption leans on the idea that Bitcoin & Ethereum are direct competitors; some have argued persuasively that Ethereum has additional functionalities and/or that different cryptcurrencies will continue to fragment into different protocols for different purposes. An analogy here might be the video game console market shared by Sony, MSFT, and Nintendo. Each platform is relatively differentiated and has shown the ability to support a core of loyal users and developers. Another analogy here might be the smartphone market, now dominated by 2 very successful platforms\u200a\u2014\u200aAndroid and iOS\u200a\u2014\u200abut successful for very different reasons. The switching costs among cryptocurrencies and other currencies is very low. This reduces the strength of network effects and makes it more difficult for one platform to dominate. In contrast, Facebook is a winner-take-all market largely because of high switching costs; you can try other competing software but you can\u2019t easily take your network of friends with you. Users are highly locked-in. I do think the market will eliminate weaker competitors. Here, negative network effects will kick in. To the extent that you view cryptocurrencies as commodities, what\u2019s the value add of of the market supporting an indefinite number of competitors? What\u2019s the incremental value added by #101? #1001? Not much, IMO. The smaller the market cap, the less liquid the currency, again working against network effects.
