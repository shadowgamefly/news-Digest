{"parent": "2460", "content": "Amazing background story that did a great job of weaving the many factors that became the motivations of a writer that most people would just take at face value. His success at writing fiction gave me the idea that he was a very creative storyteller. Now, your story has made me want to go back to read his novels to understand the way he took his experiences and wove them into his writing, the worlds and characters that he developed. Thanks!
