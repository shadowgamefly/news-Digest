Huge whiff on your assumption that Rey is Luke\u2019s daughter. You gotta do a better job keeping up with the other aspects of the new canon if you want to state such a thing so matter-of-factly. Kylo Ren (\u201cBen Solo\u201d) is 10 years older than Rey, as established in the new canonical novels. He was raised under the pretense he was an Organa-Solo, as Luke/Han/Leia were keeping Leia\u2019s true parentage a secret. Ben Solo finds out the truth when he is about 10 or 11 years old, which is when Leia sends him to be trained as a Jedi by Luke\u2026.aside from the logistical difficulties of inserting an entire romantic-relationship arc for Luke into the story, this romantic involvement would also have to take place at a time that still-dedicated Jedi (and therefore celibate and devoid of attachment) Luke was busy refounding the Jedi Order and training his 10 year old nephew in the Force\u2026.at this point it seems incredibly unlikely that Rey is a Skywalker or a Solo. As for Luke\u2019s last line in the trailer \u201c It\u2019s time for the Jedi to end\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athis corroborates another speculation that has been well-alluded to throughout the new canon: that after failing with his New Order, Luke sought out the first Jedi temple and has been busy trying to uncover the secrets of the Jedi Order\u2019s origins and past. What he has discovered is how the Order \u201clost its way\u201d or \u201cfailed in its original purpose\u201d over the course of the milennia, including becoming too dogmatic. This is why he says that line. It\u2019s also why in the trailer he asks Rey \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d and she says \u201clight\u2026darkness..the balance\u201d\u2026this concept of the \u201cbalance\u201d or the \u201cgrey Force\u201d has been alluded to throughout the new canon and is how Luke will train Rey in the Force. Luke will train Rey in a wider perspective of the Force that is in more accordance with its origins than the dogmatic interpretation of the later Jedi Order.
