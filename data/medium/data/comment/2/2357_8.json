The key for me is making peace with what I\u2019m NOT going to spend time on. I\u2019d highly recommend the book \u201cEssentialism\u201d by Greg McKeown\u200a\u2014 it\u2019s one of the few books that I can honestly say has changed my behavior and the way I think about things. A key phrase that has stuck with me is the need to separate the \u201cvital few\u201d from the \u201ctrivial many.\u201d I find myself saying \u201cyes\u201d to lots of things. This gets me into trouble because I overextend myself and then find that my efforts are diluted. Then I\u2019m bound to disappoint some of the people I\u2019ve said \u201cyes\u201d to\u2026 It\u2019s a very easy trap to fall into. I\u2019ve discovered some ways to say \u201cno\u201d to things, AND still be helpful. The book helped me quite a bit with that. Still, it\u2019s hard.
