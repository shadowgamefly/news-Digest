I was in charge of onboarding new corp managers, train the trainer and manager training that included\u200a\u2014 please don\u2019t laugh\u200a\u2014 trust circles and orienteering. I SAID DONT LAUGH!!! It was all pretty horrible from my side of the room looking at the eager and scared young faces looking back at me. I mostly coped by drawing Venn diagrams and those four grid things with cost and return quandrants\u2026. mostly just to get high off the markers\u2026. and wonder why nobody ever ate the damn doughnuts and bagels my secretary (I\u2019m old, they were secretaries back then) had to get at 5am from some bakery cross town the CEO liked and we had to patronize. Then they came out with fruit smelling markers. That\u2019s when I knew I had to get out. The coffee never got me high enough to do that for 10 hours straight.
