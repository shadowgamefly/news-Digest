During my University years I was math and physics tutor and was frustrated with my students! They were after facts, short term knowledge and \u201chow to game the system\u201d type of instructions. I however, tried to teach them the \u201cwhy\u201d never the \u201chow\u201d. This is based on my own story as a student. I was always considered a \u201cfast thinker\u201d but during exams I always showed only slightly-above-average-results. I was frustrated with the way these exams were put together, favouring memorizing data instead of understanding, computing and restructuring data. So by every student I taught I pushed more towards a world where true intelligence and true potential are getting valued. For me it was/is clear that this is the only way we can continuously bring value to this world. Let me explain. True potential, true intelligence is reflected by the ability of \u201ccomputational power\u201d. i.e. How fast are you able to cut through the noise, how far can you see through the noise, how strong can you correlate and how fast can you create meaningful value out of the data in front of you. Memorization has nothing to do with this and will not bring any value to society, since memorization only brings up the old and is not able to create the new.
