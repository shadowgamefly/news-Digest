After launching in Arizona two years ago, we are now rolling out with the largest hospital group in Arizona, and have been approved with another. I am pitching our company in a public competition this Friday, I had allotted time to work on this presentation. Real work has got in the way. An 83 year old woman called our phone number today, my turn to answer company calls. Martha, age 83, looking for assisted living- on a limited social security budget needed to be heard, she needed solutions. I knew who to connect her to, to help her. (This could be your Mom, Dad or Grandmother or Father\u200a\u2014\u200aor will be) Choice\u200a\u2014\u200ahelp an 83 year old women, or work on my pitch? I chose to help Martha, am I a bad CEO? Martha told me today that I was the nicest person she had talked to looking for assistance in finding assisted living. Everyone should want to help older people, we are all going to be there one day. I feel so focused, but I have to be there for my customers. There are just not enough hours in the day. ", "title": "", "name": "2403_9", "parent": "2403"}
