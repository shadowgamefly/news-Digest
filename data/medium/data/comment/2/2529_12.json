Future HF can change the weight allocation to anything desired and the discussed numbers here are also incorrect. \u201c They tried some strange parameter settings to force users to cut down complexity of Bitcoin transactions.\u201d So you have no idea what UTXO bloat is and why segwit is weighted thus? \u201c against the will of the community.\u201d The community overwhelmingly supports segwit and core over BU= Bitcoin Node SoftwareEdit descriptionluke.dashjr.org Coin DanceSee which active proposals are supported by which companies and find out the legal & political status of bitcoin\u2026coin.dance \u201c Bitcoin is in urgent need of diversified dev teams and implementations to achieve decentralization in Bitcoin development.\u201d There already exists over 13 implementations, each with different dev teams\u00a0, how many do you want? \u201c Should SegWit be activated, Bitcoin will have no choice but to proceed with Core\u2019s current roadmap in the coming years\u201d False, segwit doesn\u2019t force the bitcoin community to follow their roadmap whatsoever.
