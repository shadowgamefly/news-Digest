He just nailed the \u201cjazz opus\u201d which, when nailed is my favourite flavour of hip-hop. That being said, the \u201cathletic\u201d rapping here is undeniable. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this one is what he ends up looking back on as the album\u2019s he found is voice and everything was firing. Time will tell how I feel about it in the long run, but right now it\u2019s just awesome. Kendrick is untouchable. ", "username": "JustinVirly", "parent": "2226"}
