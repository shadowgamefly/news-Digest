{"parent": "2455", "content": "Ironically, I think a lot of people mistook Serrano\u2019s article as a shot at Kendrick. This article struck me as a parody of music bloggers and listeners (like me) who hyper-theorize about Kendrick subliminals. That being said, it\u2019s not hyper-theorizing to point out that Kendrick has impressively intricate writing, subliminals, and references in his work. It\u2019s amazing that one of Kendrick\u2019s biggest singles is a critique of alcohol abuse which is so well-disguised as a party anthem that it gets airplay at college parties today. This man Kendrick even wrote a sympathetic first-person narrative from the perspective of a real person who reacted to another sympathetic narrative he wrote about one of their loved ones on a previous album. It\u2019s not hyper-theorizing to say that Kendrick and TDE are excellent at subverting expectations on record and online. That\u2019s why we love them so much. On the other hand, it is hyper-theorizing to make long videos and articles parsing out subliminals about disses and album releases that probably aren\u2019t there. The second album theory was plausible (I was speculating about it myself), but it went hilariously overboard. Even the subreddit r/KendrickLamar, which mostly started the \u201csecond album\u201d rumors, has been humbly (no pun intended) laughing at itself today. With this article, Serrano is clowning some of the bloggers who write about Kendrick, not Kendrick himself. But as far as conspiracy theories go, these are pretty harmless. In the end, it\u2019s fun to be kept guessing by Kendrick and TDE.
