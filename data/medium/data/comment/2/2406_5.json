I worrh though that people are constantly inundated with the jargon\u200a\u2014\u200aMachine Learning/Deep Learning/AI and misunderstand the differences and similarities. The real danger though is that people get jaded with the terms and assume this is another \u201cBig Data\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aterminology that everyone uses because it\u2019s en vogue without understanding what this means. The real point behind Mark C\u2019s view is that machine learning isn\u2019t just another trend\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s an absolutely fundamental shift in how computing will revolutionise our lives and industry. It is as big a paradigm shift as mobile was and is the ultimate game-changer. So it\u2019s not just about learning about machine learning\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s about understanding that huge axis-tilt in computing and how that impacts us all. Thanks for sharing this with us Mark Suster\u200a\u2014\u200aabsolutely fascinating! ", "title": "", "name": "2406_5", "parent": "2406"}
