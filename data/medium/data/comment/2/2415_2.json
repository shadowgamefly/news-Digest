I haven\u2019t been formally diagnosed with ADHD but have the symptoms of multi-tasking, procrastinating, and being easily distracted, which as you know makes things challenging growing up. As a recent college graduate and a worker in the tech industry, I have been able to be more effective with your tips of diet/sleep/exercise. I took your recommendation and read Driven to Distraction as well. I have also found TM(transcendental meditation) and taking truBrain(a health startup out of Santa Monica) particularly effective. Once again thanks, really enjoying your content. ", "title": "", "name": "2415_2", "parent": "2415"}
