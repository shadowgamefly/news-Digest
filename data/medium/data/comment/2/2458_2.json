{"parent": "2458", "content": "As a happy owner of iPad Pro and unhappy owner of Macbook Pro I have lots to disagree with you. MacOS is a dying archaic horrible mess, that has couple of great features and runs the closed ecosystem of your other devices. The hardware is alright, even though the last introduction was a misstep. Apple\u2019s tablet iOS is much more refined idea of a simplified computer. I grab it and do one thing\u200a\u2014\u200aread, draw, make music it feel great as a creative tool. Desired experience between the two is vastly different. With Macbook I feel like I can work and build complex new products. With iPad I feel like relaxing and creating (mind you creating is mostly work as well). One feels big and untamed, the other feels the opposite. It has little to do with interfacing, rather the complexity of the full experience that is easy to comprehend.
