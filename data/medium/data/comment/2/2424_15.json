This is something that is not being looked at currently on most of the cooked meals/preparations. A very helpful parameter to make a decision for a truly healthful living. Not sure how a combination of foods can react when preparing a meal, to yield best alkalinity level? And whether same could be computed by a hardware solution. Ofcourse with all data gathering on each food type and chemical combination of their basic molecular structure and with available data power, we should be able to reach this interesting and important milestone too.
