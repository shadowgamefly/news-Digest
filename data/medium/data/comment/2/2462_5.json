{"parent": "2462", "content": "Yes, well\u00a0\u2026 I live in the southern hemisphere\u200a\u2014\u200aand grew up with the Mercator Projection in every atlas I ever looked at\u200a\u2014\u200athe image of a huge Greenland dwarfing my own continent of Australia\u200a\u2014\u200a(while in reality not even one-third the size of Australia) and of a vast and overarching Asia with an Africa in turn dwarfed by that distorted image of Asia. You show an interesting version of the Mercator Projection which I never ever saw\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact this is the first time to see it. What\u2019s interesting is that it shows Antarctica. The Mercator always finished below Australia in the Southern Ocean showing nothing of that region\u200a\u2014\u200aor at the very least maybe a hint\u200a\u2014\u200abelow South America\u2019s southern tip. So in the early 1980s when I first became aware of the Peter\u2019s Projection (I never saw the name Gall- attached) I bought some copies and attached them to my classroom walls and used them well (I thought) to explain to my secondary school students the flaws and distortions of the Mercator (sans Antarctica) adding a sense of enhanced size and therefore dominance to certain northern hemisphere continents and parts\u200a\u2014\u200awhile diminishing the physical size in relation to the other parts of others\u200a\u2014\u200aour own southern regions\u200a\u2014\u200asouthern Africa and Southern South America, too, included. To reduce the African continent appears to explain to me why many people/commentators reduce references to the continent to simply that name\u200a\u2014\u200aAfrica\u200a\u2014\u200aignoring the many many countries and cultures and landscapes and climatic zones which make it up. I taught nearly two decades in Japan, too, and in my university classroom I had that map on the wall. Interestingly\u200a\u2014\u200athe Japanese did not use the Mercator Projection\u200a\u2014\u200athey used another projection which unfolded as a kind of Globe version stretched straight\u200a\u2014\u200anot too far wide of the mark in terms of real comparison of size\u200a\u2014\u200aso it seemed to me that my students there were not so much in need of the corrective as in much of the rest of \u201cthe West\u201d! Don\u2019t defend the Mercator\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept in its earliest historical manifestation\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it is long past its used-by date nowadays.
