I first recognized this \u201cbad\u201d feeling I had about sexual assault in books and movies when I watched \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d I realized I was waiting for the brilliant black woman surrounded by white men to be sexually assaulted; I was bracing for the impact of that scene. But that moment never came. And thia was incredibly refreshing\u2026 which made me wonder why I expected there would be sexual violence in the first place. Thank you for the excellent book review/social commentary Deirdre Coyle!
