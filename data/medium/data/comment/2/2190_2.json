I\u2019m sure that a bot that sold at the right time when Trump mentioned companies negatively in his tweets would\u2019ve made a lot of money, but will that continue to be the case? I\u2019m skeptical that continued mentions of companies will yield the same results, particularly since Trump hasn\u2019t done it lately (Perhaps someone told him that it\u2019s irresponsible given the economic impact?). Of course, if Trump returns to the practice, his tweets may cease to have much of an impact on the stock market if he tweets company names en masse or if there prove to be few real consequences for the companies that he tweets about.
