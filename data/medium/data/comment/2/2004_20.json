I think this is a very good read. It is true that his statements are anecdotal but they are logical. I like that he makes a prediction in Watson. He is putting himself out there and making a call based on criteria which he explains. In this way he is not a psychic but an educated prognosticator. Lombardi has relationships with titans of the game. When a person can reference conversations with Parcells, Walsh and Belichick I am impressed. Lombardi spent time with those guys and he has worked in the business at many different levels. Lombardi is a boon to The Ringer. ", "username": "baumjs", "parent": "2004"}
