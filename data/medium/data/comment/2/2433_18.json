This was a great post. It seems today that young, talented founders are too often seduced by the idea of being the next \u201crockstar\u201d CEO. Perhaps it\u2019s the Zuckerberg effect combined with the ease in which you can publish content and get followers in today\u2019s social media driven society. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I see posts, articles and tweets by Millennial founders who\u2019s companies have not shipped a product, have never been profitable or are perpetually in pre-revenue stage. Your advice to Meredith should be heeded by all founders: the amount of press you have gotten or Twitter followers you have means shit. Ship a working product, produce results and focus on building a business that will not require future rounds of financing. Do that, and you\u2019ll deserve the trophy.
