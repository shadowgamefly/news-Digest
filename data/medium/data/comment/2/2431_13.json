I\u2019ve been the victim of this and it\u2019s a slippery slope. If the person introducing you is a solid connection you don\u2019t want to miss a potentially beneficial introduction or run the risk of offending them but there is only so much time and attention one can dedicate to connecting. I am a big believer in open communication and guiding how and when to have someone introduce me. If the person says I have 3\u20135 people they\u2019d like to connect me to I\u2019ll suggest that prudent first step for me would be making 1\u20132 connections first and then allow me to come back to them to report how those initial connections went. This slight throttling back of their eagerness helps me take an active role in the process and reinforces the connection by providing a recap summary of how those initial connections went. This feedback loop becomes a pivotal step to bringing the introduction process full circle and guiding the introducer as to whether their initial introductions proved productive for both parties and if further introductions make sense.
