I have noticed when using the v14 preference library that if I add icons to each of the preferences using the android:icon attribute, the divider line between preferences doesn\u2019t indent. Instead it still spans the across the whole screen. I was expecting the divider line to indent so that it lines up with the start of the preference text above it. This the behavior I see when not using PreferenceFragmentCompat (and also on my phone running Android 5.1.1). Is this a bug in the compat library? If so, are you aware of a workaround for it (preferably in XML)? Thanks. ", "username": "davidkbannister", "parent": "2152"}
