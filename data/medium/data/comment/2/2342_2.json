You don\u2019t have to be intelligent, you just need your guts and hard work to propel you forward and achieve any dream. However, I do have some suggestions for this guideline: You don\u2019t have be intelligent, that\u2019s true, but you do have to recognize your weaknesses and hone in on those areas. Perfecting your imperfections will help you reach a higher level.Don\u2019t dive right away into work, and do NOT work too hard. Take it easy. One slice at a time is easier to digest than a whole load all at once.Limit all distractions.Take breaks. Your brain needs refreshing to work well.Review what you\u2019ve accomplished by the end of each week.Think about how you can improve.Set goals for improvement.Allow yourself to be rewarded for every success that you accomplish, big or small.Have fun, and don\u2019t force yourself to do work that you don\u2019t like. I hope these will help! ", "username": "nickichiaramoore1976", "parent": "2342"}
