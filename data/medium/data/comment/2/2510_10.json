Anyhow, just trying to get a good react demo app with simple ethereum integration. Not saying it\u2019s anywhere near \u201cshareable\u201d yet, but it\u2019s: create-react-app --scripts-version ethereum-react would love some feedback\u2026. but maybe wait till the end of the weekend until I can actually go through your walkthrough cause I\u2019ll probably find some solutions in there\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "id": "979e66cd791", "name": "2510_10", "username": "johndstorey", "timestamp": 1492142954300, "creatorid": "bd20227b5554", "child": ""}
