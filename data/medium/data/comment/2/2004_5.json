It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never heard anyone say. McNabb had flaws, as a player and a teammate, but his work ethic being called into question seems insane. This is a man who once worked out so hard during an offseason that he negatively effected his arm motion because his biceps where too large. He literally worked out too much in response to getting hurt. I keep trying to like Lombardi, but I just grow more and more baffled why he keeps getting more and more time from Simmons Co.
