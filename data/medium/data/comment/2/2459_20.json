{"parent": "2459", "content": "At least DFW does an excellent job at being self-aware. There are only a few poignant remarks in the whole essay, and every single one you admit reluctantly. Have you ever considered that men recommend DFW to you because of your interest in literature, and as you eventually allow to be pried out of your tightly pursed feminist lips, he is a genius and incredibly intelligent writer? You claim to understand your bias against him\u00a0and\u00a0men\u00a0in\u00a0general, spend a couple paragraphs talking about how bad it feels to have a man make commentary on the life of a woman. You get so close to being intellectual. You could use this insight to open your mind. Alas, this essay reveals that you couldn\u2019t care less about your bias, that you\u2019re going to continue pre-forming opinions about literature that you\u2019ve never read because of some idiotic gender-pride,\u00a0that you are\u00a0not\u00a0interested\u00a0in\u00a0having\u00a0a\u00a0truly\u00a0academic\u00a0discussion. Good luck. ", "title": "", "id": "6bdcc8036640", "name": "2459_20", "username": "esmbaseball", "timestamp": 1492541897308, "creatorid": "3f55c61406e7", "child": ""}
