Are you suggesting that we conducted industrial espionage to plagiarise one specific legal document which has no direct relevance to our value proposition, in order to beat you to the punch on open sourcing it? That would be a kinda weird thing to do. Not sure how we could hope to benefit from doing that. As it says in the article, the baseline document is YCombinator\u2019s \u2018Discount, no Cap\u2019 SAFE. Everything else was done with Ignition Law, in London based on an MOU drafted in early 2016. I\u2019ll happily walk you through the paper trail if you like. Feel free to reach out: Jack at Colony.io.
