Why deface someone\u2019s art for the sake of gimmicks? I understand you have a job, or maybe this was for entertainment purposes, but you\u2019re compensating for lack of what? Kendrick delivered an album full of content, and your focus is on these illegitimate theories throughout the weekend? Maybe I don\u2019t understand journalism, but then again, after reading The A. V. Club article on Damn. it seems to me this is overreaching and pandering, just not sure who it\u2019s pandering to. I don\u2019t mean to disrespect or disregard your article, but this click bait strategy put me in a bad mood. Some people, including myself, had a cathartic experience listening to this album, and then you mock it. That\u2019s wrong.
