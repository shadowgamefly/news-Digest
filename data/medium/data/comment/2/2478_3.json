{"parent": "2478", "content": "I have no idea what that UN quote is based on, but in the scientific community the number for Ag and land use is well known and about 24\u201325%, total, if you include both direct agricultural emissions (and emissions from CH4 and N2O), and indirect (mostly deforestation). Emissions from food transport, energy used in agriculture, making fertilizers, etc., are pretty small\u200a\u2014 maybe another 1\u20133%. So, on the whole, food production emits about 1/4 of our total GHG emissions\u200a\u2014 mostly from deforestation, methane from cattle and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from fertilizer overuse. Food transport, energy use, etc., is tiny compared to these others. The best references for this are the latest IPCC reports. These are actually written by the world\u2019s leading scientists and exhaustively peer reviewed.
