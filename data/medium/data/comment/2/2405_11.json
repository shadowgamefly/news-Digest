As a CEO I find myself asking my team and my board if we\u2019re doing the right thing whilst being absolutely convinced we are. Every opportunity, every piece of PR, every speaking opporunity we ask ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200awhat is the end goal? What are we trying to achieve and how does this help us on our way? Why is it a stepping stone to our goal? In my world a conference is where you go to a) meet customer b) learn. Deals have got to be the right deals that move the business forward; customers have got to be the right customers. I think the hardest thing is not reacting to competitors\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cOh shit\u201d moments happen and you need the self-belief in the vision and the team to ensure you constantly stay true to that goal and not load what the competition do disrupt that journey; unless of course it\u2019s a truly disruptive event when non-action becomes a problem. To bastardise one of my favourite posts of yours\u200a\u2014\u200aif you know where you are you know what goal is you follow the line and don\u2019t get distracted by the dots!
