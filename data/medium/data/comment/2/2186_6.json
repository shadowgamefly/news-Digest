Our linked-In network is often comprised of very different people than we\u2019re Facebook friends with. There\u2019s a reason for that and a motive to keep it that way. Often, we don\u2019t even use our full, real names on Facebook to further prevent our professional network from stumbling on a personal profile. If Facebook tried to compete with LinkedIn by offering the same features, I absolutely would not use them and I know a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t either. In that sense, there\u2019s no real competition there, only a question of whether Facebook wants to buy them out and hold onto both as separate and distinct entities.
