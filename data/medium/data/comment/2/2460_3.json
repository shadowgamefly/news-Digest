{"parent": "2460", "content": "Great article. I have been watching David Attenborough\u2019s Natural Curiosities on Netflix (which is fantastic) and obviously Charles Darwin is mentioned a ton. I find it super interesting how many non-scientists studied new species of animals back in the 1800s. There are many cases where travelers would watch, sketch and investigate animal behavior and report their findings. Both scientists and non-scientists had theories of why certain animals looked the way they did but Charles Darwin changed everything with \u201cThe Origin of Species\u201d in 1859. Darwin faced a multitude of skeptics (including peers) but I find it fascinating that he would study findings from amateurs as well. I believe that he read every single piece of \u201cfan mail\u201d he received (including the bad stuff). Pretty remarkable that he could remain focused on his work and cut through the noise. I would love to see a profile on Darwin in the future Chad! Keep up the amazing work.
