It teaches us valuable lessons. Sports is not merely about winning, it is also about bonding and camaraderie, especially in team sports. Like in life, in sports also, there are no permanent winners or losers. Learning to lose in a dignified manner is one of the greatest lessons that sports can teach us. Losing is not a disgrace, but giving up without a fight is. We like to use the battle metaphor when two prominent sports teams clash. This is mainly to goad each sportsperson to give out his best. At the end of the \u2018battle\u2019, it is the human spirit that would have triumphed. ", "username": "mukundarajanvn", "parent": "2085"}
