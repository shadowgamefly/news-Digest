We all know about the Force and the \u201cDark Side\u201d, but speaking to balance it sounds like there is an acknowledgment that both sides are required/essential, as opposed to the usual narrative that the dark side needs to be destroyed and eliminated. Could also connect to Luke\u2019s comment about the Jedi needing to end. Should be interesting! ", "username": "brett_fish", "parent": "2227"}
