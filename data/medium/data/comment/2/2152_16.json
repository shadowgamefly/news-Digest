I think (but I\u2019m not sure) the dividers were created somewhere deep inside the code of the preferences RecyclerView. And if you want to change this, it will be a lot of work. Perhaps you can manage to hide the dividers with a style attribute which I\u2019ve missed (You can find a list of all possible attributes here) and to add your own divider as a drawable for the RelativeLayout inside the preference item layout (here). Sorry that I can not help you more. It would be great if you contact me when you find a solution. Thanks. ", "username": "JakobUlbrich", "parent": "2152"}
