Now, if you have users or show any sign of growth whatsoever, investors will throw money at you. This is all because of FOMO. People don\u2019t want to lose out on billion dollar unicorns. This is partly why Yo was able to raise $1.5 MM at a $10MM valuation. With all of this wealth being generated, people are paying attention and more startups are being founded even if not all of them are suited for it. People who are just in it for the money will often pursue plausible ideas, ideas that sound good enough and could actually work but in practice fail miserably. This starts a cycle where: shit ideas come inthey get fundingothers see this and bring shit ideas of their own The good news is that it isn\u2019t like this for every startup. Most founders are actually trying to solve problems and make the world a better place. And to be clear, I can\u2019t even blame the founders of Yo and call their idea shit because it wasn\u2019t meant to be a startup anyways. They only got venture funding once the app became popular, otherwise it was just a side project. ", "username": "ghiliweld", "parent": "2355"}
