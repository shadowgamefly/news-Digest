I am moderately introverted, and my best friend, B, is highly extroverted. B constantly asks me to join him in studying or exercising when we don\u2019t even study the same field nor are on the same workout regime. He simply wants someone to add stimulation to his environment. (I think our friendship is comedically interesting.) I, without a doubt, love to be alone for almost all activities. But I can easily transition into highly stimulated environments. He, on the other hand, can\u2019t seem to be alone for more than a few hours. So it seems evident that introverts have an easier time transitioning between environments than extroverts do. ", "username": "wj.ottenwalder", "parent": "2345"}
