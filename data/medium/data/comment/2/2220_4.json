After paying my quarterly\u2019s, when I got the bill for what I actually owed, it was time to go deeper in debt. The way I\u2019ve viewed it since, is my tax bill is my membership dues to the exclusive USA club. But I wonder today, if our president \u201cwho pays no taxes\u201d would leave me alone if I took care of my taxes like he does. Leadership comes from the top; and I\u2019m having a hard time justifying my support for lunacy. Our tax dollars= racism, nepotism, authoritarian, elitism, militarism, and a bunch more of ism\u2019s I can\u2019t think of right now.
