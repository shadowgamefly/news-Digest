{"parent": "2459", "content": "Thank you, thank you. thank you. Thank you for putting this dirty little secret out in the open so the young women don\u2019t have to sweat thirty years of literary interaction to learn the truth. That\u2019s how long it took me to figure this stuff out. Now I know why I don\u2019t read Wallace or the other writers you mention, or plenty of other \u201cmust\u201d male authors recommended to me. It\u2019s that stink those authors and their admirers exude, that faint whisper of \u201cyou\u2019ll be soooorrreeeee,\u201d that hunch that you\u2019ll spend another wasted night pursuing well-written mysogyny and self-aggrandizement. When I was young I went along because I wanted people to think I was more textbook-intellectual than I was. Didn\u2019t work. When I got older and a man decided to improve my mind, I gave them the good old \u201cIt\u2019s in my stack,\u201d though I knew I\u2019d read every women\u2019s history, medieval history, military history, medieval mystery, Victorian mystery, fantasy, science fiction, comic book, middle grade or young adult novel in my stack, including those I would be adding after that moment, before I read the raw mind-improving literary book by some man. Now, though, I\u2019m getting older, and instead I just leave my would-be improver with shreds of his face dangling from his scalp while he tried to mumble the \u201cB\u201d word through his gouged lips. A person can only take so much improvement at the hands of the man-gods of the world before she gets a little testy. Better that writers like you spare the young ones the accumulation of realization and fury before you end up trying to get the blood out of your favorite cocktail dress.
