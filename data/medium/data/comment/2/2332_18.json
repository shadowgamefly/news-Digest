Reducing contrast is not just a vacuous, slavish following of design fashion. By varying the contrast of typographical elements the designer is attempting to control visual emphasis and rhythm in order to aid the user\u2019s eye in more easily locating the important elements on the page. A page where all of the typographic elements are equally high contrast is extremely shouty and leaves the user searching a visual soup lacking visual hierarchy. I agree that it is often taken too far and that minimum contrast guidelines need to be respected. However, there is actually a baby lurking in the bath water of this particular design trend that we should take care not to just throw out. ", "username": "atomless", "parent": "2332"}
