{"content": "I enjoyed reading this article. Increasing diversity in the sector starts with attracting diversity. I have seen recently many improvements regarding that, like more transgender/female talkers on conferences for example. The coding community is putting more and more effort in its reputation and helping people to ease into it. Kyle Simpson (https://github.com/getify) is doing a great job at advocating this. Interesting to note that he said, diversity starts with inclusion. Starting to code is the first individual challenge, the second challenge will be for the industry itself. Meaning, all people involved in recruiting tech people. With this hype of \u2018super star programmers\u2019 nowadays, I do feel that \u2018late-starters\u2019 might hit some walls, here and there. My advice is for those \u2018late-starters\u2019 to improve your chances, ease into it like Chuck did. See how you can combine coding with your everyday job or hobby. Start working on these projects, share your code if plausible. Many recruiters love to ask \u201ccan we see some code of you?\u201d. Through that network many interesting opportunities will arise. I hope some other readers might append some other tips regarding this.
