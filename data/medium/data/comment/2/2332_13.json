Everything is type, every button, every item that we respond to. So it\u2019s even more annoying that designers reduce contrast not only by picking the wrong colours, but also by choosing the thinnest type possible. I\u2019ve been fighting against both trends for a long time. In most cases it is a folly of youth. Young, inexperienced designers want things to look cool. They don\u2019t use whatever site they design, they just look at it on a hi-res monitor at 400%. The font on Medium could also do with a bit more heft, but then the pages wouldn\u2019t look so precious. The type on my own site (which hasn\u2019t been updated for years) isn\u2019t light grey, but the background is. This reduces contrast and introduces white as a colour, not just a background. I\u2019ve had designers call me on this, telling me how old-fashioned it looks. But my aim is not to be cool or appear younger than I am (70 next year) but to make reading easy. After 500 years of designing books, we do know what works. Just because screens aren\u2019t made of paper doesn\u2019t mean we couldn\u2019t learn from the old guys. My letterpress studio in Berlin (www.p98a.com) is going back to printing books on old presses, using digitally generated plates (computer-to-plate: polymer without the negative film stage in between). So we get the best of both worlds: digital typography with all its choices and analog printing with real inks on real paper. Not nostalgia, but a boon to readers. My hope is that these young designers will grow out of their narcissistic phase and into responsible people who care more about their clients than their peers. Mind you, they\u2019ll have to learn their craft first. ", "username": "espiekermann", "parent": "2332"}
