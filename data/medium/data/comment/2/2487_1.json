I hope Rauner democrats living in Chicago\u2019s tony north shore suburbs along Lake Michigan are happy now. Not only is there not federal oversight of the great lakes, but little to no state oversight. Indiana\u2019s IDEM doesn\u2019t care about Chicago\u2019s drinking water. This is what you get when you switch parties because a hedge fund manager seemed fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I\u2019m sure Jennifer Pritzker doesn\u2019t care much about the environment. On the plus side, Rauner gave some money to NRDC. So do other seemingly cool republicans in Chicago. Maybe they\u2019ll put up the money to reverse the Chicago river to keep the Asian carp out. And help BP with its air and water pollution control systems at the Whiting refinery. The lion\u2019s share of tar sands that are flowing down from Canada go to Chicago refineries. Refining that goo requires tighter controls. Controls that won\u2019t get upgraded due to Trump, Pruitt and now Rauner.
