First, the \u201cbut\u2026but\u2026but\u2026HILLARY!\u201d routine, or some variation thereof. Second, the \u201cDemocrats (or the media) are still mad about my landslide victory\u201d song and dance number (I\u2019m not even going to get into what a lie that is). Both routines have gotten stale, but they\u2019re all he has. His early morning tweets are just this sort of fluff. The main thing we need to remember is when you watch an illusionist, don\u2019t get mesmerized by the hand that\u2019s waving about flamboyantly. Keep an eye on the hand in the pocket. And when Trump starts throwing out a lot of distractions, it\u2019s time to pay attention to his hand in his pocket. ", "username": "victorialambhatch", "parent": "2189"}
