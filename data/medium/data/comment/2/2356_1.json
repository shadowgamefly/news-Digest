It\u2019s crazy to think that I was watching 3\u20134 hours of TV, just on a weeknight! I don\u2019t even remember how much was spent during the weekend. I got to the point that I pretty much watched everything good that was on Netflix, including some shows that aren\u2019t even on there (ie. GoT). It felt so pathetic. I figured, reading was even more enjoyable. It was a harder task maybe, but not only did I enjoy reading, but it was a productive use of time. I wasn\u2019t just letting my brain melt in make believe garbage meant to hook me in. I could read a book that could change my life. I ended up reading 25+ books last year, while still watching a few seasons of shows throughout the year! Couple months ago, I decided to tackle my social media and phone addiction. I observed that I spent an hour or more a day on my phone on social media only. So I deleted it. That\u2019s 7 extra hours a week that is spent productively. I think tackling the few big time suckers, such as TV, social media, traffic are fantastic places to start auditing, and replacing. If not for anything, spend it reading, it\u2019s guaranteed make time more fulfilling and productive. Next step for me is to actually analyze every single moment. The thought of it seems rough\u00a0:/. Thanks Charles! Your writing is awesome! ", "username": "marcuswong", "parent": "2356"}
