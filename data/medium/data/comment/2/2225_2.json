The difference however as to the impact and importance of the message is the authenticity of the messenger. When Chance worships, hands high, head raised, voice singing out you feel the joy of his genuine faith and celebration. When Kendrick sits in a dimly lit room and ponders the depth and complexity of existence and is lead time and again to God you resonate with his struggle. However, when these other rappers hear K-Dot & Chance living out their faith in verse, they simply decide they gotta get some of that for their tracks too, then like Portlandia\u2019s Bryce Shivers & Lisa Eversman, \u201cPut a bird on it!\u201d Good on ya Chance & Kendrick! As to the rest, enjoy putting a bird on it. ", "username": "mfterich", "parent": "2225"}
