Now here at 12:35am the next day, I\u2019ve decided I should, or else I\u2019m not going to stop thinking about this. Plus I have nothing to lose. And at a minimum it may be strangely fulfilling to know someone ponders your writing to such a degree. Why did you choose to use the word \u201cFuck\u201d here? Who is your target audience? You state in your piece you don\u2019t want to worry about such things, but you HAVE to have someone in mind when you write who you\u2019re speaking to. Otherwise that makes you crazy. As an English major and all-too-often editor, I can appreciate some well-placed cussin\u2019. Like Bart Simpson, I also learned cursive. But this seemed awkward and sort of adolescent, considering what you do for a living and who probably reads your stuff, like me. I mean what I\u2019m sure sounds like a knock with all due respect, in that I respect your writing. I follow you here on Medium and there on social media, so I\u2019m familiar with your style. It\u2019s use obviously is deliberate and to have an intended effect, but it ends up being sort of offensive to your reader. Or, I guess, at least me. I was hoping you might explain, and if not, at least so I can finally get that off my chest. ", "title": "", "name": "2435_10", "parent": "2435"}
