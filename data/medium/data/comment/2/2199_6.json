Both times I deleted it because I felt like people were there only for bullying, they don\u2019t really enjoy the content, or follow to learn something. They are mostly males who are trying to hit on someone, so Periscope is definitely a no-no for me !", "username": "opulencedaze", "parent": "2199"}
