Working for large multinational or large domestic corporates is expected derigeur & the prevailing social norm. Systemicaly and socially failure is not an option like it is in CA & or the US. Startup founders have to withstand intense domestic pressure in Asian cultures than many American founders which brings in added stress. While each country culture is also subtly different in its entrepreneurial zeal and capability the also suffer from additional constraints. Education is a rote learning hierarchical top down experience and most Asian founders have to unlearn and overcome this historical burden. It is only in the last 3\u20134 years that countries, financial institutions and investors have discovered startups. Individual Investors bring old school metrics and performance parameters while wanting to participate. This is the latest strut of the dancing & preening peacocks in social situations. Sadly while they are flaunting their supposed investment savvy they can also burden Asian founders with unfathomable advice, unsustainable performance yardsticks and financial handcuffs. Asian founders need to have immense tenacity & sagacity to build companies in their home countries and one respects their will to overcome significantly higher odds than elsewhere.
