I wouldn\u2019t be convinced that I am wrong about my choices based in crowd\u2019s believes. If the crowd is quick to label people, then I know for sure that their opinions are based on other assumptions. But, if a crowd tried to move against me systematically from the very first day, them maybe I would feel really bad, that would be enough to behave erratically and fearful.
