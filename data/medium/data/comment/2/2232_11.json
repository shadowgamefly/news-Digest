Netflix is a smart platform to distribute an ultra low-budget film if possible. I can personally attest to having friends tell me of obscure movies I\u2019d never heard of that had become a popular Netflix watch. Also, a lot of would be great indie-filmmakers have taken their talents to TV and that\u2019s also I think smart. TV show budgets have definitely risen and we\u2019ve seen more talent transition into exploring that realm with great results. Not that anybody does it for this reason but it\u2019s also a more secure paycheck and it tends to keep you more relevant in the industry as there\u2019s a larger body of work to examine. I think that as the world transitions more to pay for only the services you watch, this will become an even more prominent model. ", "username": "jovanllrobinson", "parent": "2232"}
