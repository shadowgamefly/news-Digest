{"parent": "2528", "content": "Just wanted to point out a slight technical inaccuracy here in the \u201chistory\u201d part: Taiwan didn\u2019t push for \u201cnew\u201d banking reforms by promoting mergers in 2013. The current financial landscape was largely shaped during 2004\u201308 before the Global Financial Crisis. There have been many wolf cries regarding the third banking reform in the past decade but mostly were denied by the regulators. The \u201cMega Bank\u201d (official name Mega Financial Holdings) that got into the AML trouble with the NYDFS was itself the outcome of a merger in 2002\u201306. In fact, this merged entity can trace its history back to the Qing dynasty and one of its predecessors was one of the three \u201cspin-offs\u201d of the original Bank of China after the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Because of its historical position, Mega Financial is part of CHIPS and serves as the de facto clearing representative for Taiwan in the USD currency regime, a status that comes with unique privileges and extraordinary obligations. If you dig into the Cold War history a bit deeper, given Taiwan\u2019s special \u201cnon-state actor\u201d status in the Sino-US relationship, you won\u2019t be surprised by the fact that many \u201cAML/KYC\u201d incidents that are deemed illegal today can be tolerated as \u201cpatriotic\u201d in the eyes of Uncle Sam under the right geopolitical pretext.
