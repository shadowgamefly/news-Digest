You are assumed to be \u2018qualified\u2019 when you carry a set of credentials (i.e., Bachelor\u2019s degree in whatever), but we all know from experience this isn\u2019t always the case. From my point of view, this is what we\u2019re lied to about\u200a\u2014\u200athat acquiring certain credentials prepares us to complete tasks when it maybe actually doesn\u2019t. \u201cEver since you were a little kid, you were told that in order to be successful, you have to train, prepare, study, and pick up certain skills. Only once you have these skills can you take life by the horns and get ahead. Once you are qualified, only then can you get that job you dream of, land that raise, make that money, or move to that neighborhood in which you want to live. So you study hard, you specialize, you stay up late and take internships in the industry in which you work.\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t really see how this is necessarily a lie. It may not be true in all cases, but you\u2019re not exactly set up for success in, say, IT, if you\u2019ve never used a computer before in your life. Training, preparing, studying, and picking up skills are a few of the ways, if not the main ways, of improving your qualifications. ", "username": "mikeyvxt", "parent": "2101"}
