{"parent": "2461", "content": "I have tried to write a note to you Zach, but everything just comes out like a bunch of BS. Sorry. You did a wonderful job in honoring your best friend. A death that feels like it has come too soon just inspires anger in me. I rail at the person responsible. I find myself mentally locking and loading on my way to go and stop things like this from ever happening again (I am a police officer). It is all so unfair and makes us feel lame when we think about the small things like what we were doing the moment the truth arrived. And now, ten years later, no matter how many times we add the numbers, the sum still comes up to an unacceptable total. I am sorry for your loss.
