If simply holding a token means the holder shares in profits and/or losses or the project, then yes, that would be a security. Whether that is problematic with respect to US securities regulations would be consequent of whether those tokens were distributed as a result of general solicitation and are openly traded. I don\u2019t know anything about Lunyr, but in Augur you may not receive a share of fees simply by owning tokens. You receive fees as a result of using your tokens to report on the outcomes of events. If you don\u2019t report, then not only will you not receive any fees, but you may also be penalised some portion of your tokens. With this approach, to my non-lawyer eye, Augur breaks the \u2018efforts of others\u2019 prong of the Howey Test, and is therefore, not a security. EDIT: I just want to caveat this again with IANAL, so don\u2019t take anything I say as fact\u2014only opinion.
