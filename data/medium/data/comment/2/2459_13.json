{"parent": "2459", "content": "I think that a lot of men recommend DFW to women because they sincerely want to appear to be intellectuals even when they aren\u2019t. DFW\u2019s vocabulary is vast, his style is (at times) endearing and less pretentious than that of the average writer with a vocabulary like his, and, to pseudo-intellectuals, the themes, and even the words themselves, are nearly incomprehensible. This compels many men to wear their \u201clove\u201d of DFW as a sort of intellectual plumage whether they understand him or what he\u2019s trying to communicate or not. It\u2019s usually an ironic vehicle for mansplaining, too, thanks to their lack of either actually reading the works or understanding them. I enjoyed many of his short stories but couldn\u2019t really get into his novels. To be fair, my favorite novel is The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas, so the length wasn\u2019t the issue. It was the feeling of dragging along and, like you noted, the fact that there wasn\u2019t much that I really related to on a personal level that could hook me in for the long haul. I didn\u2019t care much for Catcher in the Rye either. Shhhhh don\u2019t tell the literati. Thanks for sharing your experiences and especially for reminding us that outstanding female authors don\u2019t have enough vocal proponents. My biggest takeaway from your article will be to recommend more female authors to everyone. If I must, I will do it over, and over, and over, and over, and over again until they finally read their works and report back to me. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude00 ", "title": "", "id": "802d424ba521", "name": "2459_13", "username": "Chromatonix", "timestamp": 1492548541107, "creatorid": "a6f53b5a44a2", "child": ""}
