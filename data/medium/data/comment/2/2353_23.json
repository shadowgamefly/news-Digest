As far as I can remember I was always a fan of Bruce. He was, in a lot of ways my inspiration for life. His way of thought, his cockiness and his compassion\u200a\u2014\u200ahis genius. He was an amazing man and I get that just from his writings and the books and people that spoke of him, his way of life. I started martial arts when I was very young and his teachings are still a big influence in my life. I see how he changed the world and hope that it is something I can carry on. He also pioneered fitness in a way that no one esle could, not even greats like Arnold and Frnak Zane could hold a candle to Bruce. In a lot of ways thats how I want to help people and why I\u2019m in the weight loss and fitness biz. Thanks again Charles. ", "username": "james.d.lundy", "parent": "2353"}
