{"content": "Ahhh, this brings back memories. I moved my family from Brisbane, Australia to Dallas to work for a company that were going to create the next B2B LinkedIn killer, back in 2011. Same story\u2026 grand promises, and mysteriously absent paychecks. There was a revolt and everyone just bailed, and no-one got a dime. The line about the cashier\u2019s checks being on a UPS truck actually rings so true, as I was the ONLY person in the whole office to get a final check, as the HR guy felt sorry for me and handed it over, mere hours before the boss clawed them back and said no-one was getting paid (again). \u201cThe Investors will come through, they\u2019re who we\u2019re waiting on\u201d etc\u2026 it really saddens me to think this story repeats itself so often. It\u2019s an awful feeling, especially when you leave your home to go do something big, and end up being screwed by people who really don\u2019t care that your life is being turned upside down by their dishonesty and ruthless self-preservation. Oh, and reputation management\u2026 that was one of this company\u2019s functions, and the amount of crap we were tasked with scrubbing with cheap, nasty SEO tricks and wall pages\u2026 makes me shudder. Thanks for sharing, and I\u2019m glad you were able to come out of it with a positive mindset and counting your blessings.
