The truth is, i know next to nothing about the DC comics or even action movies in general but i did see suicide squad and yawned half way through it. I agree with you on the accent and the joker was just a bit much, kinda weird too. I loved the wit from Will Smith and i agree that Viola Davis was well suited for her role. I have nothing much to compare this movie to but i think \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d come to mind a lot when i think about it. Let\u2019s hope people take your advice and spend that 1k or 1.5k only if they need to. ", "username": "bukkyshaba", "parent": "2312"}
