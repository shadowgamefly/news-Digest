{"parent": "2480", "content": "When is this idiot Romm going to give up.NASA and even the NEW YORK TIMES have stated that the atmosphere is warming due to CO2 increases. That means incoming sun heat is being absorbed by CO2 in the atmosphere, before it can reach the Earth. How is that going to make the earth warmer. If all the sun\u2019s heat gets absorbed by the atmosphere will the Erath be hotter with NO heat reaching the ground? When clouds cover the sky, doe it get hotter? Clouds are made of water vapor, water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas, so with more GHG in the atmosphere (clouds), does it get hotter? It doesn\u2019t does it? Blocking out sun heat, regardless of whether it is with CO2, or methane, or water vapor, will cool the earth not warm it. You people are really so stupid that you can\u2019t understand this? Romm is lying to make money, but what money are you making? Is it hotter when the sky is covered in clouds?
