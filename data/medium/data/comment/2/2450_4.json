How many of the present generation, convinced of their own uniqueness are aware of the French Revolution\u2019s record of idealism turned mayhem, ending in the tyrant Napoleon and a generation of war, and in the process destroying Robespierre and other veterans of the initial uprising? How many are aware of the Russian Revolution\u2019s defamation and slaughter of it\u2019s true believers by the rise of Stalin as the Revolution\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d spokesman?
