I like: \u201cBy deciding what our priority is, we\u2019re also deciding what it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s hard.\u201d, as it captures that point. To define the boundary around what is in scope, it is also helpful to identify what is out of scope. Also, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.This also relates to a central tenet of the GTD approach (\u201cGetting Things Done\u201d by David Allen) that: one can only do (consciously) one thing at a time;the only way to do one thing is to be happy that it is the right thing to be doing;the only way to be happy that it is the right thing is to know what all the other things are and to be happy not to be doing them, at that time. So it is not merely a matter of knowing the other seven of the top ten. (According to GTD, at least\u2026) one needs to know all the other things to relax with confidence that there are no timebombs or landmines anywhere. However, knowing this does not mean that I am good at doing it (so I probably don\u2019t truly know it yet!) ", "username": "JohnWLewis", "parent": "2357"}
