{"parent": "2459", "content": "Your point that women don\u2019t recommend books by female authors is an interesting one, because I often wish I would get recommendations for female authors that reached the exhortative levels I got to in my first year after reading Consider the Lobster and A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again (I\u2019ve calmed down since, especially when I realized that fervent evangelism is the worst possible way of recommending a writer known for skepticism and irony). Like, just this last year, I finally opened The Handmaid\u2019s Tale after years of telling myself I would do my cultural homework by reading this book\u200a\u2014\u200aand it was amazing! Why the hell weren\u2019t people hurling copies of this book at my head the second I expressed some enjoyment of 1984? Or take Virginia Woolf\u200a\u2014\u200aI read To The Lighthouse in college and loved it, and moved on to\u2026nothing else by her! How come people seem okay with this? How can I be able to go into society, and every third sentence I hear is not \u201cHave you started Mrs. Dalloway yet?\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a product of the different behavioral expectations society has for men and women\u200a\u2014\u200alike, the same unspoken social structures that make everyone assume that the guy should ask the girl out make guys more likely to be overbearing when recommending books, and cause women to be more likely to withhold their opinion. I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m not even sure how true this is\u200a\u2014\u200athe recommendations I can remember receiving have about a 50/50 gender split on the recommendations (though the authorship tends to skew male). All I know is, I\u2019d rather live in a world where I get regular strident, insistent recommendations for books I wouldn\u2019t otherwise consider than a world where everyone sits politely inside their own cloisters of personal taste, sheltering the world from the sight of their cultural preferences.
