This is a vital distinction because I overcame shyness but not my introversion. And yes, drinking or abusing substances can become a coping mechanism when an introvert is compelled to be in a situation that is over stimulating. Until I embraced the fact that I am an introvert and really didn\u2019t care if people misinterpreted my introversion as: aloof, snobby, uncommunicative or just a stick-in-the-mud; my social life depended on substances. I have family that are extroverts: out-going, bubbly, \u2018never met a stranger\u2019 and social butterflies. When they are surrounded by diversion and the promise of attention they bloom and thrive; by themselves\u2026? They are bored, frustrated and agitated. One of the most important lessons life has taught me is that being an introvert is not a shameful thing. Life as an introvert is just as relevant, satisfying and vital as a person that chooses to be otherwise. I certainly prefer it. ", "username": "WeekerW", "parent": "2345"}
