{"content": "The most nefarious and frustrating part of this for me\u200a\u2014\u200aa technology educator working with digitally divided folks\u200a\u2014\u200ais that tech-savvy people can often reason their way out of some of this (they can click \u201cskip ad\u201d or they can find the small text \u201cnot now\u201d instead of giving someone their phone number) and so some of it is literally preying on the less-savvy folks to do what the website or app creator wants. Sometimes this is benign and just unconsidered and sometimes it\u2019s literally a dark pattern which is intending to do this. We have a responsibility to the vulnerable people in our society and that is starting to have to extend into helping them navigate tricky online interfaces. There\u2019s a nasty streak of techno-libertarianism that basically blames these folks for their own inability to make the correct choices when confronted with a lot of these magic tricks.
