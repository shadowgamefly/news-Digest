These are all valid ways of articulating design directives. Any good directive describes the end without prescribing the means. What I love about this explanation of JTBD directives is how far upstream they go, opening up the possibility of satisfying needs in unexpected ways. Too often features get cranked out in service of business. This approach will help us design in service of people. ", "username": "nathanlucy", "parent": "2169"}
