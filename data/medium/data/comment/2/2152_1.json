There's one correction about the very last part, though. The reason why you had to add those styles is because you passed \"0\" as the defStyle in your second constructor of TimePreference. You should pass instead R.attr.dialogPreferenceStyle. That will ensure that the DialogPreference has the correct default attributes and then you can skip the \"Fixing the Layout and Design\" part. I'll keep your article for reference. ", "username": "ivansoriano", "parent": "2152"}
