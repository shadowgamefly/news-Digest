You could gain entry THE REGULAR WAY, as a Coach of the People. Turns out there\u2019s a few unintended consequences involved with presenting the FF games inside a Zeppelin museum that dwarfs Tempe Stadium. Among those? There are huge swaths of seats that are so far out from the court that a patron who tries to throw something at a ref would be exposed to dealing with three geographically contiguous yet legally distinct municipal jurisdictions. If you go to circumnavigate the concourse, be sure to have your identification documents in order because there are at least two sections where you\u2019re liable to detention by ICE agents acting under the authority of Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Looking out onto the north expossure, you can\u2019t quite make out Senator McCain\u2019s cliff-side estate in Sonora, but you can make out livestock stables on his southern ranch. What I\u2019m trying to say here is that there\u2019s lots of tickets that are going begging. The ticket hawkers are taking a real photon shower. And if this year\u2019s experience of playing in a venue larger than a constitutionally-significant number of Congressional electoral districts doesn\u2019t stop the trend, I\u2019m hearing and reading serious speculation about Grand Canyon hosting the next Az FF, and I don\u2019t mean the arena of the university of that name. They\u2019ll set up some parquet, band seating and media pods right at the bottom alongside the Colorado River parquet, bolt chairs along the trails all the way up to the plateau, some 6 hours walking distance away, and sell temporary loge seating along the crest. Capacity? Depending on how much of the perchable surface they\u2019ll have to dedicate to concession booths and restrooms, I\u2019d estimate somewhere in the low millions. As it is, the players are going to need golf course flags or windsocks for a decent chance at making three pointers, and there\u2019s going to be both a weird sonic delay like when you\u2019re talking with your aunt in Sante Fe via Skype, plus the crowd reaction from some big plays won\u2019t hit the players until the next commercial time out. Fluid replacement from rapid wind-aided evaporation will be an issue. ", "username": "labdancer", "parent": "2087"}
