I\u2019m married to a Mexican woman who didn\u2019t speak english until she was 7. Her parents were migrant workers and they went through the system legally and are now proud US citizens. They are adamant that we should have strong borders and a legal process in order to protect that which they fought so hard to be part of\u2026so this isn\u2019t a rhetorical political question for me nor them. We\u2019re a country of laws and this argument that those of us who want our strong borders and our laws enforced are radical xenophobes who want to break up families is nothing but insulting political mud-slinging. Trump is anything but eloquent in much of what he says, but it is the radical left\u2019s policies (particularly under Obama) that has given rise to his popularity. We need real conversations about these very real problems without the constant demonization of those we disagree with and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s a tone you will set. You have incredible reach and influence due to your success in life and with that comes incredible responsibility. Political bomb throwing diminishes everyone so if you\u2019re going to engage in politics along side of your incredible VC insight, I hope you realize this type of thing chips away at what is an impressive leadership role you have earned.
