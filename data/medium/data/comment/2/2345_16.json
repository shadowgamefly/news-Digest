Especially when observing how my extroverted sister struggles so much with being alone and hating to read and being divorced\u00a0. She also deals with boredom a lot more than I do\u00a0! I have a rich inner world and find it far more interesting than much of the outer world I observe on a daily basis\u00a0.I love to read\u00a0, write\u00a0, create art\u00a0, study all kinds of things and just learn in general\u00a0.My extroverted sister needs people to feel fulfilled\u00a0.
