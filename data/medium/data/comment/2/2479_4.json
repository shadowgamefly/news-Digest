Estimates discussed earlier this week at the United Nations Climate Summit put that number closer to 50%. [\u2026] The reason for the difference is that the 11%-15% estimates only take into account emissions from the farming part of agriculture, such as plowing and fertilizing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 14% estimate, for example, includes emissions from agriculture\u2019s mechanical equipment, soil management, enteric fermentation (which produces, say, belches from a cow), manure management, rice cultivation and field burning. It doesn\u2019t include transport, food processing, packaging, and sale of agricultural products. The 43%-57% estimates, which are published in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2018s 2013 Trade and Environment Review, look at food production more broadly to also include emissions from land-use change and deforestation, as well as the processing, packaging, transport and sale of agricultural products. So basically, the sum total of human food production, transport and sale may account for up to 57% of all global greenhouse has emissions.
