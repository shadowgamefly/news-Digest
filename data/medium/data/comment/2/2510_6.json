{"parent": "2510", "content": "I like Metamask a lot because a user can interact with a web app that uses Ethereum (this does not need to be, strictly speaking, a \u201cdapp\u201d). You don\u2019t \u2018sign a contract\u2019, but rather you sign a transaction with your private key before sending it to the Ethereum network. This is to ensure the transaction is coming from you and not being spoofed by some random person. A voting system could probably have a function like this: function vote(bool yes) returns (bool) {  if (votes[msg.sender]) { throw; }  votes[msg.sender] = true;  if (yes) { yes_votes += 1; }  else { no_votes += 1; }  return true;} You could probably design a better one with more time, but anyway, this would be pretty minor gas usage, probably somewhere around 75k gas (about 10 cents at median gas rates). Check this site out for more info: http://ethgasstation.info/ Of course you\u2019d have to clock the gas usage in development. Hope that helps.
