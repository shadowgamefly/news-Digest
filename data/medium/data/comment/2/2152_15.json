Sure it needs some work to set it up, but when you have done this one time, you can always copy and paste it to other projects. It also allows you to easily define your preferences in an xml file and manages the thing like storing and reading values, generating sub-screens for nested preferences. I think the work of building this stuff by your own is higher than fixing the library once. I also hope that google will fix the issues in the library one day \ud83d\ude09 ", "username": "JakobUlbrich", "parent": "2152"}
