{"parent": "2457", "content": "Nice article. Going to start a thousand arguments. My faves include Monorail, Cape Feare, and Mr. Plow. Also, Homer\u2019s Odyssey, if only for Burns\u2019 line to Homer: \u201cYou\u2019re not as stupid as you look, or sound, or our best testing indicates.\u201d Itchy and Scratchy Land should\u2019ve been higher (\u201cWhere nothing can possib-lie go wrong!\u201d) I also think Season 11\u2019s Behind the Laughter and Season 12\u2019s New Kids on the Blecch should have made the list. The latter if only for LT Smash\u2019s unnecessary secrecy surrounding his name. (To Bart: \u201cAll in due time.\u201d \u201cThe card says LT Smash.\u201d \u201cThe time has come. I\u2019m LT Smash!\u201d Lisa: \u201cLieutenant Smash!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. Lieutenant LT Smash.\u201d) Also super liminal (\u201cJoin the Navy!\u201d) and Otto\u2019s nonchalant response to being told he\u2019s being brainwashed (\u201cYeah, probly.\u201d). Behind the Laughter has so many great lines, and the Behind the Music parody is spot on (\u201cWas the dream over? Yes, yes it was. Or was it?\u201d). Also don\u2019t know how Fear of Flying was left off. (\u201cThat\u2019s OK, Marge. We\u2019ll just let the killer bees come to us.\u201d).
