The only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology is exploding small hydrogen bombs underground! And even there the effective costs and the possible damages are problematic, the saner design would use \u201cjust\u201d the less energetic fission bombs! We still don\u2019t know if the only really sustainable harvesting of fusion energy is the one which the photosynthetic eukaryotes already do all over the Earth. It seems that even the nature needed a lot to achieve that\u200a\u2014\u200athe photosynthetic cells are, as far as it\u2019s presently known, billions of years more recent than the first life on Earth. Most of the energy we use today is obtained by burning the matter the plants produced by converting the energy from the Sun. The nature needed many millions of years for that, and it seems the humanity burned a half of conventional oil reserves in just a hundred years, while using the energy abundance to increase the population over the previous carrying capacities, effectively demanding always more energy. It should be researched, but at the moment the humanity should not plan its own future on the premise that producing fusion on Earth is a sustainable solution to the energy needs.
