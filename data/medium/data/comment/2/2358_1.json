Vulnerability is a very tough choice for a leader.As leaders,the expectation is to be rock solid and boldly face all storms that are thrown at the team.The team looks at you for support both Mental and motivational. In such a situation A vulnerable leader may deflate the confidence of the team and the team might lose focus. So My take is vulnerability should be situation and maturity based.A leader should only convey his vulnerability to \u201cmature\u201d team members who can understand and at the same time,he should never appear vulnerable when a storm is imminent.
