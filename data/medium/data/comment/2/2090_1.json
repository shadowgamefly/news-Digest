I never said it was easy! And I\u2019d be lying if I entered EVERY situation with an open mind. But in the same way that I write for you and others, I write for myself. I TRY to keep an open mind at all times. It\u2019s made a huge difference. I truly and sincerely appreciate your kind compliment. It\u2019s always so nice to see kind praise. But yours really did touch and inspire me. I\u2019m truly grateful to you. And happy to know you see in me, what it took me quite a while to see in myself, but now do. Cheers!
