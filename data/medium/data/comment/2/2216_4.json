These weren\u2019t really in-depth articles, so I suppose that\u2019s one reason the rates were low. Some feature articles (picked off the assignment desk or by assignment) could pay around $5\u201320 but invariably we had to give up all rights to those stories so Yahoo could farm them out to syndicating outfits if they chose. In the end, I found it paid better to write ad libitum and gather payment solely on views. It sounds like your writing was much more research intensive than what I did, so that\u2019s probably why it paid better. I do hope Medium goes more for the in-depth, well-paid researched stuff rather than the pay by view free-for-all that Yahoo Contributor Network could be.
