I spent so many years thinking my natural talent and intelligence was enough, and that it was just bad \u201dluck\u201d that Fortune hadn\u2019t come knocking on my door. It wasn\u2019t until some point in the last five years that I realized that hard work beats talent, intellect, and your well-crafted network of professional connections nine times out of ten. I wish everyone else would learn this far earlier than I did \u2013 I see so many people coasting through life on talent and intelligence alone and then not knowing how to handle things once they reach the edge of their comfort zone. They\u2019ve just never learned to put in the hard work required. ", "username": "BrekiT", "parent": "2342"}
