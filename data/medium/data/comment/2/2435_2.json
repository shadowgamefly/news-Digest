I had personal experience with dissenters, for several years one person was making trouble in our company, personally attacking me and my decisions. It was hard to part ways because he was part of the family, at least during those times\u00a0:-) He made me question my actions a lot, which is good, but I also came to realization that this person is just weak, unable to produce anything on their own because he have constant issues with authorities, in this case me. As you said, dissenter can be a good thing, but only if they are strong and able to take responsibility. If they are weak, they only bring disturbance into work environment, nothing else. Leadership is all about taking responsibilities and risks, there are not many who are actually able to do that, and for certain it\u2019s hard to learn how to lead if you don\u2019t have it in you. I used to be a follower, until I didn\u2019t discover my urge to lead, since then there is no going back, once you are a leader, you are leader until rest of your life, and you have to live with it\u00a0:-) ", "title": "", "name": "2435_2", "parent": "2435"}
