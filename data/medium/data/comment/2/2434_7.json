Done properly, it can bring an immediate gain to the business through a useful technology or team that significantly moves the needle for the acquiring startup. In fact, if anything, an M&A deal done for mostly equity could even be looked at as a sign of strength by the acquiring startup, given their ability to convince other founders to convert equity in their own startup to equity of that in a new startup. I would agree that blindly just looking to do M&A is not ideal, but again, done in the right circumstances, it can yield fantastic results. M&A is often something that only big companies can pull off, so for a startup to pull this off at an early stage actually shows the maturity of the founders and the acquiring startup.
