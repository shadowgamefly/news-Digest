Yesterday I talked with my old friend about analyzing networks of motor cortex neurons to establish causality in some observable movements. Last week, I helped organize some other very good sounding shit (literally about curing cancer and cardiomyopathy, whether they will be cured by such activities\u00a0\u2026) Her running partner asked if I would join. I said no. I thought \u00abI am not a runner \u00ab I am not a neurobiologist, I am not a geneticist or even a computer scientist. There are no roots and there is no tree. There is no marriage, no clear career path or even country and state. Maybe I should plant some seeds. It is horrifying and exhilarating at the same time. May the headlines go to hell, I like your articles much better than \u00abthe seven ways to reach your goals before 8:15 am when the weather is rainy\u00bb or whatever those articles say.
