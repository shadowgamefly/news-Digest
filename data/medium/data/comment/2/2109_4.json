Your point about disproving initial impressions is very powerful. It can be challenging for all of us to see past initial impression and focus on merit. I also agree 100% that practical exercises, preferably ones that simulate on-the-job tasks, are the best way to assess candidates. They remove interviewer bias and give you a chance to see candidates perform in relevant scenarios. Candidates can in turn experience similar tasks to the ones they\u2019ll do in the role. It gives them a chance to see if it\u2019s really what they want so the less motivated ones should opt out. Thanks for sharing your experience and learnings.
