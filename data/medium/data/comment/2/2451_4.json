{"content": "What is interesting to me is what is considered \u2018breadwinner status\u2019. I think one woman made 11k more than her husband, and considered herself the breadwinner. But he made really good money too! I make 50k and my cohabitating boyfriend makes 85k. I make more than enough to support myself, so I never considered him the breadwinner. For some reason, that connotes a stay at home spouse situation to me, or at least one person making the vast, vast majority of the money. Am I off base? I don\u2019t know why people would split hair over this, when they both work are self-sufficient.
