Thank you so much. Makes my day. And it\u2019s been a pretty great day around here. One of the truly great things about planting seeds is that it\u2019s the ultimate permission for starting small. One small choice adjustment. One small pattern change. One small step. You completely nailed it on the \u201cheadline.\u201d I sense you know exactly what you need to know about yourself and your surroundings at this point. It\u2019s just putting one small step into play each day. That\u2019s it. I am SO saving your response, Lorenzo! And please let me know if I can ever be of help. This is the kind of engagement I spoke about in the post today. So, thank you! ", "username": "JoeJacobi", "parent": "2084"}
