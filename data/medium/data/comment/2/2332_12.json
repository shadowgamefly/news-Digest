But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. While it\u2019s hard to find a good number for the physical print contrast between \u201cblack\u201d ink and \u201cwhite\u201d paper, what I\u2019ve found suggests that for books it tends to be in the 10:1\u201315:1 range, with good hardback books being around 12:1. The WebAIM contrast checker tells us that using a text color of #333 and a background color that\u2019s backed off a little from pure white, say #F8F8F8, provides a contrast ratio of 11.9:1\u2014well above the 7:1 minimum for the WCAG AAA level, and actually, well, pretty book-like. I\u2019d submit that a lot of pages out there use \u201cdark grey on near white\u201d that look just fine, because in practice, that really isn\u2019t too light. Here\u2019s one for you, in fact: the one you\u2019re reading right now! Medium uses #FFF as its background, but sets the type to be #000 with a 0.8 alpha\u2014 which, perhaps not coincidentally, resolves to #333. It still looks black, doesn\u2019t it? The real problem, I think, is grey text on light grey backgrounds. Apple, for instance, is using #666 text on the page you linked to, which won\u2019t even hit a 6:1 contrast ratio on a pure #FFF background. Ironically, while designers keep getting blamed for this theoretical plague, I see it most on pages put together by engineers and technical groups: Apple\u2019s main web site, I notice, has much higher contrast. (And most text-heavy sites do, as well. Check the contrast ratios for the NYT, CNN, Washington Post, and so on, and you are likely to find 12:1 and higher.)
