The coaches have to answer your question or to check in on you at least once in 24 hours. So what really happens is that you send the coach a message, he or she answers you in 18\u201324 hours but almost always it falls some time next day, so it is very difficult to have a meaningful communication with coach, it like having a ping-pong game with 24 hours delay. Some coaches do not answer over the weekend so it can be few days until you hear back from the coach, for example if the coach usually answers at 10:00pm, so if you send him a message back at Thursday 10:01 pm, the coach would not answer until next Monday at 10:00pm. Basically I do not think it worth the $50 a month (or cheaper if you a coupon). Zen Habits Sea Change program seem (at least for me) more effective. While SC does not have coaching it has caring community that really can help and motivate. P.S. I used to follow Tony Stubblebine, the founder of coach.me but after he wrote glowing article and a script on how to fire people I \u201cunfollowed\u201d him. ", "username": "Guko", "parent": "2350"}
