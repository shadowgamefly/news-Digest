Doing things with happiness in full flow will have an impact on the things, or certainly your perception of them, and your interaction with others. Everything we do is in a complex set of feedback loops so if we approach the world in a happy mood, its likely to set off those happy fireworks around us. Perhaps our confirmation bias will be set high for happiness too, so we don\u2019t notice the grouches so much when we are happy, unless they pause to poke us in the eye. But experience tells me that happiness is serendipitous. It\u2019s not the thought that comes first, or the aim that is true. Happiness, more often than not, is a surprise and appears under random upturned stones. If you want to find happiness, do the happy things more. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep trying new things. Being in a happy mode makes lots of things easier, that\u2019s for sure. ", "username": "mayhewnick", "parent": "2359"}
