So, for instance, I just watched the first season of BBC\u2019s Home Fires and totally loved it. I loved the way that it\u2019s a layered story\u200a\u2014\u200athe story of middle aged women in the middle of the last century and how they live and how they get along together. But it\u2019s also about war and how men in that time responded to war. Conversely, I\u2019ve tried to watch Supernatural about a dozen times and I can\u2019t get through the first season. Why not? I like each individual episode\u200a\u2014\u200aso why do I keep losing the thread of the show? It\u2019s because the episodes are SO self-contained that when one\u2019s done, it\u2019s super easy to just stop. There isn\u2019t anything pulling me through to the next episode. No over arching story arch. ", "title": "", "parent": "626", "creatorid": "799bdc99a0fd", "id": "6ee7c2b04e86"}
