{"name": "413_4", "child": "", "content": "\u201cBy contrast, Pepsi\u2019s ad offers up nothing about what the soda maker believes.\u201d I assume that the Pepsi company believes the same thing as any of the companies you laud; in making as much money as possible by selling as much product as possible. You accuse Pepsi of being vacuous for not jumping on every latest politically correct pity party that comes along in order to virtue signal to its market, and to sell more product. But it is obvious that vacuous is exactly what you\u2019re demanding from Pepsi. Companies are about making money. That is all any of them are about. If you were being honest (or at least not chronically gullible) then you would at least be giving kudos to Pepsi for not pretending to be anything else. A company which is willing to swear allegiance, however temporarily to the latest populist fad (as many of them do with your approval) will just as quickly swear allegiance to the next orthodoxy. Just ask IBM. And an aside: North Carolina does not discriminate against \u201ctransgender communities\u201d (whatever they are.) There are no laws on the books in North Carolina that discriminate against any citizen no matter what they imagine themselves to be. Maybe you should look that up. It isn't difficult to check the facts. ", "title": "", "parent": "413", "creatorid": "e91a7dc9cd62", "id": "3d1836cc632e"}
