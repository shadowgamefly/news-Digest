{"content": "Daniel, I\u2019d encourage you to read Cagan and Vogel\u2019s Creating Breakthrough Products. Cagan and Vogel devoted an entire chapter to the subject of integrated product teams 16 years ago\u2014and there\u2019s plenty of other prior art out there. Yes, integrated product teams are important\u2026 but there\u2019s so much more depth to this discussion. A good place to start is understanding the perceptual biases/gaps between engineers, marketers, and designers. Cagan and Vogel (and Weingart), being the good academics that they are, actually did a study on this subject: \u201cUnderstanding Perceptual Gaps in Integrated Product Development Teams.\u201d Disciplines absolutely need to overlap to create great products. Successful team management, though, requires proper understanding of the differences between them. Preserving product integrity from conception to production is really, really difficult. Simply integrating teams isn\u2019t enough. Handwaving away the structural differences between disciplines (perception, biases, responsibilities, power structures, &c.) by placing them all under the nebulous umbrella of \u201cdesign decisions\u201d isn\u2019t actionable, tactical advice.
