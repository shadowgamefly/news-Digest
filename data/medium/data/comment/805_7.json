Up until the article hit HN, I didn\u2019t have enough traffic to do a true A/B split test so I was actually doing a swap out test to see if minimizing the focus on plans and just focusing on the starting price point combined with a shorter trial (24 hours) would drive more people to trial. Once the tsunami of HN traffic hit, I was like \u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME?!\u201d because I would have preferred to have a more traditional 7\u201314 day trial with a pricing page. Rather than panic, try to swap things around last minute, and potentially create issues I just decided to grin and bear it. I checked out your SaaS site\u200a\u2014\u200apretty ambitious! I\u2019m actually looking at adding some machine learning functionality to Tamboo in the coming months to do predictive behavior analysis. We should stay in touch and compare notes! Shoot me a line through the contact form on Tamboo or on Twitter if you\u2019re up for that. ", "title": "", "parent": "805", "creatorid": "55e9fd9a459", "id": "2a67412195a"}
