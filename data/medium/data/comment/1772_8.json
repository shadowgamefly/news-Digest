Conservative media subverted critique by positioning *themselves* as the unbiased media critics (we report, you decide). So the message can\u2019t simply be, \u201cdon\u2019t trust the official story\u201d\u2026. because for all the talk of personal responsibility, at some point, trust in *someone* is necessary. The most clever manipulators earn that trust through flattery and tribal signals\u2026 \u201cyou can\u2019t trust anyone, but hey, we trust you.\u201d As for the futility of fact-checking, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to get much worse. In my industry (3D/VR), we\u2019re very close to the point where someone can quickly create a realistic 3D model of your face, simply using publicly-available images from Google, and quickly create a realistic model of your voice, simply using publicly-available clips on YouTube. They can then animate this virtual avatar to say anything. And it will look very real. The path forward is hazy indeed, but I suspect we need to be thinking less about truth and verification, and more about trust and tribalism.
