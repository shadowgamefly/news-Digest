I gather a lot of it comes down to vigilante/lazy justice in many cases. I had assumed my \u201cnever tried\u201d mention equated saying the black-on-white rape was merely an allegation but I guess that\u2019s heavy-lifting for you. (Odds are, a wrongful allegation. I think blacks knew all too well what the outcome would be to even consider it, as To Kill a Mockingbird depicted so well, if simply.) I\u2019m fine about much of what you say, except the patronizing \u201clynching looks nothing like\u201d the picture I chose. Sure it does. Some of the time. Much of the time, even. Not all the time, obviously. I know lynching covered a wide range, but hanging certainly did factor into it. Often, too. It was an effective \u201cstatement,\u201d a hanging corpse left till dawn.
