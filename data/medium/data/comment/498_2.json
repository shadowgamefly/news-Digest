{"name": "498_2", "child": "", "content": "Hi Vishal, I really like the article. There are some great books, courses and must-reads on there. I would highly suggest adding the following book: Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid It is possibly the one of the best and most accessible introductions I have ever seen to neural networks and ML. I would also recommend some resources that I wrote about a post (link). Firstly the Georgia Tech introduction to machine learning and unsupervised learning are very acessible and free. There is also a video of Ben Hamner from Kaggle explaining common pitfalls encountered when trying to do machine learning. Apart from the above suggestions, I would argue that examples 1 & 2 in the why section are the same problem. They are learning to rank problems, recommendations and search, are the same in that given some input entities, whether these are textual queries, or some user entity, find an optimal ranking of some entites based on the given entity and some objective criteria. E.g. Google search. For a given textual input, rank all web documents, whereby the user is most likely to click a document and dwell on it\u2019s content. E.g. Netflix. Given some users interaction history, rank all movies and tv shows whereby the user is most likely to watch the entirety of the movie/tv show and have a positive sentiment towards that movie/tv show. Once again good post and great links to content. Best, Jon ", "title": "", "parent": "498", "creatorid": "a65ac450f568", "id": "3ad73636cb14"}
