How do you \u201cracially profile\u201d Muslims when there is no ethnic requirement to be a member of the religion? Does this fool think that only Arabs are Muslims? Guess he is completely unaware of the fact that the country with the most Muslim residents is Indonesia, and that at least one group in the Middle Eastern area is a caucasian group referred to as Circassians\u200a\u2014\u200awhite skin, red hair, blue eyes! There have been a number of Circassians identified within ISIS, so perhaps \u201cracially profiling\u201d people won\u2019t do any good. I just don\u2019t see how one can use a racial stereotype to identify a religious affiliation. I just don\u2019t. In fact, it pisses me off when people assume I\u2019m a Christian because I appear to be of northern European descent! What a load of hogwash.
