{"content": "Though Hoiberg has yet to prove he\u2019s an NBA caliber coach, IMO the blame falls more on Forman & Paxson. Their free agent acquisitions & trades (Rondo, Wade, Rose for Lopez, even Pau) have undermined strong drafting of players that can actually play & thrive in Hoiberg\u2019s system (Portis, McDermott, Valentine, Mirotic, Zipser, Felicio). Although the presence of veteran leadership in the locker room is under-appreciated in the modern NBA, veteran leadership has to come from production over big name players past their prime. It seems that the Bulls will turn the ship around once they commit to Butler & the youth movement, and find a PG who can shoot. Unfortunately for him, Hoiberg will probably not be around to steer the ship. ", "child": "", "parent": "38", "title": "", "creatorid": "7c3f6993de0e", "name": "38_3", "id": "22fb940fcd6e"}
