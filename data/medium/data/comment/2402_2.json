If an attacker can derive this password, he has control over all passwords protected by this manager. In theory, you could achieve a higher security through one more secure password, but in reality it isn\u2019t so secure as the user probably won\u2019t choose a long password if he has to enter it every time he wants to login into a service. And there\u2019s additional code which can have bugs, in the case of password managers most bugs will be security related. Honestly, I don\u2019t have statistically evidence for my claims, but it seems pretty logical to me. I also think, I read about security researches of TU Darmstadt discovering several security vulnerabilities some weeks/months ago, but I could be wrong about this. However, interesting point!
