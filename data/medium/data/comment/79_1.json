I agree with regards to your comment around \u2018ranking\u2019 and \u2018recommendation\u2019 being the same. In terms of a search engine, the customer adds a query for which the results have to be ranked. But in case of \u2018recommendation\u2019 engine the customer does not have to enter any query. The ML algorithm/model decides what is best for you based on a lot of variables. And user history becomes another extra variable for the ML model. But in essence (i.e at the ML model level) it is suggesting the best result possible to the customer. Thank you once again for stopping by and providing some thoughtful feedback. \u2014 Vishal ", "creatorid": "37d499c6e7ae", "title": "", "parent": "79", "child": "", "name": "79_1"}
