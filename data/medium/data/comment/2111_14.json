I wanted to find a line to highlight, but really the whole writing succinctly and precisely sums up the major flaws in how Westerners have viewed mediation as a means to an end, as though we always need to be achieving something. I was first introduced to Zen philosophy through Alan Watts, but after reading Philip Kapleau I realized how little attention Watts paid to practice. I try to meditate daily but can always use more motivation, this piece helps. I also feel more inspired to read Dogen now, I have always enjoyed quotes from him, and I previously enjoyed reading older Zen writing, specifically Basho. ", "name": "2111_14", "id": "15fd8ee130e2"}
