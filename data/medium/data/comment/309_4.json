{"name": "309_4", "child": "", "content": "Excellent, excellent list. However, I must disagree with this one: \u201cDon\u2019t Start A Relationship If You\u2019re Not In Love\u201d Arranged marriages have a higher success rate than romantically-formed marriages. I\u2019m not advocating arranged marriage, but I\u2019m illustrating that love is much more of a choice than it is a feeling. My wife and I are *opposites*. We didn\u2019t realize this before we were married. As a result, the first few years were less than fun. But, we\u2019ve stuck it out and have a sweet, mature love and respect for each other. And the fact that we\u2019re opposites actually helps us in our work together (we do pre-engagement and premarital counseling for couples). I would, instead, say, \u201cDon\u2019t Start a Relationship If You Don\u2019t have Compatible Life Goals/Similar Mission.\u201d This will take a couple much farther. Grace be with you.
