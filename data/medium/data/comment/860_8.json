{"name": "860_8", "child": "", "content": "If the Soul is the place which records our every experience, then my superhero power would be the ability to see into Souls. I would never again judge based upon the superficial evidence of my eyes. I would be kinder. I would stick my chin out more often for strangers and for those I love, again and again without limit. I would suffer often but the rewards would come more often. And when it is my turn to stumble, someone would stop me falling. Until one day I once again exercise that intrinsically human last resort; the ability to choose my response. To choose actions which build self esteem and personal mastery so that day by day I can fight back to independence. I hope your brother finds the strength to rediscover and rebuild himself. Never give up. Hope is a torture but it is also our salvation. ", "title": "", "parent": "860", "creatorid": "25d3ba16ca7a", "id": "968740960c53"}
