It\u2019s a mindset in which nothing that contradicts the theory is taken as anything other than evidence that the theory is true.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s the equivalent of \u201cbricking\u201d your phone, for a neural network. Once a person believes in a conspiracy theory, all evidence to the contrary is interpreted in a way as to reinforce the theory. So the brain has been wired into an unrecoverable state. It\u2019s a positive feedback loop. Skepticism, however, *should* be encouraged since it is the basic impulse which leads to questioning, searching for answers, and therefore science itself. The fact that conspiracy theorists are skeptical of official-sounding pronouncements is good\u2026however the fact that they reject all evidence contrary to their own beliefs is what makes them less than scientists, who actively *try* to disprove their own theories and are open to any evidence that disproves them.
