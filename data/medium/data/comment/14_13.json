{"content": "Amazing job! I have to say that a lot of times I haven\u2019t found scores useful at all. Reviews are useful for the extremes: when the majority of people say it is good, it tends to be good (8\u201310 scores), and also when they say it is very bad (1\u20134, normally people are not that cruel) they are bad. (I changed a little bit your scale, but 7 movies are not a safe bet for me!) But \u201cin the middle\u201d (4\u20138) it is difficult. I mean, if you like a genre (horror, for example) you can really enjoy something with a 6 (some of my favorite movies, my 8\u201310 scores, are movies with an average of 6\u20137 in IMDB or Metacritic) For the purpose of discovering I relay more in a mix of genre + specific critics (and the score as a third variable). For me it would be perfect to get a score based only on the scores of people with similar taste (or at least that those scores weighed more), but I guess it is complicated! A couple of real examples: I gave a 9 to Splice (5,8 in IMDB and 66 in Metacritic)I gave a 10 to Martyrs (7,1 in IMDB, 53% in rotten tomatoes, no Metacritic score and no Fandango I think) ", "child": "", "parent": "14", "title": "", "creatorid": "b97a9b83d273", "name": "14_13", "id": "d7a3fa4f22a6"}
