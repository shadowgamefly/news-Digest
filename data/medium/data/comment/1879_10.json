{"name": "1879_10", "child": "", "content": "My story is just one of thousands that exemplify how Canada\u2019s welcoming approach to immigration spurs innovation and prosperity for the nation. Canada does not have a wide open immigration approach. Certainly not compared to the USA\u2019s huge numbers and I believe we are considered behind the UK and many other European countries. Something that would \u2018exemplify\u2019 Canada\u2019s predatory approach would be \u2018Pay to Play\u2019 and the 1000\u2019s of \u2018Fuer Dai\u2019, Chinese rich kids/anchors all over Vancouver and Toronto. And anyone (including my wife who\u2019s not rich) will be treated like criminals until they prove themselves innocent. And they still won\u2019t get so much as a 3-month visitor visa. Indeed, Canada will take in the cream of other people\u2019s crops. It takes a village and millions of man-hours to finally produce one doctor or engineer of their own. Canada will steal him or her in a minute. In fact, immigrating to Canada is so insulting, so bureaucratic, such an outdated system, so condescending, so long, so expensive, so full of arrogant immigration officers that I cannot comprehend why in the living fuck anyone normal human being would even bother trying? To compensate for their \u2018Buy a House and Win a Passport\u2019 greedy highest-bidder approach they go dead-opposite on immigrants taking in Somalian Pirates, Venezuelan Killer and take cash from Germany to take Bosnians. All of whom will laugh and savage the weak Canadians who don\u2019t even fight back when you punch them in the face \u201cHere watch\u00a0\u2026. I can fuck him up and he won\u2019t even fight back\u2026\u201d and this before they murder each other, stab each other and secretly \u2018fist pump\u2019 when a Jihadist terror attack is reported. we were given forged Italian passports, and this reminds me why you aren\u2019t anything but the near \u2018opposite example\u2019 of what has happened around the West. And I quote that part because just a few weeks ago we were talking about the \u2018Italian\u2019 Iranians. Everyone in New York or Edmonton over 40 knew exactly what that was. The 70s era wave of Muslim immigrants. They were (like your parents) the opponents of the Islamic Revolution. They were often doctors, engineers or academics of some sort. Often the more modern types. They quickly integrated and were usually just assumed to be \u2018Italians\u2019. Because Italian was the most \u2018Middle-Eastern\u2019 thing we sorta knew, they had black hair, dark eyes, olive-skin tones and most Canadians in the 70s just sorta figured the names sounded Italian. Najatti, Bablatti, Yabbassi, Cobretti.. I dunno, like Italian or Greek maybe? They almost always took \u2018Anglicized names\u2019 like Joey or the famous \u2018Moe\u2019. Every neighbourhood had a \u2018Moe\u2019. Possibly a Greek restaurant that served Persian food. indeed, the 70s era (the pre-islamic revolution) era Muslims really did seem to have a thing for Camaros, Firebirds, gold chains and we recently had a laugh at an old uncle who, for 20 years insisted he had a rivalry with the \u2018Wops\u2019 when growing up in Edmonton. The other uncles, [at least 20 year later] finally realized that none of the neighbourhood rivals were Italians but were instead, Iranians, Iraqis or \u2018Persians\u2019. My own dad had a long-time friend who my father kept telling people was a \u2018Greek or something like that\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t until they were adults he found out the guy was an Albanian. My dad doesn\u2019t know what (or where) Albania is so he decided Reb is still \u2018Greek or something\u2019. And these are the people I grew up with. The neighbours. They put on amazing meals at the Summer ethnic food fairs and I can tell you right now\u200a\u2014\u200aI cannot think of a single problem. There was no such term (nor would it be imagine) as \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 and to be honest I don\u2019t think we knew what Islam was. Alladin and flying carpets or something? Not a single bad word, not a problem in any sense from anyone ever. Not from those Muslims or anyone ever in my entire upbringing and early life until.. ..the \u2018Post-Islamic\u2019 2000+ Muslims show up. It\u2019s not even that they have more \u2018Islamic Extremists\u2019. Or are more militant. Its almost more of a hatred, an arrogance, and then seeing the world through a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 mentality. Now add the post-modern obsession with identity politics that is poisoning the West. Now add Islamic terror attacks. And if you need to know, this isn\u2019t going well for our 70s era secular Persian \u201cItalian\u201d immigrants either. Now, they find themselves walking past a mosque full of the same people who killed your dad. And there is now more of them than you. And you might not even be considered a true Muslim by some of them. You represent something that was just fine. You definitely do not represent any example of what is happening now though. And Canada Immigration is a Predator. ", "title": "", "parent": "1879", "creatorid": "e85e4aa990f9", "id": "25931fc153ba"}
