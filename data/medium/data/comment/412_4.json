{"name": "412_4", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m not sure this goes against aggregation theory. From Ben\u2019s post: \u201cno longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be aggregated at scale leaving consumers/users as a first order priority.\u201d Nobody here owns distribution. Zomato can decide, just like Swiggy has, that delivery times have an outsized outcome on user experience and work to improve them. \u201cBy extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience..\u201d So though it definitely matters, distribution is not a chokepoint, and sure, people are less likely to change once they\u2019ve signed up but that doesn\u2019t mean Swiggy already won. They\u2019ve only lived so far. ", "title": "", "parent": "412", "creatorid": "5b36489e7943", "id": "edcbf22a0e51"}
