Please do not back down. You have an opportunity unlike at any other time to be a moral leader now. We need you and will back you up. And I\u2019m a lifelong democrat. But I love this country as you do and now, more than ever, country must be put ahead of party. I believe you have the strength to stand up to those who will oppose your mission (our mission) so please keep speaking the truth. I am with you.
