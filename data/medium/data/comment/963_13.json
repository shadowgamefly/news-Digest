{"name": "963_13", "child": "", "content": "I applaud this speech, but anxiously await the moral leadership John McCain advocates\u2026from McCain himself. The unwinding McCain warns against is happening here at home and narry a word about Trump or recent policies undertaken. Only when Republican statesmen like him fully speak out against the tyranny and bigotry of Donald Trump and the leaders like him will his words have true meaning. It\u2019s not enough to point out issues in the abstract and simply say \u201cwe\u201d need to do something about it. Pls #SenatorMcCain, be the voice who finally says enough is enough and put country above party. The country needs your service and leadership more than ever. #dontcountmccainout ", "title": "", "parent": "963", "creatorid": "f6e5bc120f91", "id": "7a538b36fed1"}
