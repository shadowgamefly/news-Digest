{"name": "475_5", "child": "", "content": "Writing is my preferred form of self-expression, so I don\u2019t usually have to force it, it just comes whenever I have something to say. However, I have gone through dry spells, even long ones, usually because fiction and non-fiction take turns in my writing activity, and because there is such a thing as writing fatigue. I\u2019ve been on a roll with non-fiction recently, but fiction has suffered as a consequence. Maybe you\u2019re done with non-fiction and need to move on to something different? Have you been distracted by some other projects? I don\u2019t do much except let it come to me. It just does, kicking at the insides of my skull until I let it out.
