{"name": "606_16", "child": "", "content": "Good story. It looks like you ran into the proverbial systems engineering problem of exponentially increasing complexity and the mythical \u201cman-hour\u201d. It is the nature of technological projects my friend. I actually find these problems to be quite interesting. The fast that as the system gets bigger, the developers of the system themselves become another system, with their own development needs. I work at an avionics company (building cockpits for aircraft). I don\u2019t even know how many people work on the systems I work on (hundreds). I would say the worst thing we do here is we don\u2019t engineer the development system (the people). It sounds like software companies can be the same way. Like your experience, everyone thinks their part is the MOST important part, and we grumble, have communication issues, and sometime move slower then the molasses in January. The thing that makes this tolerable is that I work in the group that one of our jobs is to engineer a solution to this most complex system of all, the people. I actually think that is the most interesting part of my job (sick, I know). ", "title": "", "parent": "606", "creatorid": "d86fa7fb102", "id": "f6632a49f9f4"}
