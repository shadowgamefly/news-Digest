{"name": "438_8", "child": "", "content": "Nope, never had a womb, although perhaps tech will make that viable someday. I don\u2019t think any man or woman alive today can predict the rate at which women will want to give birth naturally vs through an artificial womb. We won\u2019t know until it\u2019s an option. Right now, the US maternal death rate during childbirth is ~18/100,000; infant mortality is ~600/100000. The point is that artificial wombs will probably, eventually be easier and safer for both parent and baby. In that case, some will choose the natural method, but many will choose the safer method -especially women who might have high-risk pregnancies. Also keep in mind that some single males will choose to gestate children this way, as well as gay couples. ", "title": "", "parent": "438", "creatorid": "29327d16a418", "id": "9446553841d9"}
