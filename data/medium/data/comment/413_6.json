{"name": "413_6", "child": "", "content": "One more reason, following on a lifetime of them, that I have resolved long since to get the presence of any form of advertising out of my sensate experience whatsoever. I don\u2019t do cable or satellite TV primarily because advertising on TV is an insult to the intelligence of a two-year-old, I don\u2019t listen to commercial radio because its advertising is even more gratingly, stupidly, asininely offensive than TV\u2019s is, I don\u2019t look at print media if it has ads in it, and I have a standing policy to even go out of my way to never purchase anything that has been advertised at me. To the extent that popup ads do assault me online, I diligently ignore them. The ad industry as a whole is a disgrace. The very idea that anyone needs to shout and bluster and dramatize and insult just to sell products and services, suggests those items aren\u2019t worth buying to begin with. If advertising is limited to supplying information which may be informative or useful, I can recognize how it is a beneficial service to link buyers with sellers. I have a humble business card I hand out, and its function is to offer people a printed record of my phone number. If the jobs I do aren\u2019t promotion enough, if the people I do them for aren\u2019t reputation enough, I never had any business doing business in the first place. But using third-rate actors and idiotic, insulting, sub-juvenile scenarios, and researched emotional manipulation devices, to essentially hypnotize people into delivering up their money for how doing so might make them feel, is one of the most damning indictments of our civilization, by willfully aggrandizing the surrendering of the dignity and autonomy of adult human beings in trade for hollow promises of imposed desires being gratified. Did I mention that advertising kinda annoys me? ", "title": "", "parent": "413", "creatorid": "bdc93f756837", "id": "ca650bec83e0"}
