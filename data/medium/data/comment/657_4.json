{"name": "657_4", "child": "", "content": "This is beautiful, Louise, really! You are proving my pet theory, that each human being has a story, starting with a childhood that has its ups and downs. Now here comes my theoretical part; I have no proof of my theory, but I truly believe: THEY\u2019RE ALL INTERESTING AS FUCK! I will try to type up a similar summary of MY childhood, to help bolster my theory, along with Louise\u2019s story here, which I believe we all can agree on, is very interesting, indeed! I never grew up on the beach, in Portugal, did you? No! But Louise did. Nice story, Louise. Now we could, hypothetically look forward to chapter the Second: the Adult Years, from you, Louise. (Pardon me if you\u2019ve already published that here. I\u2019ll look for it. I only just followed you five minutes ago. I\u2019m behind, for sure!
