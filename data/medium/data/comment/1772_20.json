{"name": "1772_20", "child": "", "content": "Do you really have a deep respect for scientific inquiry? If so, then you\u2019d know that labels are different than facts. That narratives are different then the truth. Above all that inquiry is completely different than understanding. The asking of questions and the acceptance of the answers without probing either the relevance of or motivation behind the answers, gives the impression of knowledge without giving the substance of understanding. In the above comment you state that your privilege as a scholar offers you some sort of insight. Yet nowhere do you offer how that insight is or was the result of privilege. It may appear that going to college is a sort of privilege, but how was that obtained?Was effort necessary to obtain admittance into College, from which your scholarship could commence? If that be the case then doesn\u2019t it logically follow that you are not privileged so much as accomplished? Therefore in your own writing there is a strain of false rhetoric, designed to claim something to be different than it really is for the sake of misleading your readers. To send a false signal of solidarity with a preconceived standard of thought that says \u201cthough I may be questing you, I am still one of you, in agreement that my accomplishments are really just my privilege; that I\u2019m pretending that I\u2019m not better than you, even as I preach down to you, because I know real from fake\u201d. You can\u2019t honestly see the truth if you can\u2019t even see the biases in your own writing. In the subtle ways in which you seek to deceive, probably not even knowing that or how you\u2019re doing it. I however see it quite clearly and therefore dismiss most of this as simply as a biased attempt to persuade others that they\u2019ve been deceived by acting deceitfully in pushing a narrative along leftist lines of indoctrination.
