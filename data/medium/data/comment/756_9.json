Everything mentioned in this article has and is already happening. Who is the last to know here? Becoming aware and accepting it is the hard part. I do not intend to feed into the fear. Most of this was going on before people became aware of it and we are still here. I do not believe that now or ever have I had privacy and that my information has always been available if anyone took the time to acquire it or use it. I do not believe that I am in control over how my information is used. There is a part of me that has an imagination and would like to take control over that. It is what it is. The most absurd thing is making rules or laws that we all know many of us cannot or would not follow. It does however take the high out of sneaking around when it is apparent there is no privacy. What does anyone think they are getting away with? I think the virtual world has become more real to a lot of people then the actual reality. I can see how it can have its attractions. Welcome to the world of transparency that we live in. If you have not been here before and are awakening we are here to help calm and give light.
