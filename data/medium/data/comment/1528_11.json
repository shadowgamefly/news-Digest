Team Obama/Hillary cozied up to some very unsavory characters to oppose Assad after he relented to several demands to cancel the state of emergency status there and cooled the public sentiment for a majority of dissenting Syrians. Keeping a revolution going after the dissenters are satisfied is not the work of your run of the mill Mohamed Q Public. We know from experience in Libya that brutal dictators who go all warm and fuzzy are wasting the effort, but what comes \u201cafter\u201d we oust a newly popular leader? In most revolutions there is a figurehead that is assumed to become the new leader should the revolution succeed and the tyrant is deposed. In our past support of revolutions and movements in the region, we have left the countries to the rebels in spite of the fact that their leaders aren\u2019t even from the neighborhood and no one with governance experience has stepped up to claim the title of leader. This has only led to power vacuums and disarray between radical factions that immediately turn on us, and the citizens we \u201cliberated\u201d. So far, Syria has shown no evidence of being an exception to this and the extra factor of another super power with its own interests to support adds an additional unknown element. Is Libya the model for post revolution countries that we create? Is the removal of Assad a step toward, or away from, peace in the region? Is peace even our end game? What say you deep state?
