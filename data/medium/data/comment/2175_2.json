In today\u2019s world there is so much talk about ecosystems.We have ecosystems of software,vendors,trade and multiple other things. But the one real definition of ecosystem which everybody conveniently forgets is that \u201ca ecosystem is a place where knowledge and information is shared so that everybody benefits.\u201dWe need to implement ecosystems in our personal life and productivity improvements also.We need to create an environment where we win along with others,we succeed along with others and we help others to cope up with failures. So my take is the more we share and collaborate,the more we align our goals with community goals,the more we win as a whole.This is the way we achieve a balanced society. Competition is passe now. Collaboration is the key to success. ", "name": "2175_2", "id": "2c0a56f1844f"}
