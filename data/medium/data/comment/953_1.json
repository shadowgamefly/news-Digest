{"name": "953_1", "child": "", "content": "The missing\u00a0fraud There is a fine legal distinction between saying that public funds are \u2018missing\u2019 and saying that it is \u2018unaccounted for\u2019. In the first, the implication is that a crime has been committed. \u2018Unaccounted for\u2019 merely says that a crime might have been committed. The distinction is important for the public prosecutor: a \u2018might have\u2019 can be ignored with little question (which is why there is so little action taken on the huge VAWA frauds, even though it is the Department of Justice themselves who administer its $600m every year to feminists). With money unnacounted for, it can continually be argued that it is not shown that money was stolen, so no crime needs to be investigated. $6bn is about $20 for every man, woman and child in the USA. Not being one of the super-wealthy, if I thought I had $20 in my empty wallet but I couldn\u2019t account for it, I would be concerned enough to look until I either found it, or determined that it was, indeed, missing.
