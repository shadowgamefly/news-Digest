{"content": "Bill and House make the argument that a triple double is arbitrary, but then argue that a player should have to win 50 games to win MVP. Both are arbitrary numbers. And while they make the argument that a few rebounds and assists shouldn't matter, why not 2\u20133 wins? Further, Westbrook isn't just averaging a triple double of 20, 10, and 10, he is leading the league in scoring, and PER (which was previously how we compared greatness), and tops harden in RPM, and WINS. He also tops Harden in on/off splits and is actually more efficient in other aspects of the game (like rebounding, assist, turnover rate). So the efficiency argument with Harden is entirely based on offensive possessions and shooting. And he is extremely efficient within those indicators, almost entirely because the team was set up to be precisely that (efficient). Efficiency isn't the only thing that matters in the NBA and we shouldn't base MVP decisions and discussions entirely on efficiency. it should be an element, just like the other statistical indicators, which by and large Westbrook dominates (both traditional and advanced). Further the argument that MVP should only come from a contender is idiotic. Jordan in 87\u201388 hit 50 wins on the dot, yet put up one of the best statistical seasons of all time, the bulls then lost in 5 games in the second round. The bulls weren't championship contenders at that point, so would Bill and House think Jordan shouldn't have won MVP bc the bulls weren't not true contenders? What if the bulls won 49 instead of 50 games? Also, lets be real, there are only really 2, maybe 3 contenders for the title this year, GSW, Cleveland, and the Spurs. And btw WEstbrook is putting up numbers someone thought would never happen. But yeah, lets be ashamed to vote for him. ridiculous.
