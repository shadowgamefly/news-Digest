Yet\u200a\u2014\u200agive it 9, 12 or 18 months\u200a\u2014\u200aand it was all dead, gone, buried. I would LOVE to use newer frameworks (environments) such as REACT, but, I and thousands with me, have burned our fingers seriously, in that\u200a\u2014\u200awhen we have worked with the framework for some time, then it stops being there. It simply stops! We are then left at the mercy of coincidence\u200a\u2014\u200aand nobody in professional software development wants scenarios where they create something for their clients\u200a\u2014\u200aonly to have to add bills of USD 5,000+ simply because of that the framework you delivered under, no longer exists. So questions: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE\u200a\u2014\u200aI am starting (!) using frameworks when they have grown some molds (18+ months of age on the market and still supported). We have seen so so so many frameworks, which each of them had very good functionality, each of them solving certain problems\u200a\u2014\u200abut\u200a\u2014\u200athey never survived the tooth of time. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE\u200a\u2014\u200ahow shall we go about this problem? We have hundreds if not thousands of contributors of code\u200a\u2014\u200abut they never receive the credit for their work, thus they simply die off before they can even raise to stardom. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE\u200a\u2014\u200aWHAT shall we do? I have been successfully sticking to the older stuff (18+ months of age), but surely I would want to put in the newer stuff\u200a\u2014\u200aif I had a guarantee that it would be developed on, improved on, supported. I would not even mind paying for it. Advertising it. But\u200a\u2014\u200aprovided that the author actually does something about it.
