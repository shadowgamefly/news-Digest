{"content": "I\u2019m happy you figured out what makes you more happy. I have a webdesign business myself but I mainly love to design things, money comes next. A friend of mine is always talking about the money on his freelance development C# career. He really don\u2019t get the point of life in my opinion. Your story really looks like his life, when I advise things in a positive direction with all respect he gets angry sometimes. He just became father and looks almost depressed at times. Don\u2019t really know what to do for him. Think time will guide him. I\u2019m just over 34 and I love doing music and work in my green garden project where I wrote about here on Medium as well. I also have a link there to my Youtube. My point is that I enjoy thinking and doing things without making money but spending and making time on great things. After all we all need to enjoy this world and give our life the best we can. Money is a great tool to get something done. Much respect to your writing!
