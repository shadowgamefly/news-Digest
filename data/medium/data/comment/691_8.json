{"name": "691_8", "child": "", "content": "No one here seems to have mentioned the most obvious flaw of Kanban: that it relies on units of work following the same set of phases in the same order. (Well, more or less.) Kanban started in factories, a fact reflected in its uncompromising structure. It\u2019s a linear process from A to B to C. This happens to work well for some kinds of work, like adding features to software. Many people have work that is not so simply structured. Unfortunately the system has become trendy beyond those spheres in which it works best. Sometimes in an underconsidered attempt to inject transparency, something more like gross oversimplification happens, especially if the work units involved are sufficiently varied.
