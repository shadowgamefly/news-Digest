{"name": "955_2", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m embarrassed by people I stood with in support of Obama. No president is perfect, and certainly Big O had faults and made choices I disagreed with. I think that\u2019s at least healthy. But holy crap. This is what we do when we lose? Gross. I remember how much time we spent deriding Trump and his supporters for claiming the election was rigged. Then Trump won and IMMEDIATELY everyone started claiming the election had been rigged, votes were hacked, Russia somehow did it, and oh my god, here\u2019s ONE example of a Trump supporter who voted twice. It was disgusting. My only solace is that this isn\u2019t a uniquely Democratic trait. It\u2019s a human one. Cave-man level, but still human. I detest Trump, and I disagree with you that he\u2019s better than Hillary (not sure I buy the idea that she would have gleefully thrown us into a nuclear war), but I actually think we needed this. We need to set fire to the forest sometimes to clear out the dead and rotting debris. I think we\u2019ll survive Trump, I just hope we come out on the other side having learned stuff, on BOTH sides of the aisle.
