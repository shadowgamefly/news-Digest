{"name": "418_7", "child": "", "content": "Ha! I think I could argue Google Fiber was everything it was intended to be. The potential threat of The Mighty Google would inspire the established access provider superpowers to up their game (i.e. increase their coverage and speed). We\u2019re seeing this happen, yes?Fact: More and faster access \u2014regardless of the provider \u2014is good for Google. Google Fiber\u2019s losses can\u2019t be measured by just looking at the silo alone. Context matters. If #1 worked, and it appears it has (at least to some extent) then Fiber\u2019s ROI is positive. Imagine that, enter a handful of markets and see the broader pie grow. A lot.Worst case, that play fails. Then Google is in a position\u200a\u2014\u200aevidence in hand\u200a\u2014\u200ato lobby the government, as well as the public on how the established superpowers are neglecting their duties.Google doesn\u2019t need to do EVERYTHING. It just wants to show it can be done. Google is an algorithm company first, with product company being a distant second. (Yes, of course, there are a couple outlier exceptions.)

I don\u2019t disagree with your analysis per se. I\u2019m just not so sure your context is broad and complete enough. I\u2019m not suggesting I\u2019ve nailed it either\u200a\u2014\u200ajust that there\u2019s a bit more here to consider. And I wanted to make some food for thought suggestions.
