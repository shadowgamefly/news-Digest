They\u2019re job is to help guide your business to a level where they see a return on investment. Alienating certain clients doesn\u2019t do that. On my personal account I supported the Women\u2019s March.

Also, what happens the next time that she has a disagreement with an investor. Because while we don\u2019t know the guy\u2019s names, people in the community know who she\u2019s talking about and now you\u2019re talking about reputations which are a large part of what an investor lives on.To complete the article, what\u2019s the percentage of men who receive VC funding? And then what\u2019s the relative percentage (if both were 50/50)?The general sentiment of the article is great.

I just think that some of the views from the subjects seemed to make light of certain issues such as misogyny ", "title": "", "parent": "1351", "creatorid": "954ffed5cc88", "id": "8183d50b98a1"}
