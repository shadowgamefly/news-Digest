{"name": "1885_2", "child": "", "content": "As a fellow minority, struggling to find his place in the tech community, I applaud you for being brave enough to weather the storms of entrepreneurship and dive into uncharted territory. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve felt out of place, in school, at meet ups, or online, but truthfully, the higher up the ladder I go, the less colorful it is, so i have become a bit accustomed to it. I can\u2019t speak for every household, but I get the feeling that Tech & Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t pushed as much as it should be in our community, and that is where part of the issue may stem from. I\u2019m currently finishing my MBA and teaching myself to program on the side, but will be transitioning into IT and focusing on entrepreneurial endeavors once complete. Much more success and prosperity to your team at Squire. For what it is worth, I support you guys 100% and hope that you receive everything needed to be an everlasting brand. Keep up the great work. It looks like the stars are aligning for your team. I\u2019ll be rooting for you. ", "title": "", "parent": "1885", "creatorid": "415d8b902c84", "id": "db6b8abd6571"}
