There is no doubt that beginner on-site SEO, keyword research, and basic link building are going to benefit your site\u200a\u2014\u200aby all means, do them. You can find all the info you\u2019d ever need for free online (Moz, Reddit, BHW, wherever). But if you\u2019re a small business owner and think that you can \u201cdo your SEO in one day,\u201d you\u2019ll be left in the dust by those who hired a legitimate search consultant / agency. Actual SEOs also optimize for CTR, site performance, and site architecture. The real trifecta of ranking factors are links (authority), content (context), and your website (performance and on-site factors). Links have an entire industry built around them (digital PR). Content has several billion-dollar industries built around it (digital publishing, content marketing, modern journalism lol). And \u201cthe website\u201d has all of web development behind it. Many technical tasks fall onto the shoulders of a good SEO\u200a\u2014\u200athings like: SSLSite speedServer speed/ setupResponsivenessAMPStructured Data + microdatahreflangrobots.txtSitemap architecting30x redirectsURL structure+Many many others But you\u2019ll never see any of these mentioned in any \u2018SEO is ABC, 123\u2019 guides because they require actual comp sci knowledge. Also, some suggestions like \u201ckeyword density\u201d and \u201cpositioning your keyword in your title tag\u201d are so stupidly dated and bunk, it makes me upset that people are still peddling them as fact. We aren\u2019t in a 2005 internet anymore\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle is smarter than that\u00a0;). So PLEASE, do yourself a favor\u200a\u2014\u200aas a small business owner, yes, learn SEO basics via simple guides, and certainly apply them. But don\u2019t brush off the importance of an entire industry or you will lose a quintessential competitive edge. There\u2019s a reason all big firms hire in-house SEO and SEM teams\u00a0:).
