The robot was a personal project I put on the Instapainting Blog. If you actually looked into it you\u2019ll see that not only are we not using it for anything than a cool demo, it actually requires an artist to paint on it. As far as the Chinese artists and their \u201cmeaningless\u201d work, what does it matter to you that people will pay for such \u201cmeaningless\u201d work and artists in China are willing to do it? Is it meaningless because they are Chinese, or that they are in China? I\u2019m sure the factory workers in China don\u2019t find much meaning in assembling your electronics, yet you probably happily paid for one anyways. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s place to judge what type of artwork is \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Some people want their photos turned into hand-painted paintings. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anyone a service belittling the livelihoods of the artists in China, or questioning the motivations of the people who want such a product. After all, I can\u2019t fathom why anyone would want a Android phone but you don\u2019t see me going around belitting the manufacturers or the people who buy them.
