In my experience empowerment fails when only \u201cresponsibility\u201d is given but no \u201cauthority\u201d is given.This is a very dangerous situation to be in.You are caught for everything that goes wrong but you do not have the authority to make the right decisions and do what it takes to do things for the better. So if Leaders are seriously interested to empower their teams,they must also learn to let go their power and delegate it effectively to the person who needs it the most.
