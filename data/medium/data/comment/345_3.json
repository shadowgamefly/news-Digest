{"name": "345_3", "child": "", "content": "Hi Mark\u200a\u2014\u200athis is very interesting technology, although maybe I\u2019m glad that my daughter is already out of college (ie tech overload). However, I wonder if the Nanit team has thought about applications of their tech for parents of kids with Type 1 Diabetes. Overnight blood sugar lows are one of the scariest aspects of T1D, and I know that we spent many sleepless nights checking on our daughter to make sure her blood sugar wasn\u2019t too low. I\u2019d love to talk to them about this and get them in touch with JDRF if that was an option. Great topic, and congrats on the investment.
