{"name": "1105_2", "child": "", "content": "\u201cCan anyone imagine The Lord\u2019s Prayer recited in a classroom?\u201d Founder and President Martin Mawyer said in a statement on CAN\u2019s website. \u201cOr students taught that the Bible is the inspired, infallible final Word of God? Or displaying the Christian cross in the school classroom? Or lesson plans that encourage students to pray to Jesus Christ? It\u2019s out of the question! Christ, the Bible, the cross and Christian prayer were thrown out our public schools decades ago.\u201d OK, let\u2019s go through these points one at a time. First, the Lord\u2019s Prayer is a prayer. Nobody is asking students to pray any Muslim prayers. Second, nobody is being taught that the Quran is the infallible final Word of God delivered by the Messenger Angel Gabriel (which is what Muslims believe). The Quran is merely being presented as the holy book Muslims use as the base of their faith and the guide for their lives. Third, nobody is demanding that Muslim symbols be displayed in classrooms at all, let alone as an endorsement of a religion as prohibited by the First Amendment. Fourth, students are not being required to pray as Muslims do. This isn\u2019t about prayer. It isn\u2019t about proselytism. It\u2019s not about converting children to Islam. It\u2019s about understanding the mindset of the second-largest religious group on the planet. All of Mawyer\u2019s points have to do not with educating anyone about a particular religion, but about evangelism and converting people to Christianity. And that has no place in a public school classroom. Just as converting people to Islam or any other religion doesn\u2019t belong there. But that\u2019s not what this is.
