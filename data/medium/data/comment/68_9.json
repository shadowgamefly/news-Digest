{"name": "68_9", "child": "", "content": "Noted Trump supporter James Dolan has been making the Knicks great again for the last 15 years. It\u2019s a straight shot, and it\u2019s sad you can\u2019t just grow up and get on with the business of making the Knicks great again. I don\u2019t think anyone has written an article that seriously considers the idea that Phil Jackson might be actively sabotaging the Knicks. I mean, you\u2019re some woke hippy from BasketballLand with your 11 rings and you have to work for one of the bitch orcs from Mordor while he\u2019s giving millions to Trump? I\u2019d fuck that team over, and I like the Knicks. ", "title": "", "parent": "68", "creatorid": "6536d4a3c3ee", "id": "4ed224fdd6d5"}
