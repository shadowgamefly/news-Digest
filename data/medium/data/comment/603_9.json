{"name": "603_9", "child": "", "content": "So them victimising you was essentially them putting snarky but basically true words in your mouth? That sounds terrible. Not quite on a par with publishing a sex tape made of you without your knowledge or consent & then defying a court order to take it down, but hey\u2026 Had it resulted in your dismissal you would have been within your rights to sue. If they could then prove you said it they\u2019d be A-Ok, but the burden of proof should always be on the interviewer. With that in mind all it means for a \u201cfree press\u201d is you don\u2019t tell lies, you keep tapes of interviews, and you keep to what is in the public interest rather than just what the public might be interested in. That makes for a free press and a responsible one. People have been utterly ruined by a gutter press that feels it can just print whatever it wants without regard to the truth, to the effect on those they write about, or to what there\u2019s any need to write about with the result that your \u201ccelebrity\u201d culture is little more than an endless stream of dirty laundry airing that serves nobody well at all.
