{"name": "504_1", "child": "", "content": "Poornima Vijayashanker In life when we do anything the first important thing is to choose\u00a0. To choose the right one which will lift you up. As you said,first to choose between a book\u00a0,course\u00a0, counselling or software\u00a0. Poornima you have beautifully put forward each and every step starting from scratch. You have put forth many advice\u00a0. For example if we are taking a book\u00a0, it is better to be a self published author\u00a0. Which ever one we choose,you have given detailed step for each one\u00a0. You also have mentioned some good third party like stripe\u00a0. Regarding competition, compete with\u00a0yourself,try not to be the person who you were yesterday\u00a0. Loved reading your post\u00a0.
