They see those tears and look doubtful when you say it\u2019s just something in your eye. They overhear the muffled sobs behind the locked bathroom door. They wonder as you almost burn down the house by leaving a hot pad on the hot stovetop because you fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. They hear the messages from bill collectors left on voicemail. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Everything\u2019s going to be okay!\u201d Yeah\u2026 Solution? Drop everything. Call in sick. Forgo school. Spend the day at the zoo or an amusement park or hiking in the woods or swimming in the lake. Remember how to genuinely smile. Let a giggle accompany their innocent belly laugh. Show them it will be okay. Share with them your hopes, and how your striving to make them realities. And always remind them of your unconditional never ending love for them. Even if it\u2019s not okay\u2026 we\u2019ll always have that love\u2026 and that makes it okay. ", "name": "2109_3", "id": "353f559a9a3d"}
