That said\u2026 Between the eager-to-recreate post responses, learnings from the existing bot data you expose, and\u200a\u2014\u200aI suppose\u200a\u2014\u200awhat have become societal norms around perceived personal worth via follower count, my ideal (albeit optimistic) outcomes from this would be: No one else do, or share this. Please. Let\u2019s face it, gaming the system (and effectively, the humans in that system) cheapens and undermines the actual value of any \u2018real\u2019 connection. It\u2019s pretty much automating behaving like a dick.Instagram tighten up the API, specifically set up some algos to spot follow and unfollow behavior from anyone gaming the system to warn, and then suspend them. It\u2019s a slippery slope to twitter quality, and in my view the networks that protect genuine quality over quantity will be the ones that survive and thrive. Personally, my own takeaway is to be more wary about \u2018following back\u2019 on Instagram now. ", "title": "", "parent": "1077", "creatorid": "a8e3b0d8ae52", "id": "55b0e7168eec"}
