You might be more familiar with them being call \u2018common stock\u2019 and \u2018perfered stock\u2019 or \u2018class A\u2019 or \u2018class b\u2019. My own company was organized this way. So I held shares that meant I held 80% of the voting weight and it was a whopping 100 shares, and put 10,000 shares up for sale with almost not voting, but paid dividends. Founds have to protect themselves too, or you end up like Tim Cook, fired and the company goes down the tubes. ", "title": "", "parent": "423", "creatorid": "49a55eb39cec", "id": "dcf933d250b1"}
