{"name": "443_20", "child": "", "content": "I had a brief exchange with Feynman. I\u2019d read some comments of his that dissed the Nobel prize people and took him to task for being an ingrate. I remember writing, \u201cYou think think you\u2019re a curmudgeon, but you\u2019re just a jerk.\u201d He wrote a disarming letter back, saying he\u2019d been grouchy at being awakened in the middle of the night with The Call and said people in Sweden had been very kind blah, blah, blah. Wolfram\u2019s extensive experience\u200a\u2014\u200aactually a relationship\u200a\u2014\u200awith Feynman, and my brief acquaintance, are in agreement. What sums up the man best is, to me, Feynman\u2019s greatest moment, when he was on the Challenger commission. Not content with the script, Feynman went off on his own, snooping around. The suits were pretty upset and tried to rein him in, but not before Feynman had cut through the crap, to the heart of what caused Challenger to crash. I think Richard Feynman\u2019s attitude towards physics is like that of those Cambridge mathematicians, like Hardy, who have little interest in the practical side. They are \u00e6stheticians who see their work as making problems make sense. ", "title": "", "parent": "443", "creatorid": "f0bfd941808b", "id": "b6b1e806f9c5"}
