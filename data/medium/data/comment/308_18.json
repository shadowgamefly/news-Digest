{"name": "308_18", "child": "", "content": "This is a good question because my second most favourite thing is talking about myself. I have hundreds of books, they sit on every available spot around the house. The ones I have still to read sit on the shelf above my desk\u200a\u2014\u200aI salivate at the thought of working my way through them. Choosing my next book to read is always a pleasure. Your question made me look up at my shelf and I noticed that several were books I had already read. These were the books I didn\u2019t want to part with. I didn\u2019t want to put them out of the way and forget about them. Sixteen in total. So I picked one at random (took my age and counted back and forth until I stopped on one). It was: The Fight by Norman Mailer. A mesmeric book about Muhammad Ali and the \u2018Rumble in The Jungle.\u2019 I think I might read it again. At the very least I\u2019ll type in Ali\u2019s name on YouTube and watch Muhammad Ali being majestic and profound. ", "title": "", "parent": "308", "creatorid": "202e3b02c06", "id": "be67e2d6cc58"}
