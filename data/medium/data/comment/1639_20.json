{"name": "1639_20", "child": "", "content": "If you guys think that \u201cFake News\u201d, or anything besides Hillary being horrible candidate, caused Donald Trump\u2019s win, you\u2019re missing the point behind the election. Consider: ) Trump couldn\u2019t have won without converting Obama voters.Trump couldn\u2019t have won without the support of women.Trump couldn\u2019t have won without the support of Blacks and Hispanics.Trump couldn\u2019t have won without the support of young people.Any mention of WikiLeaks is strangely absent in all of these \u201cFake News\u201d discussions. It wasn\u2019t fake news that killed Hillary. It was a peek behind the curtain at a person who was clearly in bed with the banks, seemed like she wanted to start a war with Russia for some reason, was openly and proudly two-faced (us regular folks just call it lying), and was taking money from the same people that are back ISIS. The only reason this was surprising to a number of people is because you were watching MSNBC and CNN, and Fox. All the pundits were inside the Washington echo chamber saying, \u201cYup, this one\u2019s in the bag\u201d. I even heard CNN talking about Hillary\u2019s post election plans when the election was 2 weeks out. We need look no further than CNN for \u201cFake News\u201d, I saw: ) A CNN anchor coaching a focus group to give pro-Hillary comments on a live mike) A CNN anchor say openly that they were Hillary\u2019s \u201cbest supporters\u201d and gave her a \u201cfree ride\u201d) A CNN Camera man pose as a protestor until the anchor, who wasn\u2019t in on the joke, threw him under the bus) The New York times publish a glowing review of a Hillary town hall, where a little girl with a Red Ribbon in her hair commented how devastated she was at Donald Trump remarks, neglecting to mention that she was the daughter of a Democratic Congressman and major Hillary Supporter. In the NYT opinion, The little girl\u2019s question just \u201c\u2026seemed to speak to her strengths as a candidate\u201d. It did. Because it was STAGED. So now the media is claiming it\u2019s the Apocalypse, and that there is a fake news problem. There actually is, if by \u201cFake\u201d, you mean that the content is getting to people without a major media company controlling it. Boo Hoo.
