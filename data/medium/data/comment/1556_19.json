In this country, we don\u2019t have national elections. Even when electing the President and Vice President, we don\u2019t have a national election. We have 50 state elections, and the winners are determined by the Electoral College. Would a \u201cretention election\u201d for a recent Supreme Court justice be done by 50 state elections? And would the result be determined by total popular vote, or by the Electoral College, or by some other method? If we were to have some sort of national \u201cretention\u201d vote, I can easily see lots of partisanship, massive campaigns, untold amounts of money going into such campaigns, etc. I don\u2019t think this would remove the politicization of the process on a national level\u200a\u2014\u200ait would just be escalated. Yes, the Supreme Court has become divided by political ideology, and this can\u2019t be what our founding fathers had in mind. We should have nine non-partisan objective justices on the court. Not a number of Democrats and a number of Republicans where we constantly battle over balance. Something must indeed be done where we don\u2019t get justices confirmed just because they are on one extreme end of the political spectrum or the other.
