But she wouldn\u2019t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in\u00a0it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.!\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1435", "creatorid": "8ae39efb2026", "id": "813e3c4ef157"}
