The violence and \u201cHATE\u201d that was put on display here, was done by a frequent user/resident of this shelter. So what does the headline mean? Does it mean transgender people are full of hate? Does it mean transgender people have anger problems? Or does it just mean that there are some jacked up, angry people out there? It doesn\u2019t sound to me that the person who perpatrated this violence had a particular target. So again, why the headline? Oh that\u2019s right\u2026.>CLICK BAIT. Got me!!
