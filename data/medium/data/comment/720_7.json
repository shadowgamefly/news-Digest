{"name": "720_7", "child": "", "content": "Hi Greg, thanks for reading! I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. To answer your question, before conducting my usability tests, I spent some time just perusing the app and taking notes of difficulties I had. For example, since I kept unintentionally searching for flights while trying to book a hotel, I figured other users would have the same problem and decided to test that assumption. Basically, the process involves playing around with an app, identifying pain points, and developing tasks to help validate those pain points. Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Michael ", "title": "", "parent": "720", "creatorid": "be96c24a4df4", "id": "401ece94bcfe"}
