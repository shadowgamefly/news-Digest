{"name": "606_9", "child": "", "content": "Best of luck with your new venture. One thing you touched on but didn\u2019t say, despite your experiences, is that to grow past a certain point (one of the traditional standards of \u201csuccess\u201d) any venture must delegate roles and rely on others to get their job done and done right. Finding a balance between ownership and the satisfaction it brings and being another cog in the assembly line is tough, but most small ventures fail for this reason in part. Their owner or designer never lets go and lets that happen. This limits eventual growth opportunities and stagnates the business unit as well as places a ceiling on what they can achieve. This is a classic struggle for all small businesses, across all industries. If they are good and meet success, they grow. Past a certain point, no one can control or be involved in all the aspects of the business. They have to bring on the right people and trust them to do their job. But like you, I\u2019m not cut out to be a \u201cCog\u201d myself. I can relate. The balance is hard to find. ", "title": "", "parent": "606", "creatorid": "32144be86d6f", "id": "9655534abd4"}
