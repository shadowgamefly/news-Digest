Garland, the Democrat nominee, never or rarely saw a government regulation he didn\u2019t deem constitutional. By contrast, Gorsuch, the Republican nominee, is noted as quite skeptical of any such deference. For the next 8 years [OK, 4 if we are lucky, but history tells us that if voters are stupid enough to vote for a president once, they are stupid enough to vote for his re-election. Better to assume 8.] those will be Trump\u2019s regulations, and we need voices on the Court that are skeptical, not rubber stamps.
