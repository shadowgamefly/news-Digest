{"name": "117_3", "child": "", "content": "Klay has had a surprisingly mediocre season, but people only seem to notice his occasional scoring outburst. His PER is close to average at 17.57, and for all the talk of his defense, he rates as a minus defender per DRPM, even while on a top defensive team. Throw in his below average assist and rebounding rates at the SG position, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he\u2019s been more than a really good 1-dimensional player. He\u2019s a phenomenal shooter; don\u2019t get me wrong. But for all the focus on advanced metrics these days, everyone seems to ignore them when evaluating Thompson\u2019s performance this year.
