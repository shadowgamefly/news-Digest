{"name": "43_3", "child": "", "content": "You\u2019re right, OKC/GSW isn\u2019t really a rivalry by any reasonable standard. I think you\u2019re also right in pointing out that KD/Russ is definitely still a rivalry, though (and may be until the end of time at this rate). I wrote about this on my publication today, and I pretty much agree with everything you\u2019ve written here. I do think there\u2019s a chance that the Thunder could pull out a home victory against Golden State\u200a\u2014\u200aand I definitely don\u2019t think they\u2019d get swept in a playoff series\u2014but there\u2019s no chance in the world that Oklahoma City could every actually challenge the Warriors. That\u2019s kinda sad. These teams were so close last year, and now there\u2019s a gap the size of (well, Kevin Durant I guess) between them. Regardless, I\u2019ll keep waiting with bated breath for Durant\u2019s return to OKC. I honestly and truly cannot wait to see what how the fans there treat him.
