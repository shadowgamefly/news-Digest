I\u2019m sure that everyone knows that not all white people act in this way. But a great many of them do. Think of that meme that shows Kate Gosselin\u2019s haircut and says: \u201cWomen with hair like this have a 125% chance of asking to speak to the manager\u201d. It needs no explanation. You get it immediately because it\u2019s based on the very stereotype that the author points to\u200a\u2014\u200aone that is rooted in truth. It is important to learn to speak up, stand up for yourself and ask for what you deserve (something that continues as a life\u2019s journey for me). The only point on which I diverge is that that lady inconveniencing everyone else for her own desires at Chipotle is nothing to aspire to\u200a\u2014\u200afar too many people have crossed over the line from asking for what they deserve to demanding things based on an unjustified sense of entitlement, forget common courtesy. I love Mr. Leon\u2019s closing. Press yourself to speak the truth about who you are and what you\u2019ve accomplished. Ask for what you deserve. Even when it feels uncomfortable. I believe that this practice will change your life. I am working on it myself.\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "1482", "creatorid": "12f0df5814a", "id": "ea4f30ed3b5d"}
