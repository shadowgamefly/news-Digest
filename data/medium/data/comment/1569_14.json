Since Gorsuch was a big advocate for Bush/Cheney torture program, one would think, that alone would disqualify him. So how many Americans support, American Military and citizens should be tortured? What kind of moral standard is this? Right wing Christians love this guy because he\u2019ll give them anything and everything they want. Showing how morally corrupt the Christian Right is, as long as they get power. They would crucify Jesus today, because he\u2019s a foreigner and advocates mercy for the poor. Up is down and bad is good in this new world order. ", "title": "", "parent": "1569", "creatorid": "f47c012a2c84", "id": "a5bf9209c168"}
