{"content": "Lebron is the best player in the league, there\u2019s no doubt about that. But he definitely does not deserve to win the MVP this year. He played 2 or 3 more minutes a game than all those guys, has two other all stars on his team, and for all that they have the 5th best record in the league. One more loss and they\u2019re the 8th best record. The only argument for Lebron is how absolutely incompetent Kyrie is at running at offense, and his admittedly crazy counting stats which still aren\u2019t as good as Harden\u2019s or Westbrook\u2019s, despite playing a significant amount of more minutes than them. And it\u2019s not like you can argue in favor of Lebron\u2019s defense this year, he somehow managed to put in less effort than Harden.
