And the Republicans won\u2019t \u201ckeep their powder dry\u201d WRT changing the rules when the Dems try to use parliamentary tactics to slow down Trump\u2019s nominees.

Theater for the sake of theater impresses only the most deranged of the Dem base but otherwise makes them look as though they\u2019re trying to make the country ungovernable. Considering how the Republicans behaved during the Obama administration, that may seem unfair. But it\u2019s true. ", "title": "", "parent": "1570", "creatorid": "14f8f19f7d9", "id": "deb2c05812ce"}
