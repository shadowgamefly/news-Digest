I can see that you guys not only have a great sense of design, you also have the domain knowledge. This is very important in creating healthcare related software. Anything too academic or theory in term of design will be a deal breaker. One thing to keep in mind. The UI/UX that you are designing is to keep the doctor\u2019s eye on his/her patient, not the app. Nobody wants to go to a doctor that keep looking at the computer screen during the consultation(the doctor know this, and they will LOVE you if you can make an app that achieves this). Thinking from the perspective of the doctor is the key to make your app not only beautiful but GREAT. This is one of the biggest (and somehow unique)challenges when it comes to designing an app for the Doctor. If you are a designer that is trained to design an app that can keep the user eye on the screen, now you have to think differently (tips: go and observe how the doctor works). ", "name": "2412_4"}
