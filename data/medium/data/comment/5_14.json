{"name": "5_14", "child": "", "content": "People can be nasty idiots, I get that. But I have a question for you: what should I do if I see a friend genuinely endangering their health through eating? For instance: the behavior of someone I had known for 30 years clearly led top his early death: he was pathologically obese, amd developed type 2 diabetes among other obesity-related disorders. I belonged to a circle of friends who helped drive him to the hospital for hyperbaric oxygen therapy to save his foot when got a minor infection in one of his toes, we drove him to places that were just a few minutes walk from his home. The man became a genuine invalid. He was about 50 years old when he finally died of heart failure. So what do you suggest? Should the doctors have remained silent and not told him he had to lose weight? We knew how touchy he was about it\u200a\u2014\u200awere we right never to to engage him in a conversation about the habit which was killing him? And what about his son, who is also \u201cplus-sized\u201d? Would it be \u201cweight-shaming\u201d to make sure he understands the dangers of his genetic predisposition? Are we we supposed to stand idly by if our dead friend\u2019s son starts going too far down the path that led to his father\u2019s tragic death?
