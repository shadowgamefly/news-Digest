{"content": "Hi Panpan, thank you for writing this! My mother is Chinese, and I was raised in China, but with an American father, my mother was always very adamant about \u201cWest is Best\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re American, not Chinese.\u201d But, after \u201creturning\u201d to the United States about seven years ago (to go to college), I\u2019ve never been more aware of how Chinese I truly am. And through this realization, I\u2019ve been working more and more to understand where my mother came from. This was a beautifully written article that helped me better understand the country I grew up in and the people of my mother\u2019s generation who grew up during the cultural revolution and vividly remember what life was like. Thank you. ", "child": "", "parent": "5", "title": "", "creatorid": "b2e9315e568b", "name": "5_14", "id": "d3a3929cb239"}
