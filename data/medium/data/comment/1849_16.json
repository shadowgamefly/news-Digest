{"name": "1849_16", "child": "", "content": "Ah, I guess I can understand that it might be annoying to hear someone drone on about their love of reading if it isn\u2019t your passion yet I feel one might have that same feeling about someone droning on about any passion they don\u2019t find fascinating. Now, the point I disagree with you on is the idea that reading is fine. Unfortunately, too many seem to agree with you and I believe it is more than fine yet it seems we have stopped the activity quite a bit. I deal with older people, who now, can\u2019t even read a newspaper (which is sad, newspapers write at a seventh grade level) and comprehend because they quit reading years ago. Children barely read at home and their abilities to perform in school are lacking. Reading is a skill, when you stop using it, you lose the skill. Reading a book is what enables you to keep your comprehension skills alive and a book gives one the ability to have an attention span longer than 140 characters or a blog post because sometimes it takes a tad bit longer to properly lay out the facts of a situation. Of course, I enjoy holding a book but if you want to read a book on an e-reader, do it. Just read a book, any book that entices you. My Goodreads list is rather embarrassing, you will find cheesy Romance novels by Danielle Steele, old classics by F.Scott Fitzgerald, and mass market types,like, Jodi Picoult.
