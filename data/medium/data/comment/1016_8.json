{"name": "1016_8", "child": "", "content": "This is very true! I see this challenge arise all the time. I\u2019ve moved from wire framing to prototyping, because when prototyping it\u2019s much easier to show the interaction model to development, figure out more of the visuals and get in front of users to test. Maybe prototyping takes more time upfront, but overall it seems to add a lot more clarity and can still be done in an agile process. Wrongly or rightly, the teams I work on usually focus on UX one sprint ahead, which gives enough time for a quick feature based prototype!
