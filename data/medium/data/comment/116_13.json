{"id": "de0bae890f97", "content": "Interesting thoughts.\u00a0Data is changing the software industry and we should be aware of it. I used to be a classical programmer and recently I\u2019ve started doing some works using data science techniques. In fact, there are some differences between these two fields. Classical programmers usually want to build software which makes the client satisfied. On the other hand, data scientists (maybe data engineers too) want to extract knowledge from data usually to support decision making. It often requires: (i) organizing information; (ii) create hypothesis; (iii) make experiments and statistical analysis; (iv) create some regression (or classification) models to predict something; (v) and create visualization tools. My software development background helped me a lot to start in this new world. Knowing how to create tools and automate things can be useful to someone who is starting.
