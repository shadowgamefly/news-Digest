{"name": "1569_5", "child": "", "content": "If Gorsuch is \u2018too far right,\u2019 then I think the Democrats really should try to strong arm a more moderate candidate/nominee. I am conservative by temperament, so I don\u2019t see it that way. I am willing to accept the conclusion from the other side that Gorsuch is a step too far. What I outright reject is Milihiser\u2019s weak logic. Implied in Milihiser\u2019s position is the stance that only Republicans pull the old double-cross, and that any show of compromise by Democrats is treated as weak capitulation and an absence of resolve. Of course, it is nonsensical, and a bit juvenile, to subscribe to a strategic position on the grounds that \u201cwell, he started it,\u201d but that is exactly what Ian is proposing here, and why he has a remarkable proclivity for being wrong about everything. (I actually think we need progressive minds to balance and serve as an antidote to the fools on the right. Milihiser\u2019s rationale always strikes me as exactly the reason that Trump has been able to cobble together enough votes to win.) Because I think it is one of our most pressing problems, and because it has been exacerbated by the Democratic old double cross, I will reference immigration, and how underhandedness by Dems has helped to keep our immigration problem alive and malignant. Thirty years ago, Reagan agreed to amnesty in return for a secure border. Millions were free to stay with few complications, but the Dems reneged on the promise to secure the border. That act ensured that we would ultimately get to where we are now, as one GOP legislator after another has been afraid to make any concessions on immigration. Why is any form of amnesty or path to citizenship a deal breaker? Because, well, the Dems started it. Sounds stupid in that case too.
