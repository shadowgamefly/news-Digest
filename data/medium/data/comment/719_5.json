I think, for example, of the legal review on my team. I don\u2019t read contracts or negotiations with a legal/regulatory eye, because I know we have a dedicated person with that responsibility. The same logic flows for UX: if it\u2019s a universal responsibility, no one person should be \u201ctitled\u201d with it explicitly.
