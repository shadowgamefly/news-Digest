{"name": "805_16", "child": "", "content": "Clifford, I have had this article open in my browser for four days now. Despite already reading it from start to finish, I keep coming back to read bits of it again and take notes. You have really helped me clarify my thinking and, on a personal level, your (authentic) approach really resonates with me. You have touched on some of the most classic pain points of early-stage SaaS growth. Please keep writing. I promise I\u2019ll keep reading and I\u2019ll also start sharing stories from our own experience. Thanks again, Omer ", "title": "", "parent": "805", "creatorid": "52c534a25db1", "id": "a47f96cf5189"}
