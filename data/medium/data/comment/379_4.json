I was concerned this piece might come off as criticizing or shaming or insulting BDSM or kink or as if it\u2019s an opinion on \u201cdifferent sexual practices.\u201d I really don\u2019t have an opinion on what consenting adults do and think there is a lot of room for play/imagination in sex, etc. My intention with this piece was much more on what happens when we hide behind the characters and play and what are we hiding from? And when we believe we are so \u201cfree\u201d with no attachments actually we are less free because we have to stay contained emotionally, not make any demands on the other person, not to cross emotional barriers. It seems these casual relationships masquerade as being freeing but actually confine us to smaller boxes than if we could give and take everything, good and bad. I\u2019m so glad that it came through for you and I am happy you enjoyed it!\u200a\u2014\u200aKitten ", "title": "", "parent": "379", "creatorid": "db8b498ee60f", "id": "6b47db2f9c9d"}
