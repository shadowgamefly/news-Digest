{"name": "423_10", "child": "", "content": "This is a tough one Jessi. As you know, from your last article on Uber, I agree that Kalanick ought to go. But, as a startup founder and advocate, I also want to see founders maintain the ability to control their companies. And I applaud those who make it happen (in most cases over the arguments of their investors). The tenor of this piece seems like Kalanick bad = super-votes bad. However I think the two in this case are just coincidentally connected. If Travis knew what was best for his company, he\u2019d step aside and run things from the boardroom. Whether through votes or common sense and agreement, getting a CEO out has repercussions that no one can predict. But doing it forcibly (like via a board ouster) is rarely good.
