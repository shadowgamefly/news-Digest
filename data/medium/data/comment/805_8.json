The ones that brag about getting some stupidly obscene amount of signups/customers/sales for seemingly little or no effort or just by using this \u201cone trick\u201d? You betcha. 100%. The ones that throw \u201cteasers\u201d out at their audiences that are basically along the lines of \u201cWell, if you knew about my secret approach to blah blah blah, you\u2019d be getting awesome results like this too! Just sign up for my limited seat webinar NOW before it sells out!\u201d Yeah. Them too. The ones that brag about how they\u2019re #1 in Google and how much business it brings them and if you just paid them for what they knew, you could be too? Sure. Or how about the ones that humblebrag about how they don\u2019t have to do hardly any work at their online business and spend all of their time rotating between their five houses around the world or that they made $4 million last year in their pajamas? Yeah, fuck them too. And let\u2019s not forget the numerous startups out there pandering this type of shit (\u201cWe built our startup with no advertising, no marketing, no sales, no nothing! We just put it online and it went viral!\u201d) just to get PR and signups from people who want to \u201cbe like them\u201d or because of the word of mouth it created. You can build a legit audience, add value, and even ask them to buy stuff you make. Nothing wrong with that. That doesn\u2019t offend me. So long as you\u2019re honest and transparent about it, deliver the goods, and you make sure it actually gives your audience the results you promised them. The problem is there are far too many people out there getting everyone\u2019s attention with these crazy build a startup/info product/freelancing business and get rich quick without doing any real work messages. Or, they admit there\u2019s some work, but they\u2019ll only tell you about it if you fork over big money for it. They\u2019re all over social media, all over search results. People that legitimately want to build a business get sucked into their fantastic story full of shiny baubles, spend shit tons of time and money doing things that don\u2019t work and give up, feeling bad about themselves. \u201cIt must be me. After all, it worked for that expert and he\u2019s living the life, right?\u201d Meanwhile, the audience builder is laughing his ass off all the way to the bank. So yeah. I\u2019m calling bullshit on all those motherfuckers. Sorry if that offends you. ", "title": "", "parent": "805", "creatorid": "55e9fd9a459", "id": "14151692c45d"}
