{"name": "1053_13", "child": "", "content": "It took a LONG time, but I finally found a company that interviewed in a thorough yet smart, fair, and fun way: a reasonable, real-life-problem-oriented take-home initial coding assignment that was not timed or forced; discussion of the assignment at an onsite interview; brainstorm-style discussion of some real-work problems the company faces on a whiteboard at the onsite as well (design ideas, NOT complex coding on a whiteboard, which I find pointless and intimidating); more meetings and lunch with the team at the onsite in a relaxed atmosphere. Suffice it to say, I landed the job and, though it\u2019s still early days, am quite happy there. If only more companies would adopt these practices it would go a long way toward curing what ails the hiring pipeline in tech.
