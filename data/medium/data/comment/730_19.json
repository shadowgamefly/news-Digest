No brand requirements, no product design restrictions, no insider information that would shackle ideas. No \u201cthis is the way we\u2019ve always done it\u201d debt, just pure exploration. Someone did an unsolicited redesign of my company and our team loved it. (https://dribbble.com/shots/2876030-Stackoverflow-redesign if you\u2019re interested) In fact, my company does an exercise we call 5% fun that has similar rules: throw out all constraints and just design something different. Do we ever ship these designs? Absolutely not. Do we ever ship parts of these designs? You bet. Did we get ideas from the fellow who redesigned our site above? Absolutely. Ideas come from everywhere: analytics, user research, established design patterns\u2026 and design explorations like this. If you\u2019re tired of seeing these pop up in your feed, take some time to adjust your feed instead of writing things that put other people down. On the outside chance you\u2019re interested in why I like and actively use other people\u2019s unsolicited redesigns in my own paid product design work, I wrote about it: https://medium.com/@tedgoas/an-open-letter-to-designers-of-unsolicited-redesigns-and-unbuildable-apps-44048ba16b76 ", "title": "", "parent": "730", "creatorid": "7f9564a00a5c", "id": "89e71c07d08c"}
