Everyone cannot win, once you open the borders to \u201ceveryone\u201d you lose your country, your culture and all of the good things you fled to escape in the the old country. You bring \u201cthere\u201d here. Nature is harsh. For everyone of \u201cyou\u201d that come from some other country, you take away the chance for a better life from someone born in Canada that is struggling to get ahead in Canada. True courage would be to stay and fight for your country, not run and steal someone else\u2019s birthright. The strong survive and the weak perish. That\u2019s a fact and any society that fails to heed nature\u2019s strong reality is doomed to perish. Open boarder will never work in the long run. There must be winners and losers. You cannot rise the level of everyone, you can only diminish the hopes of all and distribute misery. Yashar is a winner, but who did he crush in his quest for the top?
