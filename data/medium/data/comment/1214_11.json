{"name": "1214_11", "child": "", "content": "One of my favorite things about your writing is the way you put your moments out like pieces of a puzzle. Your sentences always latch to each other gently and without friction; I\u2019ll realize I love one sentence, not just because of how it rings on its own, but because of how it answers the one behind it, and meanders to the heart of the one in front of it. I can hear the padded clicking of your nuance as I read. Thank you so much for this, Aura! ", "title": "", "parent": "1214", "creatorid": "1a63cf04da58", "id": "c56135ad6dbb"}
