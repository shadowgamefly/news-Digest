{"name": "706_15", "child": "", "content": "Webflow is the closest, I would agree. The thing though is that most designers, and that is I would say around 80\u201390%, would not touch webflow to \"design\" because it requires to have some understanding of frontend development. In fact, with Sketchs move into reusable components it allows a designer to actually stay within their world (read: not knowing about floats, the box model etc) but actually still being close to actual implemenation. It may not look as close to actual implementation as Webflow does, but perhaps that is actually the way to go? I would argue though that knowledge about technical implementation would hinter a designer to come up with new creative ways to a design problem. Depending on the team and project setup, it might though be crucial to actually know about those technicalities to go from design into code as smoothly as possible.
