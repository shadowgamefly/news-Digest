{"id": "40ac96fce525", "content": "Thanks for the Artcile. I liked many parts of your article but it looks to me like your were quite biased in your description of what a Data Engineer does. Examples: ETLs are important, but lately streaming and near-realtime solutions are necessary.Emphasis on BI: Some Data Engineers don\u2019t come from a BI background, but rather software engineer or even ML and Data Science, sometimes because the company / business require them to do.SQL Mastery and Denormalization: I agree that SQL and Denormalization are important skills to have, but that depends of the type of data your company needs to work with. In my case, I do ETLs, but generally on scrapped data from the web. SQL is usually mostly to dump stuff on HDFS or write Hive queries.Architecture: I do believe this is important, but There is already a job that does that, some people call it Big Data Architect. Additionally some Data Engineers, might go even to use Machine Learning directly or become part of a Data Science team supporting but sometimes working in more prediction related task. Some people believe the right Data Science team, comes from mixing good engineering skills (Data Engineer) with good Machine Learning skills (Data Scientist).
