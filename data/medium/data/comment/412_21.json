{"name": "412_21", "child": "", "content": "Great analysis Abhishek! Though, i\u2019m finding it difficult to understand how is Zomato v/s Swiggy story in conflict with Aggregation Theory. Zomato couldn\u2019t control distrubution/delivery and thus ended up providing a sub-par user experience in comparison to Swiggy on the most important metric that mattered to customers: Time to delivery. Thus, Swiggy aggregated customers and suppliers around the choke point of food delivery business, whereas Zomato aggregated customers and suppliers around just the discovery of interesting restaurants.
