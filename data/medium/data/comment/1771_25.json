In protracted conversations with Alvin about demassification issue was, as you say, \u201cbuilding new infrastructures for connection where people have a purpose.\u201d Those haven\u2019t been built. But, when you say, \u201cIf we want to develop a healthy democracy, we need a diverse and highly connected social fabric,\u201d you neglect to note we don\u2019t have a democracy\u200a\u2014\u200aindeed most believe its a medieval plutocracy. (see my, Doc Says\u200a\u2014\u200aOur Emotions, Institutions and Technological Capabilities Are Mismatched, Civilization\u2019s Anti-Human, Not Machines and or Our Twilight Zone & What Comes Next *) When you say, \u201cAmerican public wants to have strong connections across divisions. They see the value politically and socially. But they\u2019re not going to work for it\u2026.This is the conundrum we now face,\u201d you are spot on.
