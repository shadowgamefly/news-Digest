{"name": "1885_7", "child": "", "content": "Counterpoint: Do you really want to be the people getting treated differently because of your race? That is still discrimination. If my product/idea can\u2019t stand on its own merits without my race coming in then it\u2019s obviously not ready. If my community isn\u2019t applying then there\u2019s obviously a grassroots issue. I don\u2019t think this solves anything except encourages a form of more socially acceptable discrimination, and discrimination, the word itself, really is contextual. Maybe I\u2019m not American enough but it blows my mind that people would WANT special treatment for their race, I\u2019d feel slighted as hell, but luckily I\u2019m not begging for money either because I can\u2019t run a business then I\u2019ll go figure that out myself. I can\u2019t be the only person who thinks it\u2019s counterproductive and frankly insane, can I? I don\u2019t care about your race, and if people do, well, don\u2019t fucking tell them, make your passthrough entities and don\u2019t ask for money, you shouldn\u2019t need to because dev budgeting should be the center of your whole project\u2019s planning anyway.
