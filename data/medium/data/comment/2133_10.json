I\u2019m glad your depression is gone and you are just experiencing the sad but normal up\u2019s and down\u2019s that life throws at us now. I hope your depression never returns. Thank you for pointing out that everyone feels depressed but depression (clinical) is an illness not a feeling. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. Please, never feel by sharing your story that you are diminishing another\u2019s story or that one persons issues matter more than anothers. It\u2019s all relevant. We all matter\u00a0:)) Talking openly about Mental Health is important and I am thankful for people like yourself who are able to! Maybe one day there won\u2019t be a stigma attached to the terms \u2018Mental Health.\u2019 Thanks again! ", "name": "2133_10", "id": "183b7deeca39"}
