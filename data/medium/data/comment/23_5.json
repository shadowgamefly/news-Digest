{"id": "33ee6b551910", "content": "Thanks Sean for this very interesting, well-written piece. It surely looks like a work of weeks, if not months! I\u2019m very fascinated by the different approaches towards theaters chosen by Amazon and Netflix\u00a0respectively. It appears to me as if Netflix seems driven to upend/disrupt the status-quo in a more radical fashion, while Amazon is more willing to play ball with the broader movie ecosystem. Is that how you perceive it as well? The\u00a0creative\u00a0freedom\u00a0the streamers\u00a0give\u00a0artists\u00a0is\u00a0inherent\u00a0to\u00a0their subscription\u00a0business\u00a0model. At the box office, you need to be concerned about marketability and such\u00a0because\u00a0you\u00a0make\u00a0money\u00a0from\u00a0selling\u00a0tickets\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0movie. In streaming, as you make your money from users over time, the individual titles in your library don\u2019t matter nearly as much. Here, the purpose of the content is merely to attract new users and secure loyalty among existing one\u2019s. Building a content portfolio optimized to increase your customers' lifetime value, not individual sales, is certainly a new skill to master for movie buyers and producers. I assume it means, among other things, more very special, niche content. Which would benefit indie movie makers. Also, we need to keep in mind that those who run the show at Netflix and Amazon are new to this\u200a\u2014after all it\u2019s unprecedented in the movie industry. So, please keep us posted on how this story evolves\u00a0\u263a ", "creatorid": "20c9bca8bd6b", "title": "", "parent": "23", "child": "", "name": "23_5"}
