Long before the internet existed, the same problem occurred only it was much worse (look up\u201cpayola\u201d on a search engine). I\u2019m not confusing anything with anything. I\u2019m saying exactly this. That people are paying the distributor and not for the product. I think I made that quite clear. Today, it\u2019s actually easier to get paid directly for your work. I\u2019m a \u201ccreative\u201d and I do it all the time. And I damn sure don\u2019t charge 10 cents for something that took me an hour (or more!) to create. I can\u2019t speak for Drake or whomever, but most famous musicians make most of their money on concerts and merchandise, not streams and royalties. Why? Because their customers aren\u2019t paying the distributor. The ONLY reason to have a distributor is to increase \u201cbrand awareness\u201d, not to make money (directly). Yes it is easier. But it\u2019s a fuck tonne harder to get paid at volume, to get paid over a long period of time, and to find exposure to any audience who wants to pay. Also\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s an awful lot harder for a writer or an artist to get paid for playing concerts. And even if they did, they\u2019re still not being paid for their creative work, they\u2019re being paid for their personal appearance and that\u2019s not the same thing. Also, quit complaining about being criticized. If people went to all the trouble to write you and call you a \u201csell out\u201d then at least they care. Far worse to be ignored. If you want to tell me to quit complaining, you can find somebody else\u2019s blog to comment on. ", "creatorid": "5ce28105ffbc", "name": "2029_15", "parent": "2029"}
