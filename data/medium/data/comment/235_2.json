{"name": "235_2", "child": "", "content": "Things that bring me\u00a0joy: Peace. The definition of it should truly explain why it\u2019s something I enjoy experiencing and keeps me happy and uplifted. Family. They can be a pain, but ultimately, they keep me on my toes, focused, accountable, and reminded that I am stronger than I believe. Friends. I can go on and on about my loved ones, those deeply connected to me. Every time I think of them, I smile. Jernee. Having a pet as a companion, one who helps me from day to day to maintain my cool and feel exceptionally loved when I may sink into a funk. Silent/Quiet Time: Each night, I grant myself time alone to just sit in peace or read, write, and enjoy the silence around me. It does wonders for my soul after a long, busy day. Music: I can get lost in the beauty that is music. There\u2019s truly nothing greater than sitting back and allowing melodies, harmonies, and my favorite artists/vocalists take me to places I have never been simply with music.
