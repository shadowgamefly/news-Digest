{"name": "415_12", "child": "", "content": "Another job killed by Amazon. Maybe flying over rural areas where people can shoot them out of the sky or just hack the code and have all packages directed to land on their landing pad would stop this nonsense. How many birds have died trying to avoid a drone? Bezos make think it\u2019s cool but this seems like a fool\u2019s errand. How many Uber drivers does it take to clog up all the major cities in the world and by the same token, how many drones will be annoying home dwellers buzzing in the sky because some idiot forgot sunblock. Obesity is caused by millions of people too lazy to get off their @sses and go to the store or plan properly to get somewhere on time. The \u201cconvenience\u201d of getting packages anywhere,anytime, is that just like every 3rd car is likely an Uber driver-the drones will fill up our skies and landing on a landing pad with no one to sign for and take in their home just invites theives to sit and wait for deliveries to come when they know people are not at home. How many millions of dollars of products are stolen from people\u2019s front door with a real person delivering and how much does Bezos think this is going up when a drone that doesn\u2019t notice a car that normally isn\u2019t parked in the neighborhood waits for his precious cargo to be airdropped into their laps? Idiotic idea and if it gets off the ground, I expect some packages will disappear and the neighbors of frequent users of this service will complain of noise from drone deliveries. Convenience for some and constant annoyance to thousands of others. Bad idea. Make sure someone has to sign for valuable packages or become the target of street smart thieves who knows who is getting cool stuff delivered!
