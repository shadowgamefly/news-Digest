Yes, we can suffice with our other animals, but there is a difference. People need people and once we accept that and use AI as a tool not a replacement, we will be getting somewhere. There are people out here still interacting and helping one another. It may just be a smile or even an interaction of not being cruel. But it still exists because we need it. It is a part of who we are as human beings. Crises and preparation has taught us that human beings still have compassion. This ability to put aside differences and work together to provide for something or someone other than ourselves is human. It is good for our health both physically and emotionally. The interactive behavior can make a difference in our life. CPR & Behavioral health is where it is at for me. Take the time to interact and actually connect with people. Be aware in this interaction. It is time to appreciate our humanity. ", "creatorid": "48eeb4a1bea9", "title": "", "parent": "81", "child": "", "name": "81_20"}
