{"name": "27_9", "child": "", "content": "The \u201cThunder box out for Russ to grab boards\u201d is such a dumb, lazy narrative. 1) Have you seen Russ rebound? Maybe you\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s kind of athletic. 2) The Fuck you turning boxing out into a conspiratorial crime? Ask Oregon about boxing out. Ask every 5th grade, junior high, or high school coach about boxing out. It\u2019s almost as lazy and dumb as \u201cOscar was 3rd in MVP voting his triple double year.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, is the game\u2019s best defensive center in history and 11-time champion in the league this year? No? Maybe there's a 7'4\" freak averaging 50/20? No? Then kindly shut your cock-holster. Thx ", "title": "", "parent": "27", "creatorid": "fa8a8679f8b5", "id": "a0df62de4872"}
