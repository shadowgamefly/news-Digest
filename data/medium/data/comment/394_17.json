{"name": "394_17", "child": "", "content": "I completely disagree with your alt-college suggestion, but I was interested in the comments and only after reading all of them did I decide to toss my ideas in, largely because I found a question missing from the discussion: What is the point of college? The curricula presented here is one answer, there are some among the comments that state what they got or didn\u2019t get out of college. Off the top of my head, I believe college offers validation, freedom, growth. Validation is from a perspective employer, a graduate is capable and has potential. How well you do with your grades, skills, and other CV level endeavors will help with getting an interview. Freedom, for most this is the first experience with freedom and the benefits and responsibilities that come along for the ride. I am talking about the ones who actually go to college and don\u2019t commute from home like they did in high school. Growth, is being in a very diverse mix of people that are all part of your community. Making connections and navigating the interpersonal relationships to the ideas and attitudes of a mix of people, for better or worse you will never likely be surrounded by again. This is all done in a relatively safe environment that fosters the option for any student to put in as much or as little with the guarantee the more they put in, the more they will get back. And yes, it has gotten way too expensive. And yes, I wish everyone could experience college at some point in their life because as stated, some people need some time after high school to travel or experience the real world first.
