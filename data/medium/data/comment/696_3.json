In a small group, both those hats may be worn by a single person. Saying I\u2019m a \u201cUX Developer\u201d means I can build as well as design. But, like you said, every developer should care about the user experience even if that user experience is only the API to a service they write or the signatures of their library methods. In a good organization, there shouldn\u2019t be some firewall outside of which your products are \u201cusable\u201d and inside of which your work products are obtuse and difficult to use crap. That\u2019s a sure path to self-destruction. ", "title": "", "parent": "696", "creatorid": "824208f6e22e", "id": "9790250c1bb8"}
