I bet you will see why Hayek\u2019s vision makes perfect sense in our society: no constant user trackingno data leakageno privacy invasionbattery life: +2 yearsno software upgradesno distractionsassembled in Europenot a second spent looking at a tiny screen just because it\u2019s geekier than looking at a smartphoneit tells the timeit\u2019s a contact-less payment system that allows me to pay at any VISA enabled terminalthe watch does only a few things but it does them well, and they integrate so well that you end up ignoring their mere existence Google and Apple are centuries away from this concept. Their business model is to create an \u201call-in-one device\u201d that captures as much of both your attention and your data in order to 1) deny other companies access to your attention 2) resell information about you. Their watches are basically an extension to grasp the \u201clast mile\u201d of our lives our phones have been denied access to: continuous and uninterrupted access to our biological status. If Hayek can offer me a simple, sane and elegant solution to benefit from both worlds (the beauty and elegance of a timepiece and the usefulness of the technology embedded in it), then I am all for it. Most people who criticize this vision and bet on its demise can only quote Google and Apple as \u201cexamples\u201d to support their opinion, I think this is the actual symptom we should investigate: why and how have so many people become so blind to the point they can\u2019t appreciate innovation anymore unless it caries the logo of a bitten apple? Hopefully, I am not the only one waiting for this.
