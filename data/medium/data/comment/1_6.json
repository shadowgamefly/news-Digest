{"id": "fa9c622a51e3", "content": "Whether it\u2019s competitive or additive depends on the (job title) designer\u2019s mindset. Some designers crave control and want to be \u201cthe hero\u201d who solves the problem. They want to go in hiding, build their exact vision then show it to an impressed audience of colleagues. I know, because that was me, 5 years ago. Then I learned (the hard way) that different people with diverse vantage points can help create drastically better experiences and products. That a designer with no buy-in from others in the organization can\u2019t get much done anyway. I learned to focus on being an effective co-maker of products instead of a trying to be a \u201ccreative genius\u201d. That tapping into collective smarts is a big part of my job, more than coming up with cool ideas (thanks for the lesson, Jake Knapp ) In a way, being an effective designer is like being a guerilla revolutionary: you have to convince and engage as many people as you can to fight for the cause of great user experiences. That\u2019s how change happens. Otherwise, you\u2019re just a bunch of fanatics with weird ideas, hiding in the woods, going nowhere.
