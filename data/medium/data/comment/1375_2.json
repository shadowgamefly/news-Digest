{"name": "1375_2", "child": "", "content": "Thanks Doc Huston for taking time to respond. I enjoyed your story on post-truth. Clearly you\u2019ve spent a lot of time considering this area. There certainly seems truth in the explosion of independent media outlet propelling the current political wave. What the future holds is less certain. It sounds like you also have some skin in the game with the knowledge database that you\u2019ve referenced across a number of your stories. A worthwhile project and a challenging one in a number of aspects. The aspect I find most interesting being trust. Assuming you can develop the ever updating content, building trust from the consumers will be vital, and difficult. Then maintaining that trust even more so. I\u2019d be keen to understand how you plan to overcome it, if that\u2019s something you\u2019re willing to share / have written about. In any case I wish you luck with it.
