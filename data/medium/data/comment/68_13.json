Rose is a legit asset with his expiring contract as we approach the trade deadline and KP keeps getting better by the minute. As a Boston fan, I\u2019d give up the entire team just to have him. Hell, I\u2019d accept the entire organization too as long as Boston got KP. ", "title": "", "parent": "68", "creatorid": "a5e303b24518", "id": "1107e42182d3"}
