{"name": "869_20", "child": "", "content": "You spend a great deal of time making claims about Pepsi and about Kendall Jenner and announcing their thoughts and motives without knowing anything at all about what anyone is/was thinking. BTW\u200a\u2014\u200aI think you are justified in claiming that Jenner and Pepsi had profits in mind: that is what ad campaigns always care about. Also, I don\u2019t personally care a whit about the personality or the beverage company. The overwhelming momentum in US society is toward directing great scrutiny toward any incident that involves potential overreach by law enforcement. Consequently, the most likely explanation for the misjudgment by Pepsi and Jenner is exactly the opposite of your contention. They were so interested in projecting a message about universal care and respect, in a currently and unhealtily polarized society, that they completely misread the reaction to an ad that tries to mitigate the anxiety that people (all of them) feel toward police, and the anxiety that police feel toward even innocuous interactions with the public. I completely understand the anger about the ad, but I do not see monsters behind it. I simply do not believe that MOST people condone callous treatment of any group. I don\u2019t agree that Black Lives are devalued by the people, while I will certainly acknowledge that we have destructive biases that are undermining the treatment of people of color. In short, jumping to the conclusion that most people don\u2019t care is dubious in accuracy and destructive in its intent.
