Everyone knew this team was any good and when they traded Gibson and Mcdermott for a D-league PG it looked as if they were just giving up on the season. Wade probably could have resulted in at least a late first round pick if not a decent young player (maybe from the Nuggets or Bucks who were apparently interested in the offseason). I also see the trade value of Butler going down as people are starting to question his leadership and he hasnt finished the season very strong. Bad season for the bulls both in actual play and managing for the future. ", "creatorid": "22ad4a0bd7d7", "name": "1923_4", "parent": "1923"}
