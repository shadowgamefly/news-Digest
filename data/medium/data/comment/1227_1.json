{"name": "1227_1", "child": "", "content": "Connection is\u00a0Gravity Gravity is the force of attraction between any two or more bodies. Gravity is always acting on us. It\u2019s such a strong force that it can work over great distances. The sun\u2019s gravitational pull keeps all of the celestial bodies in our galaxy where they ought to be. Earth\u2019s gravity keeps us planted firmly to it. The moon\u2019s gravity pulls the seas and creates our ever constant (and predictable) tides. Every entity in the solar system large and small is in perpetual motion and their gravitational pull affects every other body. It\u2019s a never ending dance played out in the vastness of space. So it is with us. Some of our connections are powerful enough to ground us others aren\u2019t as forceful, but no less palpable. The person who consistently leaves comments on your writing. The guy you dated for six months two years ago, the guy you get a bagel from every morning, your mother. All of these and infinitely more people are the celestial bodies floating through the galaxy of our life. The trick is to know which among these connections are our sun and moon, who are the inspirational comets, and who might be the black holes.
