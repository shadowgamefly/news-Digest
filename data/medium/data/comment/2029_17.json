There is now so much cognitive content available as the product of so many professions that the value of any unit is absolutely minimal. Unless you can provide something that regularly fulfils a client\u2019s unique need that they cannot easily solve from an online database then they will, instead of paying you xx.xx per hour, spend one minute online and download or read what it is they need. I went from risky prospects in academia to a craft trade in which I provide something artisan and uniquely physical while applying my creative and problem solving abilities to a variety of individual practical problems. I resource the free cognitive commons as a tool, converting knowledge to client\u2019s well served. Here I get to use my abilities learned as an academic but my trade is nameless. Job satisfaction is no longer for me about progressing in a defined role by leveraging scalability but being adaptable and quick and meeting any challenge with my full range of skills. That is probably the only way we can realistically meet the problem of mass information availability. ", "creatorid": "8a055c851d0c", "name": "2029_17", "parent": "2029"}
