And when the Dems threatened to go nuclear back in the day, the Rs acted like it was treason. \u201cThe President has the right to pick who he wants\u201d only applies to Republican presidents, apparently. They certainly felt no compunction about not even allowing Merrick Garland an up-or-down vote for the last eleven months of President Obama\u2019s second term, and vowed to block any nominations by Hilary Clinton had she won the election. As always, It\u2019s ONLY Okay If You\u2019re A Republican. I spit on these treacherous bastards, especially fucking Mitch McConnell, that hypocritical sack of shit. I hope that the next time Mitch drives over one of the crumbling bridges that he refused to allow Obama\u2019s infrastructure plan to be rebuilt safely, the whole damn thing falls into the river. And speaking of hypocrisy and infrastructure, are the Rs going to okay trump\u2019s trillion-dollar infrastructure program, even though they refused to allow Obama\u2019s less expensive version? Is there a stronger word than hypocrite, because that barely describes these lying, asshole Republicans? ", "title": "", "parent": "1560", "creatorid": "90c48503a8b9", "id": "b101480b54cb"}
