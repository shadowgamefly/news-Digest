Considering that he could have gone to Twitter and after the lockup period joined Facebook, or done something else, this seems to be a reprehensible choice. I\u2019ll note that I just bought the book. This post peaked my curiosity too much to resist. I want to read the story, even if I consider some of the author's choices odious. I\u2019ve also read stories by degenerate drug addicts who stole from all of their friends and their family. I don\u2019t approve of their choices either. Paying to read someone\u2019s story does not mean that you condone their actions. ", "title": "", "parent": "604", "creatorid": "7093ff1752fc", "id": "2fc0ccce30b1"}
