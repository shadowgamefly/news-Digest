{"name": "1772_6", "child": "", "content": "I find it highly ironic to see people lament fake news, the attention economy and the destructive emphasis on experience while nevertheless accepting it as a self-evident truth that \u201ceveryone has been obsessed with fake news\u201d. That has not been my experience. Instead what I saw was that the same loud group of people who were locked in the bliss of pre-election Hillary triumphalism went through narrative after narrative point in a coordinated fashion post-election. It was very obvious they were all amplifying the same narrow set of ideas on the same schedule, from the same sources. An epidemic of right-wing hate crimes (many of which now turn out to be fake)\u2026 blind dimissals of angry white men (a tired refrain used to discredit, even when they\u2019re not men and not white)\u2026 fake news (from outlets who excel at clickbait)\u2026 Russian hacking to discredit American sovereinty (ignoring the war trumpets and self-justifications of past US acts, foreign and domestic). Far from representing a diversity of ideas from a more critical audience, they were guilty of exactly the same narrow-minded wag-the-dog style echo chamber they decried in their political opponents. The highlight being an NPR story about how the \u201crational\u201d left is immune to much of the media manipulation they decry in their political opponents, blissfully unaware of how they look to others. If you want to address those structural issues, best to remote the beam from one\u2019s own eye before decrying the splinter in the other fellow\u2019s.
