My company did some research on data engineers based off of their self identified skills and experience as well as job posting data from around the web. There are only 6,500 people who call themselves data engineers in the world, but there are over 6,600 job openings for data engineers in San Francisco alone. There\u2019s a lot more information in our report on things like the skills of data engineers, how they compare to data scientists and generalist software engineers, and which companies employ the most data data engineers. I\u2019d love to hear any feedback you have on it: https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/reports/the-state-of-data-engineering/ ", "creatorid": "312cd696706c", "title": "", "parent": "116", "child": "", "name": "116_2"}
