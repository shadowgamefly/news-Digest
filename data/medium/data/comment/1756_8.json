Some I own on CD, others on vinyl, one or two on C90 recorded via tape-to-tape. These days i mainly access them via Spotify (well, you try finding a decent quality tape-deck in 2017).

Like everything else about the streaming economy, only time will tell. ", "title": "", "parent": "1756", "creatorid": "d6bbe40d3bc7", "id": "fdb959cac636"}
