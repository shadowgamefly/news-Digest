{"name": "241_15", "child": "", "content": "In 2014, according to ESPN\u2019s recruiting rankings, Jackson was #8, Pinson #10 and Berry #17. Meanwhile, Stanley Johnson was #7, KAT #9, Kelly Oubre #11, Justice Winslow #15 and Devin Booker #17. My question, essentially, is how is Roy, to his benefit, able to get kids so highly ranked but not elite enough to be one and dones? Is he actually trying to recruit top players who don\u2019t exactly have NBA measureables? That seems hard to do, considering Oubre was 6'7 190 and Pinson was 6'6 190. Does Roy tell the kids who commit they have to stay at least 2 years and that drives the uber elite kids away? I mean, how did he get Harrison Barnes to stay two years? Ended up hurting his draft stock. Maybe its just that the very elite prospects don\u2019t wanna go there and he\u2019s able to get other highly ranked kids that fall through the cracks somewhat because they are UNC after all. It definitely is interesting tho. Generally, I feel like when people think of UNC, they think of NBA greatness ala Michael and Worthy then not-as-good but star caliber players\u200a\u2014\u200aJamison, Vince, Stackhouse, etc. Do they have a college football comparison?
