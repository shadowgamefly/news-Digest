{"name": "228_4", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for this. These are good reminders, especially as my wonderful, but curmudgeonly, boyfriend and I will be moving in together next year. Occasionally, when he\u2019s being particularly pessimistic or anxious, it is difficult to keep in mind what initially drew me to him. I\u2019m sure he could say the same about me when I am obnoxiously bubbly and happy. And it\u2019s very true that I cannot change him, nor can he change me. So in spite of our personality differences or, perhaps because of the differences, we adore one another and have a strong, loving relationship. I am very fortunate. \u2764 ", "title": "", "parent": "228", "creatorid": "16c7fa099513", "id": "ce4f52e74c8b"}
