{"name": "706_13", "child": "", "content": "Thanks, Mark. That is actually what I am envisioing (not to say that the industry has no challenges to overcome). In terms of collaboration tools, I think that those tools will still be used for the next months to year(s). But thinking about such tools still leaves the strong feeling that those are really just an intermediate step towards a much tighter integration between design and code. The format is not perfect as of now as people above pointed out rightfully. Now, I would argue that it is not far-fetched to imagine that Sketch will further improve the delivery format so that any\u00a0.sketch can be treated as any other plain text file. Take UI testing which is currently quite an effort to set up. If the format matures, I can imagine awesome Saas tools that make UI testing possible even for smaller projects (which oftentimes is only economic for bigger ones). Imagine an iOS engineer who could simply run a commend to have the interface builder replicate the\u00a0.sketch UI. The engineer would then start with integration and push back required changes for the UI. It is hard to come up with the myriad of possibilities that the industry will have once that happens. Though, I am sure it will be exciting. ", "title": "", "parent": "706", "creatorid": "d945233f1628", "id": "9bd6615dbee1"}
