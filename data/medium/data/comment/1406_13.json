I didn\u2019t realize most writers put per word, I put $3 as a total amt per article, thinking this was really low balling it. Turns out, I may have said too much. I am not a paid writer on Medium but it seems some have reached that status\u200a\u2014\u200ahooray for them. They are even more prolific than one could imagine, writing 2\u20134 articles a day! And they write articles and essays, not fiction like me (I didn\u2019t see anyone in that genre, but maybe I\u2019m wrong). I\u2019ll keep writing regardless. I don\u2019t write here with the expectation of money, I write because I have to\u200a\u2014\u200akinda\u2019 like you, eh? We write because we write. It makes us who we are.
