A great adventure for you Shaunta, I shall follow your new pub to track and support your progress. The challenge of a very short story is compression. You have little time to introduce plot and characters before it\u2019s time to make a point that\u2019s ironic, funny, introspective\u00a0.. or at the very least, interesting. I find that poses a huge set of challenges for developing writers, especially those, like me, who are still working on their 7 deadly sins (give or take). Add the important constraint of diminishing web-based attention spans (cue Medium\u2019s 3-minute read meme), and a writer truly has their work cut out. But gosh, flip all that around. How wonderful would it be if we could learn to craft literary morsels\u00a0\u2026 powerful, high-quality, bite-sized short stories\u00a0\u2026 delivered here on Medium\u00a0!? I love a challenge, but the fence is tall on this one. Perhaps it\u2019s a fence meant to be climbed? This is my 100wpd challenge #28.
