My ridgeback had her hind legs go out last summer and she was getting soars on her body because she couldn\u2019t use her back legs anymore. It was gut wrenching to watch her drag her back legs by moving her front legs to get around. I ended up having to put her down per the vet\u2019s suggestion since I didn\u2019t think there was anything else I could do to help her. Thank you for giving pet owners the option to not have to euthanize and giving families a chance to have a great life and continue living and loving their owners. Thank you so much! May others be blessed by the services you provide. THANK YOU!!!!!!! Aloha! ", "title": "", "parent": "261", "creatorid": "66bfd5de0f53", "id": "55ff8ca4f11d"}
