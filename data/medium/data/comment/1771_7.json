{"name": "1771_7", "child": "", "content": "Many pundits remarked that, during the 2016 election season, very few Americans were regularly exposed to people whose political ideology conflicted with their own. This is what we\u2019re told, true, but I question this talking point. Many \u201ccoastal elites\u201d today came from the South and Midwest to search for work or get an education. They regularly go back for family events and holidays, and have their relatives and friends who still live there come visit them. And sure, we can pretend that they never talk politics or just refuse to bring up anything controversial during that time together, but we know that can\u2019t be true. The problem is that one side of the divide is biting its elbows, to appropriate the Russian idiom for going out of one\u2019s way to near superhuman lengths, to understand a grand motivation and narrative of the other side, while said other side refuses to do anything more than blame all its problems on their counterparts, demands respect it believes it\u2019s owed, and lashes out at any criticism with unholy fury. And that makes a lot of people on the first side give up in trying to find common ground. None of the separations we have today are irreversible or require that much effort to dial back significantly. None except one. There\u2019s a large population of people who want to move forward and adapt to change, and a smaller, but still significant population which refuses to do so. And that cultural divide goes back to the first days of the American experiment\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "1771", "creatorid": "bca0b478216d", "id": "1def76a20c4d"}
