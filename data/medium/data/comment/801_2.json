{"name": "801_2", "child": "", "content": "Good stuff. Certainly food for thought for the weekend. Like I needed more to think about. Thanks?\u00a0:) Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a difference between \u201cCan it scale?\u201d and \u201cWill we unshamefully scale it?\u201d That is, just because you\u2019ve riding with your foot on the brake doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s gas in the tank, right? I mean, if you\u2019re not thinking some sort of exit strategy are you still an entrepreneur? Doesn\u2019t being exit-minded force a certain amount of focus and discipline that could be missing otherwise? Certainly Guilizzoni has a good thing going. Kudos to him. But my sense is, he\u2019s closer to an uber successful SMB than an semi-successful entrepreneur. Apples and oranges really, yes? True, it\u2019s worked out well, so far. But is he full legit or just an outlier? My sense is there are plenty of others who tried the same and were overrun and/or eaten by a scale-loving adversary. Is there another Guilizzoni somewhere kicking herself for the same approach? (Hint: Probably many.) Again, great food for thought. But perhaps some additional spices are also in order while we\u2019re on the topic? ", "title": "", "parent": "801", "creatorid": "8b3fe45d694", "id": "310d49926e6d"}
