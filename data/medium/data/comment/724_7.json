{"name": "724_7", "child": "", "content": "Thanks Alok, glad you like it. On approaching strangers, you just need to be ok with rejections. To get 5 usability tests done, I probably had to approach 20 people. But you chances will be better depending on where you do it (like people sitting down in a coffee shop). Just walk up to them and tell them you are doing a project and ask for 10 minutes. And people will be nice about it, even if they reject you. Ask some background questions to start off, and launch into your scenarios and tasks. I definitely encourage you to set a project for yourself and do some guerrilla usability tests. The more you do it the better you get. And it\u2019s fun! ", "title": "", "parent": "724", "creatorid": "6e74894b4e34", "id": "c8d161bf48bb"}
