{"name": "423_2", "child": "", "content": "Good article. I know much more about super-voting shares and dual-class share structures then when I started reading. I would like to ask; what is the point that this article is trying to make? Are you just explaining \u2018why uber won\u2019t fire its CEO\u2019 (if so, successful article!) or are you trying to make the case against founders controlling their companies? It seems to me like you\u2019re saying that founders being in control of their company is bad. Why? Who is it bad for? The founder started the firm and will live or die by it. Any employees/ investors who got in after had full knowledge of what they were getting into. If they didn\u2019t realise they were investing in a person, not just a company, then more fool them.
