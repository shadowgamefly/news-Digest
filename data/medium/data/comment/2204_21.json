I think it\u2019s great that humans have a thirst for continuously expanding their knowledge and feed their ever-growing curiosity, but this is only half of the definition of learning. The other half is applying the knowledge and putting it into practice. This is what learning is\u200a\u2014\u200aand unfortunately not something a lot of people acknowledge yet. Learning is a process which involves three actions: discovery, understanding, practice. Online education has really been, for the most part, a reflection of the traditional classes conducted in onsite learning spaces and classrooms\u200a\u2014\u200awith focus placed on content delivery / knowledge transfer. Just as the education space is being disrupted, I believe online education will see a shift in the model as well. In this article I\u2019ve written I mention the future of online education\u200a\u2014\u200awould be fantastic to get your opinions on this one, Max Lukominskyi.
