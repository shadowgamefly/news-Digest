I believe that some people are guided sometimes by the wrong things in their lives and they think that they cannot change them. Or at times their ego will not allow them to change and deconstruct the person that they have become. I believe we must find out who our true beautiful self is. Upon finding who our true beautiful self is, then we build really strong powerful boundaries to ensure we build wondeful habits that matter and that protect our true beautiful and precious self. I always listen to my heart and I use my heart as a barometer of who I am and what I am doing in my life. It\u2019s just so easy and simple. When we learn to be gentle and mindful with ourselves, we start the internal journey of self love. Lots of Love, Marina ", "title": "", "parent": "1716", "creatorid": "3258ee8f7437", "id": "cbe5d86ba2b0"}
