{"content": "There\u2019s 2 important points that are missed here. There is an outstanding definition of design(ing) that satisfies all the requirements without all of the disciplinary boundary-making bullshit. It\u2019s Herbert Simon\u2019s definition: \u201cEveryone designs who devise courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.\u201dThere\u2019s a difference between a person who happens to design\u200a\u2014\u200asomething everyone does sooner or later\u200a\u2014\u200aand someone who is a (professional) designer. The difference is that the professional has training, may even have some kind of certification, and can and does reflect on their designerly activities; the other kind lacks the training/certification and doesn\u2019t necessarily recognize that they\u2019ve designed when they do it.
