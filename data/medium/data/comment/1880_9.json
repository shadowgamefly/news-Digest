We\u2019ve never met in person but I know we at Hanno have felt really driven to keep up with what you guys have done on the transparency side of things and it has definitely made a huge positive difference to our team culture. I\u2019ve always said that I think Buffer\u2019s legacy will be far greater and longer-lasting when it comes to organisational culture than it will be for social media tools (although your product is good, too!). We\u2019re also very, very conscious of diversity in tech and our need to build a more diverse team. We\u2019ll definitely be checking out Matter really soon and I can\u2019t wait to see where you take this stuff. Great to see the Buffer Diversity Dashboard grow some legs and become a real live product\u2026 good luck with it! ", "title": "", "parent": "1880", "creatorid": "246fdd5aaedf", "id": "7aa3f3dbc264"}
