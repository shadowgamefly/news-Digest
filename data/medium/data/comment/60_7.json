{"content": "Wow. This is awesome. I\u2019ve been hella overwhelmed from everything you\u2019re mentioning here. Attempting to understand the entrepreneurial game is exhausting, and the internet feels incredibly vast and untrustworthy when you\u2019re standing at the edge of it trying to find a way in. What reliable and trustworthy resources have you used or recommended in the past? Additionally, I\u2019ve noticed that the \u201clisticles\u201d, \u201chow-to\u201ds, and \u201cyour-happiness-is-determined-by\u201ds seem to be a real problem in the wellness and entrepreneurial spaces. I\u2019m curious to know: How do you think we move beyond this model? Obviously it works, right? People fall victim to the \u201ceasy-dream\u201d and buy the product (even if only to find out later that it didn\u2019t work out). But how do we ensure artistic and professional integrity? Is there such a thing as advertising ethics that you think need to be implemented to ensure the consumer/reader can trust the seller/author? And tying it into a larger picture conversation: In a world of fake news, how do we trust the internet again? Very curious about all of this! Lots to learn. Thanks so much for sharing!
