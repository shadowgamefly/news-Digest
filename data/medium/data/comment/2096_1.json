Suppose I ask you why you need any of the things you buy, and presumed to sit in judgement over your purchases. You\u2019d tell me to F-off, and rightly so. That\u2019s all the reply anyone needs to make to you regarding why they need an AR-15, with or without a high capacity magazine. No fly, no buy? You can\u2019t even tell me how someone gets on (or off) that list. But of course, government is all wise, all knowing, and never makes mistakes\u200a\u2014\u200awell, hardly ever. I\u2019m not worried about mass shooters. The police kill more people each year than they do, and are more likely to kill me or a loved one with impunity and without consequence. They will live to kill again another day, too. They shoot men, women and children without hesitation or remorse, and always justify their actions with the same old mantra, they followed procedure. Instead of asking why someone needs an AR-15, maybe you should be asking why the police have fully automatic weapons, tanks, ammunition by the ton, and are buying more.
