Even Simmons, who has a nose for this sort of things, fell for the half assed \u201coh, it\u2019s just round numbers that bear no meaning\u201d. You know what else has no greater meaning? Groups of five guys competing to see which one is able to pass a ball through a hole the most during 48 minutes. It doesn\u2019t stop us from watching. Or writing books about it, for that matter. Westbrook\u2019s quest for Oscar Robertson\u2019s record was one of the most appealing things I\u2019ve ever seen in the NBA, and I\u2019m not a big fan of him or triple-doubles. The fact that he did it while leading the league in scoring, making end of game heroics and going for every crazy dunk makes it all the more amazing. That\u2019s why the MVP should not be all about analytics or have rigid rules. Sometimes a guy is just the best thing a season has to offer.
