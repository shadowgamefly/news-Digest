Feedbacks that go \u201cit\u2019s not that you are not ______\u00a0, but\u2026\u201d have a high probabilty of coming off as dismissive and inauthentic because instead of focusing on the issue at hand\u00a0(what\u00a0we\u00a0really\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0resolve), we dilute the focus of the conversation with mixed signals. A boss who wants to keep up with the image of being \u201cnice\u201d might want to come off as polite (foot in the door) before delivering the \u201cbad stuff\u201d; but a good leader would address the issue as-a-matter-of-factly (effectively) because it is not personal!
