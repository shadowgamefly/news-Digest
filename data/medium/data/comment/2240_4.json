I\u2019m very concerned! Seriously, we\u2019ve been trying to ditch them for years, but they follow us everywhere. As for the question of pets, alas, we are unable to have one because Wife is allergic to dog and cat ink, which they tend to shed all over the page. If she gets it on herself, Wife has to spend several hours drawing hives on herself in red pen. But never fear! As you will no doubt have observed, I have indeed begun introducing new characters for that day when Wife and I finally manage to outrun the Daughters. There is already, for example, Work Colleague, introduced only a year ago: Minute IrritationsSee more at the Awful Pictures, Terrible Words websitethecoffeelicious.com He rapidly became a massive favorite among all my fan. And, when I come up with a way to use him again, he will be a RECURRING character! How exciting is that??!! Answer: exactly one question mark less exciting than my initial thought was horrible!
