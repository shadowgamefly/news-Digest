{"name": "475_1", "child": "", "content": "Do what I did with an idea tonight. Make a list! State what you want to talk about. For example, I wanted to write about: what is true citizenship? Is it pride in where you live or do you just feel like a prisoner? Then, list what comes to mind relative to that main idea. For example, I consider myself a citizen because I pay taxes, I\u2019m a registered voter, etc. I consider myself a prisoner because I live in a crappy apartment, and so on. Finally, when you feel you have enough information to write your piece, go ahead! My list has yet to be turned into paragraphs but that\u2019s happening somewhere down the road. Best of luck.
