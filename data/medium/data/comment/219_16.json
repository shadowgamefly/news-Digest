And it\u2019s also a finite source where EVERYTHING written there, and not just the latest updates, were written for a reason. When you get things out there for free, you\u2019re selling out at the lowest price. \u201cFor Free\u201d means \u201cI can enjoy this whenever and wherever I see fit, regardless of the intentions of the author/blogger\u201d\u2026 and that is just not how things are. Because that would imply what you have done with your time is disposable and postponable (gee, I wonder how many artists would really say this out loud with a straight face). Everyone have different answers I guess\u2026 but certainly, \u201cthings for free\u201d is the worst price tag for everyone, since it turns authors and artists into forceful bohemians that are obliged to live on charity to keep doing what they love. And for people like me that do what they do, that is certainly an unsustainable enterprise, regardless of what the majority says. Those annoying pop-ups, at least, make the reader THINK about the place where s/he got that narcoticarticle that changed his/her life (and we, stupid humans, tend to forget where we came from, and who helped us get where we are). All that said, this is a great article. ", "title": "", "parent": "219", "creatorid": "5d3ed2bca09f", "id": "f45d0f53e1fe"}
