{"name": "345_9", "child": "", "content": "Nanit is fantastic. Great promo video as well. With the onslaught of IOT devices security has become a big issue. I\u2019m glad Nanit is securely encrypted. I like the video capturing feature. Regarding computer vision, it would be great for businesses as well. Business owners do not have time to view hours of videos, even in fast motion. Computer vision can help detect when employees are lounging around or goofing off, e.g., the restaurant business (of which I\u2019ve owned a few). There\u2019s lots of opportunities for Nanit to expand beyond the baby monitor. ", "title": "", "parent": "345", "creatorid": "3fb03aa94393", "id": "9f3177739825"}
