May 3rd is the day I decided I was slowly killing myself\u2026and I walked away from a bunch of bucks and a job I used to love. I ignored many physical signs of burnout and I am still physically paying for them one year later\u2026high cholesterol from bad lifestyle choices, the works. People ask me what I want to do after 20 years of killing my SELF and one year of not and I still don\u2019t know. However, I do know I would rather spend the time figuring it out with my husband and daughter versus no longer being here for them ever. This is serious and money is not even close to everything. God bless. If you need help for your mission, I am unemployed and I am awesome at what I do. Ha! Thank you again. I was a fan of both of your enterprises and now I love them more.
