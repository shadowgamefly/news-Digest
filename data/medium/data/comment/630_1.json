I think one of the most important notes you make is \u201cYou may not get everything done, but you need the plan to stay efficient.\u201d Many founders will read articles and road maps like these, get overwhelmed, think the list of items is too idealistic, and then not do anything at all. The important thing, as you mentioned, is the intention and execution around your team\u2019s specific goals for launch. Even if you only complete one item per list you lay out in this piece, as long as it is the most essential item for your team, you\u2019d already position yourself to be ahead of 95% of the competition.
