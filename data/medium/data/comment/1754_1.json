My writing became weekly between writing for myself and writing for the agency I was working with. I finally stepped up and started writing for my own design newsletter. Each has been a new experiment on shaping my writing ability to add value to people. I feel like I\u2019m starting to taste a few of the things you talked about here so thank you. It\u2019s more of the validation I needed as well that I\u2019m on the right track. I appreciate it \ud83d\udc4d ", "title": "", "parent": "1754", "creatorid": "8ce465e9cbe8", "id": "59768d1bde53"}
