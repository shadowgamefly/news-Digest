{"content": "Oh please, this is really going out of your way to create a class warfare angle. I fly about 100,000 miles a year most of it coach and I go to places most other people don\u2019t go. I have had a lot of bad experiences on airlines including United but this is not class warfare, it is simply a tone deaf organization, some stupid security people getting out of hand. I have been on airplanes asking for volunteers and I have not gotten off because of the lack of options to get to my destination and have seen airlines handle it in various ways, increase the cash award, increase the comps at hotels, personal requests. United just plain screwed up here. I feel really bad for the man in the situation to feel powerless is a terrible situation but he wasn\u2019t targeted by class or ethnicity, a computer randomly selected people which was stupid in its own right. Not everything that happens is a demonstration of animus sometimes it is just plain stupidity.
