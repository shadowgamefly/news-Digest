{"name": "1354_2", "child": "", "content": "I can relate to the team anythings, and the awkward feeling at dinner tables. I have been a vegetarian for 20 years and went vegan four years ago, when this was unknown over here in western europe. I still did it, because it felt right. My body asked for it. And I still love it. Even though veganism is more and more known here now, and more restaurants open that understand it, people still often don\u2019t. I always get the same jokes about how I don\u2019t know what I am missing and the size of their cow-bit on a coal fire. But I have learned to smile and nod, and forget about it. Often I don\u2019t even listen. I have learned that I don\u2019t actually care what other people might think. And I won\u2019t make a huge fuss if I can only get a simple green salad, actually, I\u2019ll take that any day. Now please keep treating us to your words. They\u2019re pretty good.
