{"name": "691_20", "child": "", "content": "Kanban has some drawbacks that make it difficult or less desirable to work with. Visual part is a good thing but being able to visualize all moving parts of a project actually means not representing the details of individual work tracks. Otherwise we will end up cluttering the Kanban board/chart. I feel Kanban works for Epic like high level features. And it also works for short duration stuff. We invariably end up with a different work item tracker to support all that is missing on a Kanban board. This makes it double the work to track projects. I was never successful in running a project using Kanban alone. Probably it is just me. ", "title": "", "parent": "691", "creatorid": "aeb8f9f8dd81", "id": "e5e1ef1845fa"}
