{"name": "1038_2", "child": "", "content": "Great post! I\u2019m one of the co-founders of HackerOne, and here over at H1 we could not agree more that public vulnerability reports are one of the best ways to learn about security. Practical examples of issues other companies were affected by are so much better than the theoretical book examples we are used to. You may also want to check out Hacktivity: https://hackerone.com/hacktivity. A real time feed of publicly disclosed vulnerability reports. Other members of the community upvote each entry a la Reddit, so in a way they\u2019re doing the filtering for you.\u00a0:) And if you are really into it, I can highly recommend giving Web Hacking 101 a read! The book takes reports published on Hacktivity and analyzes them. Happy learning! ", "title": "", "parent": "1038", "creatorid": "ca22add6d44e", "id": "a4c1854660d8"}
