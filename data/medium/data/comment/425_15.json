{"name": "425_15", "child": "", "content": "Interesting article, thank you for posting. I happen to work for an OTA and can say that OTAs do have some of the best deals out there, but we are limited by the inventory that our air, hotel and rental partners provide e us. Many partners are trying to enter the market themselves, by going straight to Google for example, and selling their inventory straight to the consumer. OTAs (like Priceline, Booking and Expedia) as well as meta search sites like Kayak, Trivalgo and Skyscanner are a great resource but I would always warn a customer that they should shop around and not simple go with the first site or option that they find.
