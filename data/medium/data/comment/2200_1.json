I run fearlessly into the proverbial burning fire without stopping to calculate the risk:reward ratio. That serves me well sometimes. I once took a local weekly newspaper, put on my editor\u2019s hat (which, by the way, I had completely fabricated in my own mind out of construction paper and glue sticks,) marked it up with a red pen, and marched myself into the editor\u2019s office to show him proof of why he really needed to hire me. I ended up as a section editor and features writer at that same paper. Most of the time this tendency is not my friend. I\u2019ve jumped head-first into bad jobs, relationships, and major life choices. So many of those decisions yielded disastrous results. I think I shall try to learn to fear some things, if for no other reason than to use it as a tempering agent for my fearlessness. In the end I may actually achieve some life balance. Fingers and toes crossed, I\u2019ll walk slowly to that bridge before I leap off. \ud83d\ude0d ", "name": "2200_1", "id": "a03aa719ae6"}
