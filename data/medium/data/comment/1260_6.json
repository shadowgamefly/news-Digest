It\u2019s no use fighting for strong opinions. It\u2019s no use telling people what to do or using rational arguments to get people to do what you would like them to do, even if it\u2019s to treat you nicer. This is the argument for living by example. Even in life: Show and don\u2019t tell\u2026. Nobody is ever thinking about you. They are worried about what you think of them\u2026. Every time I feel stressed or anxious, this is usually because I am worried irrationally (because all people are irrational) about something invisible happening in the future\u2026. Happiness is fleeting and often beyond our control. We\u2019re happy when we hit a goal. And then it disappears\u2026. I can only do the best I can right now and then surrender the results. Once you release the bowling ball, your job is done. Once I give you a kiss to wake you up, the feeling you have when you open your eyes and look at me, is totally up to you\u2026.\u201d~ James\u00a0Altucher lback_tries\u201d:\u201dC441CE693A132A7BF28131ABC9856BB6DCC85768AEC48EBCFACCE6BDC0B49D55\"}} ", "title": "", "parent": "1260", "creatorid": "e7b8ae69a37b", "id": "6722ed090ef8"}
