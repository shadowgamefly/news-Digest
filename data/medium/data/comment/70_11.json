{"id": "6879bb203e67", "content": "Tristan, Thank you for sharing your experience, especially the explicit what to do and most importantly what not to do. I want to highlight two points you touched upon but I think could really should be emphasized much more: When it comes to Salesforce, the key is to make sure all of the data goes into it. I\u2019ve been in many situations when Salesforce is used selectively in the organization. Making sure all teams take the time to log and categorize everything in Salesforce, pays dividends in so many ways later when you want to see why you lost deals, what features were deal breakers, who you can re-engage with, etc. Second is analysis paralysis. You mentioned it briefly, but founders get going and are good at making intuitive decisions. When they bring in analytics, all of a sudden they are unable to make a decision without enough data and things grind to a halt. While analytics are important, absence of data should not be an excuse for avoiding a decision. ", "creatorid": "c607e462437e", "title": "", "parent": "70", "child": "", "name": "70_11"}
