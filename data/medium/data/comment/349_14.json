{"name": "349_14", "child": "", "content": "Hi Dan, You made me cry today but i can only thank you for sharing such love with us too. My grandpa is the same to me. A person who treated me as his equal when i was half his size in the world of Adults. No, he is not perfect. He is there with all his flaws and faults. But to me, to that little too brainy girl, he is the one who loved me for all that i was. All i have of him are his memories, his picture engraved in my heart, his wonderful daughter and the love and respect he gave me. I just wish he is here to see me grow, to tell me how proud he is of what i have made out of myself and one last chance to tell him how much i love him and cherish his presence in my life. If your letter can move strangers like me and make them remember their own stories, I\u2019m sure your grandfather will definitely feel your love for him even if he doesn\u2019t remember. Keep writing to him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll cherish all those. ", "title": "", "parent": "349", "creatorid": "762571281737", "id": "aa16b5a56006"}
