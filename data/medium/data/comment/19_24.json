{"name": "19_24", "child": "", "content": "Surprised not to see more people ranking all the movies instead of just saying their opinions on one or two of then. For me it\u2019s: 1.Fast Five 2.The Fast & the Furious 3.Fast & Furious 6 4.Fast & Furious 5.2 Fast 2 Furious 6.Tokyo Drift (I haven\u2019t seen Furious 7 yet but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll be top 3 for me) The fact that they\u2019re doing an 8th movie without Paul Walker (& a 9th & 10th) leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll watch those. Just seems totally unnecessary. Especially when 7 was marketed as \u201cone last ride\u201d. Should\u2019ve just ended it there.
