{"name": "1383_3", "child": "", "content": "Shane, I find your article spot on. I am a psychiatrist and I warned everyone about the perils of Trump long before the election. But his supporters failed to see the monster before them and would not listen to reason. Now, we are almost a month into his ghastly and unnerving presidency and each day becomes more bleak. I think you can now add that he does not care about danger to others as shown by the botched and poorly planned military operation resulting in 20 innocent casualties, and loss/injury to members of the Special Forces. He showed no remorse or regret. I hope you will re-run this article. Thank you. Donna J. Gowin, MD. ", "title": "", "parent": "1383", "creatorid": "f3e46624b84b", "id": "72b5aad57199"}
