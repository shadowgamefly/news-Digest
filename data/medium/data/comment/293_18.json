I force myself to pause, and jot it down in an ideas book. It doesn\u2019t matter if I never look at it again in my life, I have 10+ full notebooks and sketchbooks of ideas. The point is I allowed myself the freedom to imagine something differently, and it has become a way of life. Though it can get me into trouble, not everyone wants the ideas. I\u2019d rather get in the way just a little than sit back and do nothing. I can\u2019t stop myself from ideating\u00a0!
