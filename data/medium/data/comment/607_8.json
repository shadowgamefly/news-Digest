Mass-producing paintings that are near-perfect copies of photographs is an intrinsically crass idea and shows you simply haven\u2019t understood the point of painting at all. And your moral vacuousness is shown by the fact that, even though we all know that Chinese workers are paid very badly and your whole business model involves hiring labor at a fraction of the price that you could get in the US, there\u2019s no point in the article you discuss \u201cfair wages\u201d or making sure that your offshore workers are well-treated. Perhaps you are doing it behind the scenes\u200a\u2014\u200abut it isn\u2019t important enough for you to mention. Of course, your company won\u2019t last two years. Honestly, how big is the market for paintings that look exactly like photographs? And even if it were sizable, you\u2019re in an area that\u2019s not defensible\u200a\u2014\u200aanyone in China can set up a company to compete with you and undercut your price, because they won\u2019t have to be paying venture capitalists, nor six-figure wages to a bunch of San Francisco tech people. You\u2019re also competing with anyone who just runs a Photoshop filter on a printer and prints it onto paper and frames it\u200a\u2014\u200awhich costs less and has basically the same effect for most people who don\u2019t care about art, which is your target audience.
