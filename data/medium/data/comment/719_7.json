{"name": "719_7", "child": "", "content": "Agree in a bunch of ways. I do still think UX Designer is an appropriate title So much as a product manager is though. A UX designer may not implement all the things that ultimately bring about a good user experience but they should be managing and forcing discussion on a lot of them. For instance, I as a UX designer do not build the front end system that sends the API call to the database and receives the response in X amount of time, but I sure as he am the one fighting for reduced time or asynchronous calls in order to improve the UX\u00a0while\u00a0also\u00a0keeping\u00a0functionality\u00a0that\u00a0would\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0feeling\u00a0of\u00a0speed. If I left it more to the development team they would make it faster, but make the user wait for more loading screens etc. I, as a UX designer try to instruct what doc pages are most important for actually using a system and what kind of content is in it. If it were left purely to content writers they would have all the documentation well written, but it wouldn\u2019t be accessible from the right locations and the content I find is important for the user may not be prioritized to them. I as a UX designer know what information needs to be call out or emphasized to direct a user. Were it left purely to a visual designer the page would be gorgeous but the button to go to the next page may not be visible. Yes a good UX is a combination of many people and disciplines. But the purpose of a UX designer is to A) understand and prioritize user needs and B) collaborate and prioritize with the various disciplines to meet those user needs. That is why they get the title of UX Designer and not a visual or front end developer or interaction designer. They often manage the entire experience from development to visual to docs to user as well as do one or more of those other disciplines.
