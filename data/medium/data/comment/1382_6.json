{"name": "1382_6", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m a programmer and I both can and do criticize software that fails to work as intended or continually has intractable bugs. You can tell a lot about software without viewing the source code. You can tell a lot about a building without ripping it up to see inside. You can tell enough about a person to draw a conclusion about an obvious mental problem by watching the the thousands of hours of interviews he has given, the statements he has given, the books he has written or had ghost written and approved, the books written by his close associates and ex wife(s), and just like these other records, decades of records of his actions in court and business dealings. This was a detailed analysis and this is a specific diagnosis that is agreed upon because there IS ample evidence. The question of ethics about diagnosing someone you haven\u2019t examined in person is entirely moot when someones actions are history are on tape and on the record and even statements of his actions as recorded by those close to him are available. A rule and guideline in place to prevent hasty conclusions or diagnosis from hearsay among other issues simply does not apply in this particular case. Anyone is free to refute this appraisal which goes through each point with evidence but you have to refute them. ", "title": "", "parent": "1382", "creatorid": "9369e2168f96", "id": "6166036fd752"}
