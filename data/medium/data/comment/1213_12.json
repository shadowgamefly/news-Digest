{"name": "1213_12", "child": "", "content": "I am so pleased by your strength, and your confidence to remain who you are! I am now a 66 year old American female, with a B.A. and two master\u2019s degrees. I have been married,(at 23, still too young), separated (walked away at 40), divorced (FINALLY, at 44, and lost everything, even in a \u201cjoint property\u201d state)\u2026 spent nearly five years independent (different from \u201calone\u201d, and NOT lonely). \u2026I repartnered (at 46) and was widowed (at 59) after three years of his cancer and 2 months of hospice (all financially devastating)\u2026 repartnered again (at 60)\u2026with a much younger man, with much deeper thought, and more insight. We are still blissfully happy; I retired from family counseling and teaching, and now operate a historic B&B part time. Now, He keeps his \u201cday job\u201d so we can afford for me to be the Innkeeper. I will tell you that formal marriage is highly overrated even now, and my informal partnerships were far more rewarding, moral and \u201csolid\u201d than that sham of a 22-year marriage I had\u2026 Like you, I am intelligent and well-educated, and worked hard to get where I am. I too am busty, and a bit overweight by standards of beauty at the moment, but I will tell you that this third man, Partnership #2, is the most wonderful of all. He is not a college graduate, is from an immigrant family much less established than mine was, yet is very intelligent, hard working, very secure in himself, and so, loves me well for who I am. If I had not stumbled upon him though, I was ready to remain unmarried and unpartnered. I can be just fine that way, and here, I know many, many women AND men, who feel the same way. Marriage, even long term partnerships, are not for everyone. Nor do they \u201cmake us whole\u201d\u00a0\u2026nor does a marriage certificate ensure our safety or that the guy will remain faithful or physically with us, or our children\u2026 A relationship is only as good and honorable as the two who make a pledge. It is my view that, if it must be put in writing, the trust is shaky\u00a0already. Not to be entirely naiive here though, I have had to agree with MYSELF that what I give here is \u201cwithout strings\u201d, and that I will walk away, with my cat, cash, clothes and computer, essentially, under the following conditions: domestic violence (no one ever lays a hand on me in violence again)\u2026 no cheating or intimate, private relations with other women\u00a0(or\u00a0men,\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0case)..no lies, even of omission (and stealingor embezzlement from the partnership is a form of lying)\u2026 no hard drugs. I promise the same. If I find proof of this, there will be no need for recourse, no excuses, no apologies, no counseling, and no trying again\u2026also no lawsuit or retribution. I just go away, no more contact permitted\u00a0(we\u00a0have\u00a0no\u00a0children\u00a0together). It\u2019s pretty peaceful, actually, and much cheaper and less complicated than divorce\u2026been there, done that, lost everything except spousal support from his Navy retirement. I have not seen or tried to reach him in any way in 23 years. My now-partner and I renew this agreement on our anniversary each year. No one can claim entrapment. If one becomes dissatisfied with any part of this clear and simple agreement\u00a0(since\u00a0humans\u00a0are\u00a0dynamic,\u00a0not\u00a0static\u00a0creatures), they can renegotiate. If that fails, we shake hands and go away friends\u2026 going on 8 years now, and have had no serious disagreements or cheating on any part of the agreement. So I guess the long and short is, do NOT let Anyone goad you into marriage--or even long term partnership, if your very gut does not see it to be right. Do not compromise on the basics of what are \u201cdeal-breakers\u201d for you. Obviously, if a potential match does not agree, it would have you both miserable in the end anyway,\u00a0so\u00a0do\u00a0not\u00a0start.\u00a0Just\u00a0stay\u00a0amicable. Best of luck in your life and career, as WHO you know you ARE! Congratulations! Gillian ", "title": "", "parent": "1213", "creatorid": "833975d45c29", "id": "1252dc481da0"}
