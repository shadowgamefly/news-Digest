Sigh\u2026 Clown cars are funny right up to the point they start running over and killing people. A health care plan that actually takes health care away from those who need it and gives tax breaks to those who least need them, gutting the EPA and rewarding chemical companies with the pen that was used to allow them to more easily produce dangerous chemicals, nominating a supreme court justice that has consistently ruled for corporations over people. There seems to be one guideline that this administration consistently follows, if there\u2019s money to be made, how can we grease the skids to get more, faster. Resources are to be exploited and not conserved. The people who voted for Trump thought they would be getting someone who would shake things up, to reverse the downward trend of their financial well being. Sorry folks, he\u2019s doubling down on the policies and people that put you on that decline in the first place. Trump\u2019s a business man, his whole life was to make money for himself, his family and his friends. Have you ever gotten a Christmas card from him? If yes, then lucky you! If no, then consider yourself a small part of an ever growing exploitable resource that he and his cohorts love so much.
