{"name": "296_7", "child": "", "content": "Measurement is key Charles Chu Thanks for the RescueTime tip. I have not formally measured my computer time yet. Frankly, I am a bit nervous to see the results. I have made a great deal of progress on hard/fast policies (I don\u2019t use Facebook at all, for instance). However, I worry about how I am doing within the places I am supposed to be an efficient actor (Trello, Medium, Github, Gmail, etc.). I will also employ the pen and paper route as you mentioned. My non-computer time is likely where more of the inefficiency and waste lives. Thanks! ", "title": "", "parent": "296", "creatorid": "57b84cd20245", "id": "dc414c6d1474"}
