{"name": "1251_2", "child": "", "content": "Orson Scott Card in \u201cThe Worthing Saga\u201d, which he was playing around within in the 1970s the same time as Ender\u2019s Game, focused a lot on the idea of what if people could freeze themselves, wake-up, do stuff for a week, and then go back under for 10 years. In the frozen long life scenario, I agree with his view which is people will be more willing to take the long-view of things. This is to say, sustainable would trump the quick buck. Technology would be slow and steady (rather than at current rapid rate or at the feared forever dream deferred rate). Mars trip might not happen for 100 years but when we go, there would be robots there that have been slowly mining for 50 years and everything is basically set-up to stay.
