{"name": "712_10", "child": "", "content": "Nice article! I agree with you and I would add some more things about this subject. One of them is the fact I\u2019ve observed some portfolios and it is hard to see good materials prepared for Android. In most of cases designers prefere designing for iOS than Android apps. It has causing some difficulties to inspire designers designing for Android. I liked when you put Dropbox and Airbnb as examples because when you compare iOS and Android you won\u2019t see huge diferences for these apps. You\u2019ll see brand\u2019s consistence. Besides that, almost the same way to navigate, even comparing app with website. ", "title": "", "parent": "712", "creatorid": "ee8af96b5841", "id": "1afd18e908e3"}
