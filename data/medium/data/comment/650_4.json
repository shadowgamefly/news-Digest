While I can understand \u201cpraying\u201d (I meditate and incorporate some declarations about my day/intentions), having faith is a tough phrase to accept. I think there is something here though. It makes a statement about what I can do, what dreams I can accomplish. Without faith, my goals are just wishes with plans, but not backed by confidence. If nothing else, I need to have faith in myself and the validity of my dreams. ", "title": "", "parent": "650", "creatorid": "c739e5fdb04d", "id": "71acfdbe9d12"}
