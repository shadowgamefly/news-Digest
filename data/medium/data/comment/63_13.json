{"id": "f6a8cad028c8", "content": "Congratulations on the success of your group! I run a similar group in California, though we aren\u2019t strictly an FCC site we do use some FCC material. Like you, I just started out holding regular meets and hoping for the best. We now have a formal 12 session introduction to code class as well as less formal study groups. Check us out at www.codeslo.com and be sure to send me an email. We\u2019re starting to organize online hackathons with other large coding groups like yours and it would be fun to get you involved!
