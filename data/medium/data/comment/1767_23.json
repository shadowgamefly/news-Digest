{"name": "1767_23", "child": "", "content": "As an atheist I find every call for censorship either made by governments or by companies to be a cause for concern because I know I am in the minority position. The matter of the fact is these decisions of what to censor or not will be made by people in power and with specific agendas, the government will censor speech that points to their wrong doings and failures and companies will censor speech that is either unpopular, leads to loss of revenue or that shows their bad practices. So as a minority I want the freedom do say whatever I want even if means offending some religious sensibilities. Censorship is a bad idea exactly because it helps the powers that be to continue to be, and its is also robs everyone of the freedom to decide whats is good or bad. It is a conservative/regressive frame of mind that breeds censorship, it is elitist, it is infantilizing and it is specially a intellectually weak position, it shows that you are not sure you can argue your point in a convincing way so you have to block the other sides arguments. No matter how you spin it you are asking for censorship, if you want to live in a bubble please don\u2019t force it on everyone else.
