While it is a relatively new relationship, the intimacy both physical and emotional we have together, brings me into the present moment, and opens my heart in ways I did not know were possible.\u201d When I was single I focused on my career. When I started dating I focused on us. When we had children, I focused on family. My perspective (and priorities) changed radically each time, never to return. Nothing is as it was, and I expect it will continue to evolve. For each change, I have a decision to make: do I embrace it or recoil? Am I better off remaining single or should I pursue marriage? Do I handle people better with my career, or is a family a better choice? Tough questions when confronted with a potential \u201csoul mate.\u201d Joy, like sorrow, is temporary\u200a\u2014\u200athe mere reaction to the situation I find myself in.
