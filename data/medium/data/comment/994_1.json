{"name": "994_1", "child": "", "content": "Have you ever thought about just getting out for a run? Maybe working out in other ways at home? If it is just weight control, getting into a 5 day running regimen and proper diet, will go a long way. Mix in some bodyweight exercises and you will get all you need to maintain your figure and feel better. Also, you might pick up your favorite machine for much cheaper than a year at the gym and all of the other expenses involved. Having something to do inside helps for those days when outside just sucks. Wish you the best. ", "title": "", "parent": "994", "creatorid": "da8a75281833", "id": "53052d4dcef3"}
