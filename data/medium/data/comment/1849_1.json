It just means that you don\u2019t like reading, because reading actually is a morally neutral act. I believe this\u201d- OH SO TRUE. My version of this is hiking and camping. My deal breaker is people who act like I said I like to stab puppies when I reveal that I don\u2019t enjoy camping or hiking that much. I think there\u2019s something absurd about packing a simulacrum of a house in a backpack, carrying it out to a smooth place in the dirt, recreating a tiny fragile house that\u2019s less comfortable than an actual house and being like \u201cAHHHHH this is the best way to spend my free time! No one else knows pure joy or simplicity like I do.\u201d while freezing in the back and roasting in the front and shivering and pretending like you are reading that copy of walden you brought with you\u2026not listening for bears. And for the record I love to stay in cabins and I\u2019ll walk a very long distance if there\u2019s points of interest and i have camped a lot, my disinterest comes from intimate knowledge. Camping and people\u2019s superiority\u2026ugh. I\u2019m not trying to stop anyone from camping at all, go ahead, but I don\u2019t personally care for it, and I\u2019m still a very nice human.
