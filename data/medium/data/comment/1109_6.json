{"name": "1109_6", "child": "", "content": "Why did the religious right vote for Trump if he is antithetical to their values? Because he is not, he represents what they want, to use religion as a sword against others. Its hypocritical to vote for evil then complain that evil is coming to fruition. If they are actually having buyers remorse then why did it take a generation of voting republican, right wing ideology is about taking from the poor to give to the rich, the opposite of what the church claims to believe in. If they have truly learned something i expect religious voting patterns to drastically change and never vote republican again. I will bet money that will not happen.
