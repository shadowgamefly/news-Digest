{"content": "I love this article. I\u2019m an American (born and raised in Oakland, CA) living in Zagreb, Croatia while I teach at the university for a semester, and I\u2019ve been amazed at the number of Chinese tour groups that have been here ever since I arrived in December, when it was very, very cold. (Other wimpier cultures\u200a\u2014\u200aAmericans, French, Germans\u200a\u2014\u200aare only just now arriving.) Yes, they have the flags and hats (and selfie sticks!), but they generally have been very courteous as I scoot past them to walk home in the afternoons. I haven\u2019t experienced the pushiness or loudness, but then again, there\u2019s more room here than there is on Market St. at home in San Francisco! They are roughly of retirement age, so I have wondered what their individual histories are, given what happened during their life spans. Your article helps. It makes me want to talk to some tour guides and find out what their impressions of Zagreb are.
