Just one thing I wanted to tell you is that IMDB also has the concept of most useful user reviews which also helps at least me as a user to judge a movie\u00a0. It would be great f you can incorporate that into your project\u00a0. It would make it more complex and interesting in a way\u00a0, but will take you even more closer to actual reality.Also\u00a0, i am interested in how would you conceptualize to take this into statistical domain.
