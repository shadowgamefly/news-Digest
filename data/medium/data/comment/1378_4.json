{"name": "1378_4", "child": "", "content": "Trump \u201cleads\u201d via a cult of personality. Being the PEOTUS gives him additional leverage: he insists on deference from the\u00a0media. His ridiculous tweets, statements and assorted lies are largely regurgutated without the vital analysis necessary to determine the actual\u00a0truth. By and large, the mainstream media replies in a synchophatic fashion, which is horribly dangerous. People deserve to have a critical analysis available to them\u200a\u2014\u200anot inherently negative, per se, but analyzed for fact-checking, background info, and possible repurcussions. The idea of a Twitter-based presidency, where press conferences are evidently a thing of the past, leaves me feeling like we\u2019re in a surreal dream, from which we all need to wake. The kleptocracy, Plutocratic cronyism, plethora of conflicts of interest, and rampant corruption are already dizzying, and Trump hasn\u2019t even been inaugurated\u00a0yet. Trump also refuses to use the State Department protocol for calls with world leaders\u200a\u2014\u200asecured lines, pre-call briefings, translators, et\u00a0al. (Why? I\u2019d guess ego, and Trump not trusting anyone but his close family.) If he had used the State Department resources properly, we wouldn\u2019t now have the diplomacy issue resulting from the Taiwan call. This could potentially be a huge problem, scanning decades, for our relationship with China. I think constantly of the old Chinese curse: \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d The curse worked, it seems, because things are indeed \u201cinteresting.\u201d Another word that might work is \u201chorrifying.\u201d But, hey\u2026 Poh-TAY-toe, poh-TAH-toe, right? Namast\u00e9 to everyone. Remember to\u00a0breathe! ", "title": "", "parent": "1378", "creatorid": "31be3c0816f9", "id": "752521ed1449"}
