{"name": "601_20", "child": "", "content": "Definitely will take a look at what you\u2019re doing. Thanks for sharing the lessons learned. I\u2019m in the thick of building an early-stage company with a small team and am doing everything I can to avoid some of these same issues. One of the things that I\u2019ve done, which you might consider from a legal standpoint, is setting up type A and type B common stock, where type A controls more votes per share than type B. In this way, you can share a larger interest in the company with early workforce and a co-founder without the possibility of getting ousted from your own company. This happens to be how Google is structured so that Larry Page and Sergey Brin can keep control of their business even though they no longer own 51% of the business. I hope this helps.
