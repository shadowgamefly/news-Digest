{"name": "1615_1", "child": "", "content": "Very interesting idea, I look forward to reading the entire series. I\u2019m a bit stuck on the politics however. My interests here are twofold. First, finding ways to improve access to quality and affordable health care that are politically doable. Second, finding ways to move back to back to bi-partisan problem solving as norm (or at least a recognized good) and not evidence of failure that deserves electoral punishment. Advancing those interests makes the already incredibly difficult job of working with an entrenched health care and insurance system that is the result of accidents and unintended consequences as much as it is anything else, more difficult my adding Congress and election to the mix. I am interested in both what ought to get done, and what can get done. Thanks again for sending the link to your pieces and for your comments and recommendation.
