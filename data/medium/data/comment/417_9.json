{"name": "417_9", "child": "", "content": "Microsoft are dead to me as a company. I use their products, with reluctance, and fully intend switching to Linux over time. I dislike Windows 8, have vowed to NEVER use Windows 10 Spyware on any machine I own and will stick with Windows 7 as long as possible. After that, Linux. Their arrogance and dismissal of what users want (Windows 7 improved and enhanced, not redesigned and messed up with spyware, thanks!) has led me from defending them to despising the company. Pay through your nose forever for Office 365? No thanks! Windows 10 as a \u201cservice\u201d (spyware is a service?) that you cannot stop \u201cupdating\u201d? No thanks! That company is determined to get rid of me as a customer. It\u2019s working. Recently I wanted a tablet/laptop combo. Looked at the Surface. Spyware 10. No thanks! Looked at other laptops. Spyware 10 too. No thanks! Ended up getting Windows 8.1 installed onto a Win10 laptop. My next laptop will be Linux. Microsoft can go %$# themselves.
