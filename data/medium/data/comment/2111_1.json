So even just on a \u2018practical\u2019 level, meditation helps to calm the \u201cego\u201d center enough, that it starts to make us more aware of all these other influences, which in turn makes all our thoughts and actions less \u2018conflicted\u2019 and operating more as \u2018one\u2019. In strategic terms, think of the ego as your \u2018command and control\u2018 center, with meditation filtering out the \u2018static\u2019 and \u2018interference\u2019.
