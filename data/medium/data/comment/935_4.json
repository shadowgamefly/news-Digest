The only part that did not make sense to me is your statement that \u201cthe odds of a bailout in the next century are still nearly 70 percent.\u201d I know you are just talking about banks, but if you are really meant to say \u201cover the next 10o years\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahistory tells us that the odds of multiple government bank bailouts is almost certainly 100%. I think most observers would be more interested in the odds you would put on a major government private sector bailout in the next ten years. Government Bailouts in last 50 years: 1970 Penn Central Railroad; 1971 Lockheed; 1974 Franklin National Bank; 1975 New York City; 1980 Chrysler; 1984 CIN Bank and Trust; 1989 Savings and Loan failures; 2001 Airline Industry; 2008 TARP, Bear Stearns, Fannie, Freddie, AIG, Auto Industry, Citigroup; 2009 Bank of America.
