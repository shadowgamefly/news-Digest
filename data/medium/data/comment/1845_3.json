{"name": "1845_3", "child": "", "content": "Loved this article, thank you. After a post-election mental break-down where I was stuck to social media like gum to a shoe, I turned completely off, turned off news, meditated, moved and listened to music. I realized what a truly unconscious life I\u2019d been living\u2026eating in front of a computer, TV, drinking too much alcohol and caffeine, speaking too soon and too much etc. I was unable to focus my attention on just one thing for a meaningful length of time. While I\u2019ve slipped back into unconscious habits, daily meditation really helps and I\u2019m to the point where it\u2019s a necessity. I hope to convince my family to join me in meditation and disconnecting from tech to connect in reality, but I\u2019ve also come to realize that it\u2019s difficult to change yourself and changing other people may take more energy than I have. What do you think about the brainwave music? ", "title": "", "parent": "1845", "creatorid": "19236a61f819", "id": "174139bb34f4"}
