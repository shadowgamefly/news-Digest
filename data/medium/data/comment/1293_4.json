{"name": "1293_4", "child": "", "content": "The only issue I have with \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018their\u2019 is that I was taught in my English classes that this doesn\u2019t reference who \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018their\u2019 are and that a person might ask a question as to whom these statements refer. In other words; \u201cWho\u2019s she, the Cat\u2019s mother?\u201d I have been experimenting with neutral-gender antecedents as I am a science fiction writer who likes to explore the less common types of races there could be. In the past I was experimenting with a race that had 4 sexes; male, female, baby-carrier and dronal. You can\u2019t refer to the dronal or baby-carrier as \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019 because they don\u2019t fit the part (and don\u2019t have the parts). I notice (but bear in mind that this is a generalisation and there are exceptions) that a large swathe of African and Asian bloggers, especially males, have difficulty connecting with a wider audience because they only reference male antecedents. I feel they are missing out on a much bigger market by being so narrow in their focus. ", "title": "", "parent": "1293", "creatorid": "44f55bc6fb2b", "id": "37f55b9b7be3"}
