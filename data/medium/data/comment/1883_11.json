{"name": "1883_11", "child": "", "content": "You sound like a rude and whiny. You have the audacity to complain about your manager asking you to rap\u2026when you made the rap, and for work related purposes. If you were white and your song was country folk\u200a\u2014\u200aand you made it for your job\u200a\u2014\u200ado you think she wouldn\u2019t ask you? News flash: it\u2019s not okay to walk around acting rude at work. Are you too stupid to know that? You purposely got yourself fired to get severance, you made a blog post openly bashing your company for being racist and you\u2019re surprised they didn\u2019t like your attitude? Their mistake was hiring you in the first place. You have the audacity to play the race card and pander for sympathy.
