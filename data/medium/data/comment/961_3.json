{"name": "961_3", "child": "", "content": " Opinion Rufus looks good, with or without the perfectly-groomed beard. I deeply appreciate style in a man: Silver Foxmedium.com My impression was that he\u2019s on his way back to the US and was only going to be here for a few days. The auditorium was packed. I didn\u2019t hear about the event until the same day. I attempted to bribe people on Twitter for tickets with this hand-sewn-by-me bald-eagle/brown-bear bag: I approached the people in the queue but even though they politely admired the bag, they didn\u2019t find it sufficiently enticing to give up their tickets, not unless I offered more money. We laughed and joked; everybody was in a good mood, but no tickies were forthcoming. My 14-year-old son was chafing at the bit so I gave him the 200kr that his ticket would have cost and he hurried to the store to buy the simple ingredients for the most delicious home-cooked food I\u2019ve eaten in a long time. He made a rice vermicelli dish with chicken and broccoli that tasted heavenly and that was ready for me when I got home from hobnobbing with the beautiful and the famous. You see, I decided to wait and take my chances. Isn\u2019t there always someone who dosen\u2019t show? This time, luckily for me, there was. I had pled my case with the young lady at the door and at five minutes to five she smiled and waved me in. Rufus was lively, interesting and well-informed; I enjoyed the evening, delighting in his informal style, his immense charm and his charisma. Thank you so much for asking me for my opinion G\u00e9rard; it dosen\u2019t happen often so I appreciate it very much. Nice to hear from you; thanks again for responding. Looking forward to meeting you someday in Copenhagen. ", "title": "", "parent": "961", "creatorid": "8cd3febe8199", "id": "d2b4894e62d3"}
