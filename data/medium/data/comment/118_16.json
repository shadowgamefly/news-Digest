I also have a brother who is studying in the same college and same stream. We both are studying on educational loan. I have a keen interest in Machine learning. I am currently taking a refresher on Statistics on Udacity taught by Sebastian Thrun. Considering the fact that I know: Python (Between Beginner to intermediate)A rough overview of Machine learning (Did a certified course for it on NPTEL and also I am halfway to Udacity\u2019s Intro to Machine Learning course) Now the main problem is that within 5\u20136 months Campus job interviews will be conducted in my college and I need a job to support my family. I need something to show the employers so that I can get a job as a Data analyst. So, should I go for the Data science A-Z by Udemy or take up the Data analyst Nanodegree?
