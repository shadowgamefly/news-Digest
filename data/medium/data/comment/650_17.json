{"name": "650_17", "child": "", "content": "Ben Hardy, always and consistently, gives a fantastic amount of good advice. But unfortunately some kind of reference to prayer or faith or spirituality always creeps in, with apparent justification. I realise he can\u2019t help his cultural background, and much of the USA is, like the Arab world, mentally stuck in the 15th century. But it\u2019s a bit weird for a psychology PhD not to come smack up against cognitive dissonance (holding two wildly contradictory beliefs at the same time, e.g. \u201cYes there is a fantastic amount of suffering by the undeserving and innocent in the world, and child abuse all over the place\u201d, but at the same time, \u201cThere is a benevolent deity who loves everyone and has the ability to intervene in human history\u201d. He\u2019s just been a bit busy to pay attention to his own Catholic priests and child abuse, or\u200a\u2014\u200aif he was there and could do anything about it\u200a\u2014\u200athe disgusting senselessness of children with brain and genetic damage or cancer.) Skepticism is NOT easy\u200a\u2014\u200afacing up to being an evolved bacterium on a grain of rock around an average star in the meaningless vastness of a universe which nobody who ever wrote a Holy Book understood the scale of. \u201cFaith\u201d is easy\u200a\u2014\u200ayou tell me something, I choose to believe you, I don\u2019t have to care about the evidence, you can now manipulate me all you like, as long as I have the comfort of knowing that, say, a Jewish teacher who was executed as a social nuisance two thousand years ago is actually still alive somehow and cares about me, like a sort of invisible teddy bear I can mentally cuddle without ever ever getting to see or feel or listen to, except in the wilds of my own head.
