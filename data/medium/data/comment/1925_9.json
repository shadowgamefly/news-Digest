{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "d00ab4ee2ece", "content": "Thing is you rarely win championships with player trades. A trade can put you over the top ala 2009 lakers, 2004 pistons, 2006 heat, current cavs team trading for klove (though how much he really helped them in playoffs idk if that even counts). But in past ~25 years I can only think of two teams whose rosters where mostly comprised of assets from trades- the 04 pistons and the 08 celtics, though the celtics had a superstar they drafted in pierce and rondo ended up being really good as well. Pistons had traded for four of their starters, only draftee was prince who was easily the worst player on that team. They always seem to be the exception to any generalization about championships cus their team was built so unorthodox. All the other teams drafted or signed players as FAs. Bulls drafted Jordan, Rockets drafted the Dream, Spurs drafted Duncan, Parker, Ginobli and later Kawhi, Lakers drafted Kobe and signed Shaq, heat drafted Wade then traded for Shaq, later signed Lebron and Bosh, Mavs drafted Dirk, GSW drafted Steph, Klay and Draymond. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising teams don\u2019t want to fork over tons of assets for stars. In the end it always ends up being too much or they find one piece isn\u2019t enough to win. Really you want to be a seller and dump your stars for picks and then draft well, or be a FA destination. Note I\u2019m not counting draft day trades in this cus those are more like trading for a pick when you see a guy is available than trading for the player ala George Hill for Kawhi.
