{"name": "411_13", "child": "", "content": "Great idea and congratulations on designing music software teaching program! I should look into finding an app for piano instructions!! Since you are at the beginning stages you do not want to become too dependent on a software program\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a good addition to your practice routine. It is also best to have a great guitar teacher work with you on a weekly basis\u200a\u2014\u200aat least one hour sessions. Start learning some songs. As you know the teacher would review chord positions, hand positions, intonation, style, and even some music theory. I know this is very helpful when I am working with my piano teacher. Best of luck!
