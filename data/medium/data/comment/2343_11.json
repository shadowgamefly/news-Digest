I agree with your points and, as someone in senior leadership, I try to practice these and improve upon them every day. Often, I fail, but I get back up and keep trying. As with other ideas in your piece, that failure and then trying again also sets an example for the people around me. Good luck as you continue to grow and as you continue to write. As someone else who is also trying to spread my writing, please check out my work here on Medium and share what you like. Thanks again! ", "name": "2343_11"}
