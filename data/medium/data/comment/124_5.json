{"name": "124_5", "child": "", "content": "Couple Things: As others have noted, at this point Curry\u2019s basically a victim of his own impossible to meet peak standards. As good as he\u2019s has played this year, he was never going to repeat what he did last season (especially with KD on the team). Also, It seems like Curry\u2019s entered the LeBron phase of his career, where people are no longer surprised by his excellence and (in fact), take it for granted. Plus, as well as he\u2019s played recently, for the season as a whole, he\u2019s been inconsistent and overly passive at times. Finally, the fact that Curry won the previous two MVP\u2019s is not doing him any favors. Pretty sure the voters want to give it to somebody else (probably Harden) this year, just because of that fact. ", "title": "", "parent": "124", "creatorid": "99ad7e16cbce", "id": "3f737c9e0b04"}
