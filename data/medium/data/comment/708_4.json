{"name": "708_4", "child": "", "content": "That\u2019s a very good summary of human biases and we should all have a list of these on the wall. Though your inferences for designers are a bit too generalised for me. Just one example: Most of us work nine-to-five jobs, because we are uncomfortable with the prospect of working for ourselves What is this insight based on? Your own research? Social studies? Guesswork? How about because they like tackling large complex problems with a mature and diverse design team, something you\u2019re more likely to get at a good size company and when showing up at the same time as co-workers? How to combat biases? Always question your work, never assume you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve started with focusing on the one bias with big implications on my work as a UX Designer - Confirmation Bias. It affects all aspects of research, ideation, design and testing. Key is to never work in isolation and having access to a diverse team with different views, skills and cultural backgrounds.
