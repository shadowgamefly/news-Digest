{"name": "1639_22", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019ve been in the TV news business for 35 yrs. and I\u2019ve worked for every cable news channel in that time period. Fake tabloid \u2018news\u2019 shows like Inside Edition, Current Affair, and Hard Copy back in the \u201880s-early \u201990s essentially ruined the TV news biz. News became a \u2018product\u2019 for profit, not an outlet to inform the public responsibly. Now the biz is so fractured that the average viewer just watches the channel that reinforces their world view. And yes, Fox News has essentially \u2018made up\u2019 news and stories to appeal to their audience for years. And before anyone starts screaming, I am decidedly apolitical\u200a\u2014\u200aI think all politicians on BOTH sides are crooks. There is a memo every day when you get into Fox that you read-it tells you WHAT stories to cover- AND WHAT YOU MUST SAY about said story. Last time I checked, covering news was about uncovering facts and reporting them-NOT cherry-picking stories or issues and putting forth an editorial agenda about how to cover them. There are marching orders daily at Fox about what goes on the channel. MSNBC is decidedly liberal, but there was no daily mandate ordering the employees how to cover the news-neither at CNN. The internet makes it impossible now to get ANY news straight up-there is NO vetting-people just click on stories and assume they are true-that\u2019s how Fox News became successful-their audience assumed since it was on the TV Box that what was being broadcast was TRUE. Truth is, people are lazy news consumers, and won\u2019t take the effort to research and find out if the story is factual, and that\u2019s not gonna change. It\u2019s best to assume that ALL the stories are fake-just turn off the TV and read a book. ", "title": "", "parent": "1639", "creatorid": "eac40325b89c", "id": "8abdb7597e19"}
