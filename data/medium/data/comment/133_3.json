{"name": "133_3", "child": "", "content": "Your last point on James Hanna isn\u2019t fair because it doesn\u2019t take into consideration that TEs can contribute to a team\u2019s success without being receiving threats. Hanna started on STs, but really broke out in 2014. He is a mean blocker, and his play definitely factored into Murray\u2019s success. He\u2019s been banged up in the past two years, but recently signed a 3yr extension. He\u2019s a big part of the Cowboys rushing attack, even if he doesn\u2019t give much as a receiver.
