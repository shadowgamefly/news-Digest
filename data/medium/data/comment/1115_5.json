They are all the same and would rather watch the world burn than to criticize one of their own.\u00a0The problem the Republicans are having is that only half of the country is as stupid as they wish the entire country is. The problem Democrats have is thar racism and misogny are a real thing even if it isn\u2019t overt. The ppl who vote for candidates like King do so out of party loyality and they are willing to shrug off the racist BS ppl like him spew because deep down they agree with it. If you call them on it then your the racist, your not lisening to their concerns, you need to try and empathize with them!\u00a0Not for even a second will I allow myself to give them credit for being anything other than what they are at their core.
