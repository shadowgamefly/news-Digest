{"name": "805_21", "child": "", "content": "Ideally. The goal should be to have some back-and-forth with people to better understand their needs, pains, wants, desires, etc. to determine what specific outcome they want today that they currently don\u2019t have (benefit). Once you\u2019ve identified the benefit, then you want to throw some ideas around about what a solution might look like that would provide that benfit and see if they would be interested in such a thing. Any one of those two things can change your \u201cguess\u201d dramatically (or full out shut it down). So to code anything beforehand could wind up being a total waste of time. The biggest problem in building a SaaS isn\u2019t writing code\u200a\u2014\u200apeople can usually pull that off. It\u2019s almost always a marketing and sales problem. So I advocate that you market and sell before you write code because if you know you can write code but you don\u2019t know if you can market or sell something, you should probably try to remove the unknown variable in that equation first. Hope this helps. ", "title": "", "parent": "805", "creatorid": "55e9fd9a459", "id": "a8371529d67a"}
