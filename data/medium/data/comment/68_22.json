{"name": "68_22", "child": "", "content": "\u2018Jackson signed Melo to a deal that was a few million off of the max and included a no-trade clause\u2026From Jackson\u2019s perspective, the only reason to agree to one is to inoculate yourself from criticism should a trade happen\u2019 I\u2019d always assumed that Jackson agreed to the no-trade clause as an apparent quid pro quo with Anthony. An exchange which in his mind was entirely in his favour because he never had any intention of trading Anthony and saw that extra million-a-year of cap-space as an outright bonus. I also fail to see the logic in your inoculation thesis; it makes a GM look weak and failing rather than blameless if the public decides that the player\u2019s forced a trade, particularly when that player\u2019s already ensured that the GM couldn\u2019t trade him against his will.
