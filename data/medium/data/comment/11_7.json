{"content": "I find it incredible that there are designers who feel threatened by this concept. Having more people within an organization thinking about design not only makes the product better, but it makes a designer\u2019s job easier so they can do greater work. All of the best non-designers I\u2019ve worked with are people who practice design thinking. I think it\u2019s very important that when companies hire engineers and other non-designers who directly touch the product, they let a designer talk to them. The team I\u2019ve been working with recently has taken time to consider how \u201cdesigny\u201d engineering candidates are, which I really appreciate. Basically, I don\u2019t want to work with people who expect me to handle all design thinking at all levels of the product.
