There is no outline that writes itself, that constructs sentences with robotic precision and builds paragraphs with the efficiency of the assembly line; as if the gears and presses\u200a\u2014\u200aand the conveyor belts, pumps, valves and systems\u200a\u2014\u200aof the writer\u2019s warehouse should sort and connect materials\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, the words and sayings, and the proverbs and phrases, and the psalms and songs of the author\u2019s voice\u200a\u2014\u200awith the plug and play ease of flipping a switch, greasing some parts and monitoring the gauges in this industrialized exercise; since no outline, never mind one with the breadth and depth of your signature, can, through a surplus of details alone, enable any person to put pen to paper (or letters to laptop), and have a finished product that is as methodical as it is logical, and as powerful and persuasive as it is eloquent and elegant.  A recipe has no directorial cues for passion, no space for improvisation and no room for interpretation.

Where, if you will pardon my asking and excuse my transition from the metaphor of the factory floor to the controlled chaos of the kitchen, is the artistry and flair? Where is the love of language, and the statements of resolve and purpose? How, in other words, can that scrivener inspire us when we try to prevent him from releasing the beauty and energy of every loop and curve of his cursive writing? How can we savor the dish when everything is bland and generic? Give us a festival with a feast of poetry and prose. Give us the writer in all of his glory.
