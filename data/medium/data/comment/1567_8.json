{"name": "1567_8", "child": "", "content": "Mr. Millhiser, It is not an accident that the Senate is set up the way it is. Imagine living in a state, such as you mentioned, with only 500,000 people, but you were represented by population. Your views would never be heard and your opinions (votes) would be meaningless. The Senate set up the way it is allows everyone to have a say. Besides, the House is set up by population. Tell all the facts, not just the ones to spin your story. Additionally, since the \u201cnuclear option\u201d has been used, we no longer live in a representative democracy. We now live in an oligarchy. The minority no longer has any power, way to protest, or even to be heard. A fundamental cornerstone of our political system has been destroyed. A major step towards an imperial dictatorship has occurred. Beyond that, now that the precedence has been set, little or nothing of any true worth will ever be accomplished. Only partisan legislations will be submitted and enacted. Whenever the minority attempts anything, the simple majority will shut it down. Hope you enjoyed democracy while it lasted. Sincerely, Rick ", "title": "", "parent": "1567", "creatorid": "a43da6520713", "id": "a9a720bf4802"}
