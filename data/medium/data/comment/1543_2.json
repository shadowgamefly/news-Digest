{"name": "1543_2", "child": "", "content": "Gerrymandering has been around for quite some time. I am not sure who gets credit for \u201ccreating\u201d it, but this not a new concept. The Democrats controlled the House and Senate for quite some time, even before Reagan was elected to the Presidency. I agree our system is broken in many ways, but neither the Republican or Democratic party are looking to fix anything. They both just want to take advantage of the rules when they have a chance. Democrats are only complaining, because it makes good political theater, and because it worked against them. Sen. Reid is the one who got rid of super majority rules, that allowed Devos to get appointed. ThinkProgress, Ian Millhiser, and the DNC were not complaining very loudly when the rules benefitted them.
