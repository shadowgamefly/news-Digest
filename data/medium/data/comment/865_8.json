{"name": "865_8", "child": "", "content": "Firstly ignore Ron Collins. Everyone\u2019s entitled to want companionship in life, it\u2019s just how you go about it that not everyone has down to a t (at least you admit to this showing humility, which is probably an alien concept to ol\u2019 Ron). Ron seems like the sort of guy that\u2019s read a few blogs on equal rights and taken away a philosophy fed through his own macho ridden confirmation bias that\u2019s basically the verbal equivalent of him berating and flushing the nerd kids head down the toilet during recess (\u2018being a man is all but illegal to begin with\u2019 please, you\u2019re not fooling anyone with that sexist nonsense Ron). All I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t let anybody make you feel guilty about who you are. So you\u2019re not that good at chatting women up; who cares? Those PUA guys are the real creeps (I mean, basing your whole existence and personality on essentially \u2018tricking\u2019 women into bed is pretty gross and makes you kind of a phony). As long as you\u2019re not purposefully making women uncomfortable and knowing when to walk away that\u2019s fine. It really just comes down to common sense at the end of the day (i.e. approaching a woman in a packed bar, stammering and getting rebuffed; acceptable and you\u2019ll live\u2026approaching a woman alone at night with nobody else around; not acceptable and you should probably rethink your life if you\u2019re doing that). I know it\u2019s a cliche, but just be confident with who you are, as then you\u2019ll find someone who you\u2019ll actually click with. Just try talking to women as you would with anyone and whatever will be will be. ", "title": "", "parent": "865", "creatorid": "818362e134e8", "id": "8a46502308bd"}
