{"content": "Last time I checked, nobody after Oscar Robertson came closer to averaging a triple-double on a season than Harden. That is, if you leave away Westbrook, who will actually do it. Add to that the fact that the Rockets are much more competitive and the fact that Harden got snubbed at least a bit last year, when he didn\u2019t win the MVP-trophy because Steph was more winning than him. This year, Harden is the winningest among the one-man-armies and will probably still get snubbed, just because someone else has similar stats that line up in a fascinating yet arbitrary way? It just isn\u2019t fair. Voting for Harden clearly would be the fair choice. But, then again, if MVP-votings were fair, Harden would have gotten it last year and LeBron would have at least 5 trophies. Might as well just vote for Russ, then\u2026I have a feeling that the Players\u2019 MVP will go to the Beard again, restore some justice and get more and more recognition. MVP vs. Players\u2019 MVP might become a less extreme version of the All-Star vs. All-NBA-juxtaposition. One gets all the glory, the other one\u2019s for real. All that being said, with Westbrook\u2019s latest tear, he is also a close frontrunner in my book right now. Still\u200a\u2014\u200ait just isn\u2019t fair. I feel you.
