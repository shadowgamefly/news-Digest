{"name": "1435_6", "child": "", "content": "Cigarettes were the first exercise of liberal totalitarianism on the American people. The total B.S. of second-hand smoke is part of it, along with the the dishonest pretenses at \u2018taxing cigarettes to reduce smoking\u2019 which are really state-level revenue enhancement. Look, I think there are real concerns for the health of people smoking three or more packs a day, maybe even two a day. For some people it can be a lethal addiction. And I understand frequent-smoking areas have an aroma that can be irritating. But the heartless hostility for smokers, not allowing restaurants to allow smoking, the wind-whipped \u201csmokers\u2019 Siberias\u201d that are more punishment than accommodation\u200a\u2014\u200athis is an appalling, sanctimonious, un-American and unwelcome development.
