{"name": "1561_8", "child": "", "content": "The correct rules of the Senate: Whatever the GOP wants, the GOP gets. If the GOP does not get what it wants, it change the rules until it does get what it wants. And a Constitutional Amendment is a horrible idea. By law (not that \u201cby law\u201d means anything anymore), that can be triggered by a 2/3rds number of states or 2/3rds the membership of both the House and the Senate. The problem is that such a call can easily be interpreted to mean that ANY amendments can be proposed, crafted, and voted on\u2026 not just the one the convention was called for. If 3/4s of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the US Constitution. Right now, the GOP controls 32 states (64%) and has 33 governors (66%). They only need 6 more to control 75% of the US states and that means the GOP is the driving, controlling force of a convention. At this point, amending the US Constitution is either a meaningless exercise or doomed to be controlled by the GOP. ", "title": "", "parent": "1561", "creatorid": "965a8373f291", "id": "cc6cea7b9daa"}
