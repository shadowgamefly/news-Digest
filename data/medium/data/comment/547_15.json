{"name": "547_15", "child": "", "content": "Carrie Fisher is the reason I\u2019m considering ECT. I heard her talk about it openly years ago on a talk show. I\u2019d always loved her, but I loved her more when she talked about her depression and treatment. After years of taking many different kinds of medication, I have reached a point where I\u2019m considering other alternates. Carrie gave me that courage. And like you, I\u2019ve been depressed all my life and am amazed I am still alive. We are survivors, you and I and Carrie and all those who suffer from mental illness. You article made me cry. Thank you for that. ", "title": "", "parent": "547", "creatorid": "2fddf79f1b19", "id": "e07c79acea8f"}
