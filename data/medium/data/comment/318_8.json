{"name": "318_8", "child": "", "content": "Thank you Darius. This couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. I\u2019m starting to realize my expectations are set to a place no human being can ever match, meet, or attain. Forget lofty goals and ambition. I\u2019ve set this stupid (I\u2019m mad at myself and this doesn\u2019t help) goals and for what? To stress myself out? To kill myself slowly? How did this even happen? What I need to work on is lowering my expectations. Unfortunately, it goes against every grain in my body. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve let myself and other\u2019s off some preverbal hook. It feels wrong. But if I can make some progress in this area, maybe, just maybe some of the anxiety and stress will come down.
