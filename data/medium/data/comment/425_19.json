{"name": "425_19", "child": "", "content": "Hi, Doug. I enjoyed your article. Just a couple of clarifications: Expedia is not an aggregator/meta-search, it is an OTA itself. Meta-search engines are sites like skyscanner, hipmunk, trivago and kayak to mention some.At the beginning of the article you make the distinction between OTAs and meta-search engines but later on it seems like you use the terms interchangeably. I note this because the economics between OTAs and meta-search engines are very different: OTAs are transactional and make money taking a cut of whatever they sell you (hotel, car, flight, etc.) while meta-search engines make a much smaller cut if the visitor they send to an OTA ends up buying something over there(referrer fee), i.e. meta-search engines are generally not transactional.
