{"name": "1617_13", "child": "", "content": "The worst thing about this was the rejection of your son as a donor. That needs to\u00a0change. I cannot believe they wouldn\u2019t allow an adult to be a donor in any capacity. He can vote. He is a legal adult. Why\u00a0, oh why, could he not save his mothers life? This was heartbreaking\u00a0. Thank you for sharing\u00a0. As a Nurse, I\u2019ve known our healthcare system is broken for a long time. It\u2019s a system based on greed, just like every other major industry in America. If you don\u2019t have money\u00a0, you probably won\u2019t stay alive when you get sick. I really believe that every problem with the Healthcare industry can be traced back to greed. Somewhere, somehow. The insurance companies make it so hard for so many people. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. For example. Needing to be 21 to be a living donor. In my head I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s about lawsuits\u00a0. But who knows? I am so so sorry. I don\u2019t feel like my country cares about us. The people, the families. The lives. Individual lives that are living with the systems they created. It\u2019s not just our healthcare system that is broke. It\u2019s every system that is here to service the people. Isn\u2019t that weird? Healthcare is supposed to be for us. It\u2019s to take care of us. It\u2019s for us. Easy to forget. Because I can talk to anyone that\u2019s ever been sick or had to try to take care of the sick, and we could all swear we were here for them. It was about us meeting their standards. Us playing by their rules. Us having to work for them. Not the other way around, which it should be. I hope that one day\u00a0, America won\u2019t be broken anymore. I hope that one day, businesses and industries serve the people, not the people serve them. I hope that one day people wake up and fight\u00a0, fight to abolish the policies that allowed the machines ( businesses) to take over. That we take our country back, and create systems that work for us. My heart goes out to all of you. She was a beautiful woman. We lost a light.
