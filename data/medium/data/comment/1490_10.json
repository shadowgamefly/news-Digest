I was ready to do some transcriptions, give them a little twist and post some great conversations. After listening to hours of Oprah, WWF and reruns of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d, There was silence for about 10 hours. The next day radio talk shows played for a couple hours. The only sounds from whoever came through was disgusting bodily noises, a few grunts and mumbles and the cleaning people running a vacuum cleaner. By the third day of recordings, I realized that Trump was gone on a golf week and no one else actually lives there. The only thing of interest was on the final recording when one of the cleaning staff opened an ornate intricately carved and intricately painted antique lacquer-ware wood box with a finely detailed gold embellished lid from the 10th century. When asked why she was opening it, she said \u201csomething smells funny.\u201d She discovered a 2 month old molding, green furry tofu taco with a bite taken out of it. The last words on that final recording were \u201cThat lazy tyrant has no respect for anything!\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1490", "creatorid": "a4aa3e7ef27c", "id": "f6d2c7c1a230"}
