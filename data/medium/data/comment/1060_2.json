{"name": "1060_2", "child": "", "content": "Looking for a culture fit sounds like a euphemism for discriminatory practices. It usually means that outstanding applicants\u200a\u2014\u200aand maybe even the best applicants get rejected simply because they\u2019re the wrong race, age or gender, etc. It would be nice if more companies were mature enough to look past culture fit and at culture contribution instead. But I\u2019m not sure how many companies are ready to shift their thinking about this issue. There\u2019s a closed mindedness prevalent among hiring managers that needs to be overcome. After all you can benefit by collaborating with someone even if they don\u2019t like the same baseball team as you do. And some friendly sports debates in the office could even be fun. Value fit is good\u200a\u2014\u200aif as the other commenter says\u200a\u2014\u200athe company actually practices its stated values.
