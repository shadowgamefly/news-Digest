Would it be more acceptable to you if Anna had asked someone else (presumably one of your white co-workers) to do it instead? I think if anything, this anecdote highlights the inherent problem with hiring for diversity. How can one make the claim that they \u2018care about diversity\u2019 without some way to show it off. From obvious things like \u2018diversity reports\u2019 to more subtle, perhaps even subconscious things, like trying to thrust a minority employee front and center, like \u2018See, we care. Look how empowered this guy is\u201d. The other bit about not getting the position, guess what, this happens to everyone. It sounds like what was needed was a \u2018yes man,\u2019 and your qualifications added unacceptable level of uncertainty into a shitty middle manager\u2019s plan.
