{"name": "350_5", "child": "", "content": "This is the first post, written by you, I have read. I would like to thank you for your candor. Being married to a husband who has cheated, I know how difficult it is to admit the role you played in the destruction of trust with someone you love. It is still difficult for my husband to talk about the why and how of his indiscretions. It is still difficult for me to hear. Yet, we both (sometimes grudgingly) understand being honest about what happened is the only way we can work through it. It has been three years since I first learned he was unfaithful. I did not handle my reaction to the news very well. I did and said things I am certainly not proud of. My whole world was tossed upside down, and I was hell-bent on burning what was left of my marriage to the ground. There was a time, I didn\u2019t think I would survive the emotional turmoil and erosion of trust. Getting to the point where we could both be honest about our feelings and\u00a0actions, with each other and our children, took a long time. It was only after I felt confident I knew all the details, I began to heal. The mere fact I can mention his infidelity, without feeling my chest tighten, is proof I am getting past it. Deciding to stay and work through things has been one of the most difficult things I have ever done. Yet, from this end of the tunnel, I can honestly say it has been worth it. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but for now things are good. Continue to be candid and admit when you are wrong. I believe you and your children are going to be just fine.
