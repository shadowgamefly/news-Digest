As a \u201cbusinessman\u201d Trump has never had to sweat the details, just decide what he wanted done and then turn the task over to those who cared about details. As president his job is to weigh a thousand details and come up with a decision. He is therefore totally out of his element and clueless in this regard. So of course he hates the job of being president. Moreover, all his life, Trump has been exploiting and stiffing folks right and left and hailing buses to run over others, while karma has been holding back it awesome revenge, waiting patiently for him to go a bridge too far. Now as president he has gone a bridge too far, and so all the grief that he has piled upon the world is about to come tumbling down upon his bloated ass. Your piece basically outlines karma\u2019s final destruction of the Donald and how he is feeling it already. This one is going to be hard to top, but you might want to shorten it up a bit.
