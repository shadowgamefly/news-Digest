WTF???? In what sense, on what planet, under the influence of what hallucinogens, could the music of Zeppelin ever be described meaningfully as \u201cexpensive\u201d? What does this even mean? This is a mismatch of adjective and noun like \u201carid swamp\u201d or \u201ctolerant liberalism\u201d (couldn\u2019t resist\u2026) Go back and listen to their early performances on BBC in the sixties, and you find that their music was way more tightly-composed and thoroughly-rehearsed than their megahits of the seventies let on, and that their instrumentations and voicings hardly changed at all from the fundamental jazz/blues structure of, guitar, bass and drums (with occasional Fender-Rhodes or Hammond B3) throughout their career. While Yes was filling the stage with schmancy keyboards, and Pink Floyd filling whole stadiums with pyrotechnics and special effects and flying pigs, Led Zeppelin was playing a slightly-modified updating of Chicago blues hybridized with the folk sounds of the British Isles. One might argue that Jimmy Page\u2019s double guitar or John Henry Bonham\u2019s outsized drumkit plus tympani were \u201cexpensive\u201d, but the music itself was as straight-ahead in rock terms as Count Basie\u2019s was to jazz. I just got done lacerating another FSR author who posted a list of great films about Texas which left me wondering if he\u2019d ever been there; this millennial absurdism above makes me assume, similarly, that its author was born decades after sex, drugs and rock and roll were the ethos of a generation, and has not an earthly clue what he is talking about.
