I don\u2019t like Twitter and I\u2019m taking a break from Facebook, so this is a nice site to spend some time on when I\u2019m not blogging on my own platform. I\u2019m very curious about your funding model going forward. I hate ads and I don\u2019t host them on my own blog, but I tolerate them on sites where they are not obtrusive; I don\u2019t use ad blockers. I just think the general hatred of ads and the prevalence of ad blockers would indicate that a new funding model for the web is way past due.
