Although the outcome of your research is encouraging, I am wondering if the direct question \u201cAre you motivated more by mastery of skill/craft, or motivated more by earning money?\u201d yields socially acceptable answers\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, it can be awkward to say that one is motivated by money. It might be interesting to ask people about their best and worst moments at work, or the event that triggered them into switching jobs. You could then try and find out if those moments and events had something to do with their actual work, the appreciation of their work, or with money?
