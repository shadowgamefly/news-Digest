{"name": "1053_9", "child": "", "content": "I prefer holistic interviews too, but as long as companies and schools get more candidates than they have positions, they\u2019re in the position where they could replace you with any of the ten other people next to you and it wouldn\u2019t make a big difference to their bottom line. I think a bigger problem is that the companies dont effectively communicate their expectations for the skills you\u2019ll need when interviewing with them. Fortunately, any candidate that has the chops to make good software but doesn\u2019t make it through a traditional interview is going to do just fine on their own or in the startup market. Startups aren\u2019t nearly as selective or rigid with their hiring requirements because their bottom line depends more on making a sale or making sure that their company will still be alive at the end of the year. It depends on what you want though, do you want to work on an assortment of interesting projects and go up the ranks of a smaller company, or do you want to work within more narrowly defined job description but with a more stable income? If its the former, then a fast growing startup is right for you, and if its the latter, its going to be one of the bigger companies that just needs someone to fill a chair and do their job.
