It was weird at first because I felt as if I would be disconnected from a lot of people I\u2019ve gotten to know (in a very positive way) via social media. After 1 week, it was hugely liberating to the point I am not sure I will be going back to Facebook at all. What struck me about your piece so much, John, was the idea that many of us have bought into a notion that if we don\u2019t share some cool event to Facebook, it\u2019s as if it never happened. I am trying to rally my friends to do a party where everyone leaves their phones in a box by the door, so we can all just\u2026 you know\u2026 spend time with each other. Some people asked \u201cWell what about photos?\u201d and my answer was \u201cHey, even without photos, it\u2019s not like things didn\u2019t happen!\u201d Interesting to try and shift the pendulum back the other direction now.
