While I think minority rule in the Senate is an overall bad idea, the Dems are opening up a world in which Supreme court justices are all appointed and confirmed by party line votes. Do they really want to go there? ", "title": "", "parent": "1567", "creatorid": "14f8f19f7d9", "id": "f8aab983666f"}
