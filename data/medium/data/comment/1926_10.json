I don\u2019t mind having DWade on the team but he can\u2019t start. He is good for the young guys and Jimmy as well. But you CAN\u2019T have a starting five that can\u2019t shoot!! This is dumb!! We have the roster to compete on a regular basis but Hoiberg doesn\u2019t put them out their enough. Jimmy, McDermott, and Mirotic should be our top three players and get the minutes and shots. We should trade Taj and get some value for him and get more tic for Bobby P. We need to see what we have in him and whether is part of our long term future or we should start looking elsewhere. We have to see what we got. Maybe GarPax don\u2019t want to do that as it might expose some of the moves and picks that they have made. I thought not playing the young guys was a gripe they had with Thibs. It will be interesting to see the rotation on Friday against the Raptors. A good team that will have its starters and be hard to beat without maximizing the talent we have on the roster. ", "creatorid": "fcf810e34094", "name": "1926_10", "parent": "1926"}
