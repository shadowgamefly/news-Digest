But immediately quality suffered, too many things to manage which meant many things could go wrong and we started getting poor customer feedback. Last week, I cut down every new service and went back to ones that would make\u00a0the\u00a0customer\u00a0go\u00a0WOW! In the process we are having to say No to a few customer requests.
