{"name": "1554_11", "child": "", "content": "The biggest group affected by this law is the elderly. People who haven\u2019t driven for a decade or two probably don\u2019t have an ID and probably don\u2019t have a good way to go get one. I have a voter\u2019s registration card. We all do. If it was going to be declared invalid because it doesn\u2019t have a photo on it, there\u2019s a simple and obvious cure for that. Start right now putting photos on all voter ID cards. Voter registration drives need to have a camera involved. There\u2019s no need for one to have to travel 100 miles to some DMV with short hours to do it. Of course, that would be in direct opposition to the point of the voter ID laws, which is to keep people from voting. As to the people who claim that older people would have needed a photo ID to open a bank account, collect Social Security and more, that\u2019s just some crap you made up. In this day and age, you might have to have all that. When we opened those accounts, got a Social Security card, or even a driver\u2019s license, the required documents were a birth certificate and mail. There was even a way for one to get a birth certificate with no ID because a lot of people were born at home and never had one.
