{"name": "606_24", "child": "", "content": "Nice article! At least you didn\u2019t have to put up with \u201cinfinite crunch mode\u201d as in some other companies. I used to work in gamedev for 7 years, as an \u201cengine developer\u201d (from 3d stuff, over memory and streaming optimizations to 3dsmax plugins, back in the days of the first Xbox and the Xbox 360) but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever return. Small companies no longer write their own tech (Unity FTW), gameplay programming isn\u2019t my passion, and I wouldn\u2019t want to work in a \u201cgames factory\u201d either. All the best with your indie projects! ", "title": "", "parent": "606", "creatorid": "6e52fb72f038", "id": "66efc4516648"}
