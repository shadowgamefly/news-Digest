We truly have a Father, who binds up and who heals, I have felt pain and wholeness\u200a\u2014\u200atherefore I testify it is real. What you speak is the truth, And by confession thou art loosed, Healing, strength, grace, and peace Abide with you as your sister you keep. Wild Flower may you blossom and grow, And live in a reality where you truly know, That you are beautiful and you are divine, You are healed, you are whole You were planted for a purpose And pain does not make you weak Your power is in your words You are what you speak Use your talent to speak life Don\u2019t let anyone weaken your heart Whether \u2018he\u2019 returns or remains MIA You remain a unique work of Art.
