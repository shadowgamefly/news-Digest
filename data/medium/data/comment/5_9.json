{"id": "daca87b88e97", "content": "Thanks for the kind words and for taking the time to let me know what you think! I tried to build a case in the first few paragraphs for the movie rating to justify my whole endeavor. But, as I admitted in the story, reviews and trailers offer much more information than a rating. If you don\u2019t freak out at reading minor spoilers, or you\u2019re not on the run, my advice is definitely \u201cGo with the review!\u201d. Your example with the genre preferences is particularly interesting to me because it puts light on the complexity of the rating process. I want to emphasize that when building an argumentation such as that in my story, one has to work with fixed concepts and to idealize the whole process to such a degree that it becomes suitable for statistical modelling. It is just like in the natural sciences, where you isolate a process from the hugely complex environment it\u2019s in to be able to describe it and offer a tentative and approximate description of it. For example, if you described the falling of an object, you might leave out air friction, air velocity, the shape of the object etc. Although I put a lot of effort to build the whole reasoning, my recommendation should be regarded in the same way: tentative and approximate.
