{"content": "Exercise is not the answer to losing weight; you would have to run a dozen miles to lose the calories from just one chocolate sundae! Proper eating is the key. No one needs processed sugars and starches so prevalent in the American diet. Just not eating those two nutritionally-useless items will cause weight loss. Of course, sugars and starches are addictive, so you will have to fight cravings, but very little in life that is worthwhile is gained without some effort. After 2\u20133 months of disciplined eating, you won\u2019t crave sugars and starches anymore. Portion control is crucial also; anything you are served in a restaurant is at least double the amounts that a healthy person needs. Cut it in two, eat only half and ask for a to-go box for the other half. And yes, I have experience in losing weight; I lost 67 pounds by first never eating sugars and starches, then cutting portions of what I do eat. It isn\u2019t easy, but it can be done. It depends on how badly you want to lose weight. ", "child": "", "parent": "16", "title": "", "creatorid": "afbaee667af8", "name": "16_17", "id": "d43084ea607b"}
