{"id": "3266183e2b25", "content": "Thanks Daniel. I\u2019m learning this more and more, and trying to get more designers to realise this is their career path. To evolve past the UI, past the UX, to get involved in the fundamental business decisions that end up on the surface, that form the experience. We should be nurturing and training designers from early on to embrace this potential career path and get them involved in learning the skills to improve their development. We need to help transform designers into facilitators. People that help bring teams into the design discussion. I think in doing so, designers won\u2019t have such an allergic reaction to such comments. ", "creatorid": "a7304a9e652b", "title": "", "parent": "1", "child": "", "name": "1_19"}
