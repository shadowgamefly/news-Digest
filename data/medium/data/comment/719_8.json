{"name": "719_8", "child": "", "content": "Great article! I got your point; regular designers also call themselves \u201cUX Designers\u201d but what it really means when someone calls himself like that is that even if he\u2019s a designer he also studied the \u201cpsychology of the consumer\u201d and other related topics that a simple designer don\u2019t even know they exist\u2026 So I agree with you that the people who write \u201cUI/UX Designer\u201d on their titles they only do so because it is the \u201ctrendy title\u201d (even if they don\u2019t know a shit about UX) but everyone should know that UX is not only \u201cparticipating on the creation of a product\u201d; it is a little bit more complex like: knowing exactly what the consumer needs and after testing and applying lots of techniques\u200a\u2014 get a great and user friendly result. I\u2019m not so sure that UX Designer is a wrong title (I think it is the combination between Interaction Designer and UX Researcher) ", "title": "", "parent": "719", "creatorid": "cd08016ffdde", "id": "bf2df1f808ef"}
