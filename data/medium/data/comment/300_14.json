I used to store all article ideas in evernote initially but it became a little cumbersome to keep a track after a while. So I switched to trello and kept 3 boards for articles which are planned to be written, second for once whose draft is created and third for the ones which were published, which simplified my workflow a little. Recently I also started using coschedule for headline analysis. The point about starting to write early in the morning does resound with me since ideas flow better when we are feeling refreshed with good night\u2019s sleep. However I find writing technical articles more appropriate at night because like majority of developers my productivity in programming or writing about it increases in the night time\u00a0;p ", "title": "", "parent": "300", "creatorid": "de5aacb511c0", "id": "ab38d37418f8"}
