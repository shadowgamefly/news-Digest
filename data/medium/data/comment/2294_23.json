These interests have so undermined our social will and rights as humans that we are literally being feared into our deathbeds or into lives hardly worth living by those we rely on most intimately to help us. All this for the bottom line in a report that shareholders demand be impressive. I\u2019d also like to address the term used \u201cNaturopathy\u201d, even though the definition of the term is quite accurate, the fact that\u2019s its called anything but \u201cMedicine\u201d or \u201cPreventive Treatment\u201d I fear may dissuade some from taking it seriously. The fact is many of these treatments are scientifically based and proven treatments, many with far better track records than chemo or other traditional treatments. There is an ignorance gap here that needs desperately to be filled. We can no longer rely on Doctors or medical experts to give us the advice we truly need. This is a sobering reality, but one we must face and stand up to. Thanks for sharing this story, I\u2019m so happy that your family and you had the courage to stand up and take it upon yourselves to not accept in blind faith the advice from a so called medical expert and did the research yourselves to make the right decision.
