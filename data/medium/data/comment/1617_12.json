The pictures broke me, but they made us all truly see what was going on. When my Aunt was sick with cancer in the hospital, the doctors and staff put her off as well. Not to the same extent, because things didn\u2019t go back and forth with her health as much. But it was as if they didn\u2019t necessarily want her to get better. You are right about one thing. The system is very messed up. Best wishes to you and your family during this time. ", "title": "", "parent": "1617", "creatorid": "f8c37a93773c", "id": "8a6e42519bea"}
