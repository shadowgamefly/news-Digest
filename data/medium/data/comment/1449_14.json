I think it would be a nice surprise for you to know that I have started my writings on Medium a month ago inspired solely by YOUR writings. How about that. Does it make me a fan? Well, it gets deeper than that. I\u2019m am fighting my depression demons for quite a while, and my posts on Medium help me take the load off, so it is therapeutic. In the same time, I want to help people realize they can fight depression and live with it. But you started it all and I just wanted to say thank you. Please, Amanda, check the writings on my profile, follow me, and perhaps just humbly, humbly asking you to follow me on Twitter. Any sign of your response would make a difference, for at least I could reach more people in need. This goes to all of you guys who read this. Thank you. My sincere goal is to reach many with my personal story. Sorry guys, sorry Amanda for hijacking the thread, won\u2019t do it anymore. I promise. Or maybe not. I like your new post, too. P.S. My first post ever bears your name, and is dedicated to you. ", "title": "", "parent": "1449", "creatorid": "9b96abde5489", "id": "c515ba30061c"}
