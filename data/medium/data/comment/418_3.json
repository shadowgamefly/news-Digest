{"name": "418_3", "child": "", "content": "The state of North Carolina has had at least two competing companies laying fiber far and wide for about a year. Yards and streets and sidewalks have been drawn on with bright spray paint\u200a\u2014\u200ayellows, reds, oranges, blues\u200a\u2014\u200ato mark service lines. Grass gets dug up. Things get damaged unexpectedly. This has been happening repeatedly. In my county and nearby counties, the demolition and digging, and subsequent cable installation underground has been the most disruptive part of the process. And from what I\u2019ve heard\u200a\u2014\u200aand seen firsthand\u200a\u2014\u200aan inconvenient and costly part of the process especially when water, electric, and gas lines get cut, or more commonly TV and internet lines sliced. That damage has happened frequently, and not only does it cost money, but it also costs time, slowing down the installation process. The company laying the fiber, or their contractor, has to pay for repairs. Unforeseen expenses, you ask? Yes, most certainly. These service disruptions and demolished yards may have caused a small commotion\u200a\u2014\u200aor when gas lines get cut, a big one. Silver lining? All along, there was the hope\u200a\u2014\u200athe promise!\u200a\u2014\u200aof Google Fiber. But a rumor has been spreading that they may not install in every county we\u2019d hoped for, so some of us will be left out. How bad would that really be? It wouldn\u2019t be bad bad, as in We have lost or a dramatic posturing of Poor, poor us. Honestly, we\u2019d all move on and be okay. It wouldn\u2019t be a loss, but rather, a letdown. We\u2019ve had hope in one company\u2019s marketing and promise, but they may not follow through\u200a\u2014\u200aemphasis on may because it\u2019s still early in the process (or late, considering that digging has been happening for nearly a year) and moreover, it\u2019s just rumors that we\u2019ve been hearing about not getting the service. In terms of letdowns, we\u2019ve seen this before when services we come to value and trust, such as Google\u2019s Reader, come and go. But in this case, and with Google Fiber, some of us won\u2019t even have the chance to at least try it before it disappears since it may not arrive at all.
