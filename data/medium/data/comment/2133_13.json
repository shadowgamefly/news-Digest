Thank you VERY much for linking your article back to mine, I feel honored. You brought up some great points and I love the tips you give men with regards to how they can help women that are suffering. I really like the idea of cooking for them! Listening without offering advice is also a great piece of advice. Also reaching out and just giving the person a hug seems like such a small feat but it means so much to the person who is suffering. Hugs mean, I\u2019m listening and care! This is a great article and I shared it on twitter too. Thank you again. ", "name": "2133_13", "id": "98254af90193"}
