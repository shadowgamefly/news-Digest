Otherwise I loved everything else about \u201cHacking the Attention Economy.\u201d I just don\u2019t see the 2016 election as a sign the media were being played; that would suggest they\u2019re bystanders, or somehow victims. No, the big media is exposed: their bias is collusion. The media are so often reliable for the Democratic party, such that they undermine their own credibility. For example, which network was it that gave Hillary\u2019s team a list of debate or interview questions in advance? Whether that\u2019s fair play or not, Trump\u2019s team succeeded in smearing her and the media with that. They own their bias now. How many times did the media\u200a\u2014\u200athe morning talk shows, the cable comedy hosts and evening talk shows\u200a\u2014\u200abasically say, Ooh, please Trump, please run, because you\u2019re an idiot and you\u2019ll show the world what morons the conservatives are? Then Hillary can win and this two party charade where we pretend to listen to both sides can be over for another four\u00a0years. The media owns Trump. They weren\u2019t played. From the vantage point of hacking, they tried to hack the election, setting up a podium for Trump to give Hillary an easy win. Well, they failed and it\u2019s democracy that got played because now we have Trump in the executive branch for four years. Remember the TV media pundits on election night? Their mouths agape over Hillary\u2019s \u201cblue wall\u201d crumbling as blue states turned red for Trump. What crumbled much earlier was her party\u2019s and the TV network\u2019s credibility: the decay only became starkly visible on election night. You don\u2019t have to be a Trump supporter (I\u2019m not one) to see what he did there and continues to use Twitter and his YouTube-first media briefings to do. He\u2019s not giving the media any legs. But whom do we trust now? An algorithm? Facebook and Google? Their biases were also exposed during the 2016 election: Facebook\u2019s algorithm for hiding real conservative news is arguably worse than Facebook\u2019s algorithm that is the dry grass fueling the next fake news wildfire. And Google is no better; Schmidt as an openly supporting Hillary is fair game, he\u2019s a person with an opinion, but when Google Search hid negative search results about Hillary\u2019s health or scandal du jour, well that smells like media collusion. So people, like Dana Boyd, the author of this Medium post, are going to credit Trump as being a master media attention hacker. Whether it\u2019s that or that the right succeeded in exposing media and tech company bias. Either way the TV networks and big newspapers have a lot of credibility to earn back. I\u2019m hoping this is a good thing. I\u2019m hoping journalism goes back to reporting facts and exposing corruption of any party or corporation or government instead of protecting one political ideology from another.
