{"name": "1883_20", "child": "", "content": "My dear, young Mr. Quarles, Your intellect, self-awareness, courage, and dignity shine as brightly as a just minted coin. If ever there is a time to be brave and bold, it is your now. I pray that your total life experiences turn you into a tiger. With age, it is hoped, comes wisdom. I have walked in your shoes (though, they were high heels) scores of times over the decades. Your travails, observations, and actions are cautionary ones. Almost certainly, similar experiences await black folks who are (younger, young, old, older, and damn near dust) socially conscious and unconscious alike. Caveat with your advice: Not all black folks are warriors who can fight (or not) and simply walk away. Some, just as exceptional, can longer endure the horrors and should and must report them back to the B-Hive (reflective bank of elder, peer, etc. knowledge, experience, tools, advice, and support), as I like to think of it. Those not equipped with the tools of battle, may be felled by the hits. The B-Hive should swarm in to help repair the damage. But first, we must build the B-Hive and be careful where we keep the keys. We have much work to do. Especially, in light of Trump\u2019s win. Much hope, love, and prayer young warrior.
