Wasn\u2019t that an education they were coming for? Truth based on authority is nonsense, and all religions do is postpone the day when folks can reason using sense. As for this religion in particular, it claims women are guilty for tempting men and must cover up. Every single woman dressed as a Muslim is announcing her support or submission to the idea that women, not men, are guilty for rape. Keep that sort of nasty, perverted nonsense away from schools, please. ", "title": "", "parent": "1108", "creatorid": "db1ca5cd6b2b", "id": "6330d7b2c864"}
