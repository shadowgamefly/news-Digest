FTA: \u201cThe Array of Things is not counting MAC addresses on smartphones\u201d The government doesn\u2019t need to count MAC addresses to see where one is or has been. They already have access to the phone location data from your friendly cell phone provider. Plus anyone with an Android or iOS product in their pocket is extremely likely to already be sharing the same with those respective companies. However, this array could (and should) track MAC address propagation from an area to the next to see how fast traffic (vehicular and otherwise) is moving. Sounds to me like the illusion of preservation of privacy is preventing such a feature from being implemented. FTA: \u201cThe image from the camera never gets stored or transmitted\u201d Yes. And a few lines of code can change that. Isn\u2019t this the city that wanted a camera on every other light pole? Or was that only for those neighborhoods that were not quite as equal as others? On the upside the network is unlikely to have the bandwidth for wholesale image propagation, though the processing capabilities are likely sufficient for reasonably decent facial recognition (and that wouldn\u2019t take \u201cstoring\u201d or \u201ctransmitting\u201d images).
