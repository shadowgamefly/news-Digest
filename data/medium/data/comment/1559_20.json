{"name": "1559_20", "child": "", "content": "You need to STOP spreading the lie that voter ID is about preventing any specific \u201cracial\u201d group from voting; it\u2019s about blocking those not ELIGIBLE to vote only; regardless their race, religion, or other divisive labels! Blacks manage to get IDs to get on welfare well enough, so they CAN get them when there\u2019s a will to do so; ergo, they can get them to vote as well. As for the rest of your \u201crant\u201d, MANY of us who are CITIZENS in the US as well would WELCOME such relief from the onerous and destructive policies that SCOTUS has been pushing the past decades! Religious freedom includes the right to live by our consciences; that means if we choose to NOT participate in a specific practice, we have that GOD-given right to not do so; as does a black man who declines to participate in a KKK event or a Jew who declines to participate in a Nazi event! It IS discrimination against that EVENT, not a person! And all have a right to NOT be sued for their consciences and beliefs! The real discrimination in these issues is coming from the perverts who see and gain easy money; it\u2019s not about their \u201cfeelings\u201d being hurt, because someone said \u201cno\u201d; they just love to hate.
