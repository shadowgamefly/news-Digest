{"name": "1376_13", "child": "", "content": "I think I am probably not as naive as you think I am. I have little hope that asking people to do the right thing will result in their responding to it. But I still believe in doing it. The spirit intended was a friendly one, and your response seems to get that. No, you are not naive. I tend to block truly naive people because I find them annoying and dangerous. Someone who is not truly naive can taking being told they are acting it, and benefit, or at least I hope so. And I may not be as cynical, in fact I know I\u2019m not, as what I project online. This is an unreal world and I take my place in it as a sort of attempted artist, arting by my own rules and in my own style, which is to be the guy who filters out people worth talking to by roughing everyone up a bit in a venue prone to unnecessary roughness anyway. Congratulations: you take me well, consider yourself duly and affectionately roughed-up. As one who can take me as she finds me, I will go on and do you the further honor of saying I agree with most of what I was responding to. I just have (ask anyone) rather a back-handed way of agreeing with folks, especially the ladies. A bit of loving rivalry between the sexes is the healthiest set of manners I have found yet for everyone to retain a sense of holding their own. I have a thing I inherited from my dad and his both, of getting a lady to smile by poking a little friendly fun. It drives my mom out of her mind and always has, and after sixty-plus years together she still makes him pay for it, and he pays. And pays and pays, believe me. It is, I find, the height of male contentment, to get a lady to smile, and as often as not, by any means necessary. ", "title": "", "parent": "1376", "creatorid": "bdc93f756837", "id": "8a38fa9a77b4"}
