But like you said, \u201cIt\u2019s the letting go that is the toughest part and the most necessary.\u201d \u201cLife is about being of service to others.\u201d I can\u2019t agree enough. Sometimes service is just being there. Listening, smiling\u2026 being silly. Connection is so very important to me, much more than actual things. People are truly simple beings.
