{"name": "1735_18", "child": "", "content": "So true, who you are and your \u2018passion\u2019 is all about where you actually put your energy and attention into. When I was much younger and still trying to figure out \u201cwhat I wanna be when I grow up\u201d, happened to take some career counseling and aptitude tests. One of the tests featured a series of bar graphs divided into different areas of life, that measured where I currently invested my energies, compared to most other folks around my age. It included areas like \u2018business\u2019, \u2018politics\u2019, etc., and my results showed a \u2018yooge\u2019 spike in one area generally called \u201caesthetics\u201d, which included everything from music and poetry to the visual arts. And when I looked around in my life, sure enuff without even being aware of it, the Arts and Design were heavily influencing most of my attention, from what I bought and read, to even decorating my house (hey, young guys gotta have a \u2018cool pad\u2019 to \u2018get the chicks\u2019\u2026lol)! But long story short, that one \u2018visualization\u2019 immediately put me on the path to my future \u2018calling\u2019 as a Commercial Artist and Designer. And looking back now from the \u2018wisdom\u2019 of retirement, it proved to be the best decision I ever made. ", "title": "", "parent": "1735", "creatorid": "81cff532d75b", "id": "cd4d8f600477"}
