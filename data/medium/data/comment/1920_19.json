However, it unclear whether Chau is endorsing the idea that, to deserve the MVP trophy, a player must have a \u201cMVP moment\u201d towards the end of the season, or whether Chau is merely pointing out that, due to voter recency bias, a player must have a late-season \u201cMVP moment\u201d or else he won\u2019t get votes. I hope it\u2019s the latter, because the idea that Westbrook\u2019s case for MVP is that he was able to put up staggering numbers against an Orlando that is TRYING TO LOSE FOR THE LOTTERY is ludicrous. Although I\u2019m cynical enough to believe that certain MVP voters (including at least one that works for the Ringer) are easily swayed by statistically impressive late season victories over lottery teams, I hope Chau isn\u2019t endorsing that as a primary factor that should be considered when voting.
