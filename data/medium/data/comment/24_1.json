{"content": "How is it a good thing for an individual award, that the management and coach tailored players around you to specifically show your strengths? Isn\u2019t the Steve Nash example actually arguing in favor of anti-harden? Basically, you can put any great player on Mike d\u2019antoni team, and he will design the team in a fashion that will showcase his skills to the public. (And now People say it\u2019s absurd that Nash won the MVP twice, largely because of d\u2019Antoni\u2019s offense). Give Russ, D\u2019antoni and Daryl over some random college coach, and I\u2019d be shocked if they didn\u2019t do miracles like turn Raja Bell into a defensive wundekind or Eric Gordon into sixth man of the year. Dantoni for coach of the year. Russ for MVP. ", "child": "", "parent": "24", "title": "", "creatorid": "bb916b6ff17d", "name": "24_1", "id": "8c07b4a6b4df"}
