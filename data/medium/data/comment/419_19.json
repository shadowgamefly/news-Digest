I\u2019ve been a customer of their Google Fiber service for the past four months, and they\u2019ve done something pretty ingenious with the home network: integrated it into the TV infrastructure. Each TV, naturally, has a set-top box (STB) that gets it\u2019s signal via our home\u2019s coaxial cable wires directly from the fiber termination point on the side of the house. The primary WiFi router is their network box \u2013 which is an all-in-one device that acts as DVR, network storage appliance, Ethernet hub, and WiFi router. Each STB, however, is a ubiquitous WiFi access point, too. Each uses the same network name and settings, and the system even monitors the signal each box receives and turns them on and off based on signal strength, transmission quality, and available bandwidth. The STBs also each have an Ethernet port on them, allowing either a single device (such as a gaming system, Apple TV, or digital assistant) or an Ethernet hub (permitting multiple devices) to be wired directly into the network \u2013 extremely helpful for bandwidth-intensive applications like video streaming or gaming. Finally, as you\u2019ve suggested, nothing is managed at the device anymore. The only option I get when I punch in one of the Google Fiber devices\u2019 IP addresses is the option to reboot that device. All the settings and administration is done on the Google website \u2013 which took me quite by surprise since I\u2019ve not tried Eero, Plume, or their brethren prior to this. From left to right, my Google Fiber Network box, Telephone Interface, and a Set-Top\u00a0Box As you indicate, this trend seems to be the next logical step, and after living with it for several months now, it\u2019s actually nice to see the WiFi network fade into the managed background. I haven\u2019t had to worry about signal strength, a dead spot, or bandwidth problems since Fiber\u2019s installation. In fact, the only time I have to think about WiFi is when friends visit and I need to share the network deets \u2013 and Google\u2019s even managed to simplify that experience: I supply the system their Google ID (email address) and how long I want them to have access, and Google sends them a temporary network identifier and password that expires when I indicated, with no further thought on my part. (And to address the worries of those oddly concerned about the net neutrality war within their own walls: my iPhones and MacBooks work amazingly on my Google network.) Having seen this emerging trend in WiFi firsthand, I\u2019m pleased with the experience. I can\u2019t wait until future devices connect themselves without user intervention to a network whose name is simply an unintelligible system-generated string of characters that I need have no direct influence or control over.
