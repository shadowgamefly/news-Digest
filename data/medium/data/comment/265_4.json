{"name": "265_4", "child": "", "content": "Eduardo Atjian II Thanks so much for taking the time to share your story. The one thing I\u2019ll say is this: As much clarity as I\u2019ve found and as much as I\u2019ve learned, I wouldn\u2019t say that I have it all figured out. I don\u2019t know if any of us ever do. Life is always changing and we\u2019re emotional people. The best advice I could ever give is to try as many things as you can in your first several years out of college (sounds like you, so you\u2019re on the right track). Then, start realizing the things you\u2019re good at. What skills do you have? What do you do well? Once you have your list, look at those things and measure them up against what you have a passion for. What do you love to do? I think the best part of life is finding what we love to do most, melding that with what we have natural talent, and skills for, then marrying those things together. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll find greater fulfillment, peace and clarity. Good luck! ", "title": "", "parent": "265", "creatorid": "f727d386ef85", "id": "6f74e8652fa7"}
