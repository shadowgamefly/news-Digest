{"name": "623_3", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts on reading and learning through the lens of Ray Bradbury. Your words have reignited my waning passion for reading. For the first time in my adult life, I began reading vigorously (not assigned reading) after my second encounter with Fahrenheit 451 in 2015. I was eager to learn, relentlessly chasing after knowledge, after wisdom. I wanted to know more about this world through the works of great minds before our times. Summer, autumn, winter, spring. One book after another and another, reading became a habit I can not live without; it also became a mindless activity. I gave up the pleasure of reading to my pride, the preposterous fulfillment seeking ego. Why I read was to stack up as many read books as fast as possible. I wasn\u2019t satisfied and I wasn\u2019t learning, then your words woke me, \u201c\u2026, no one should ever think of writing or reading as suffering. It\u2019s fucking magical,\u00a0\u2026\u201d. I forgot how magical it was to read, communicating with and learning from writers through their words. Now I remember why I read. I read for knowledge, inspiration, and pleasure. Thank you again. Cheers. ", "title": "", "parent": "623", "creatorid": "855186c5c64b", "id": "6b482d4e31ab"}
