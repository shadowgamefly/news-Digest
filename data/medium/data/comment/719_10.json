I\u2019ve been doing and managing things that cluster around \u201cUX\u201d since the titles were \u201cWeb Designer\u201d and \u201cWeb Master.\u201d At times I\u2019m not sure whether the clarity of titles has gotten better or worse since then. There\u2019s so much tied up in a title\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s how you and others define your scope of responsibility and job duties, it\u2019s how you talk to others in your peer group about what you do, it\u2019s how you market yourself, it\u2019s how employers find and market to you\u2026etc. In each of those contexts, there\u2019s a different need for a title to convey something meaningful.
