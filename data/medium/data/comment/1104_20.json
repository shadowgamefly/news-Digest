{"name": "1104_20", "child": "", "content": "This is the conundrum of the right wing Christian. They profess to believe in the bible and the teaching of Jesus, and pray for his return. The bible says that Jesus will not return until the anti-Christ creates the apocalypse and tribulations described in the book of Revelations comes. If they truly believe that the liberals are setting the stage and they are praying for Jesus to return, they should be the most liberal individuals in the world. The very fact that they are ultra-conservative and fighting the end of the world proves that they can not be Christian. A true Christian teaches what Jesus said, preaches repent and make yourself ready for the end times, and prays hurry lord Jesus!
