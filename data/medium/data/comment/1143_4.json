Yet, I do know you, fellow human, grief survivor who is still swimming in that sea of tears. Swim for as long as you need too, howl as much as your body insists you do. Please also love yourself as Gery loved you and along with the laughs at the funny / fun memories, soothe and smooth yourself. I am sorry to give you advice, I know you are doing what you need to do. I just hope that you will be kind to you. With love. ", "title": "", "parent": "1143", "creatorid": "19ead915faa7", "id": "f567f7fc01c7"}
