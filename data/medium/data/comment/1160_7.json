{"name": "1160_7", "child": "", "content": "The further north (or south) you are of the equator, the more that DST makes sense. Without DST the sun would be rising by 4:00 am here (just above the 45th parallel). We could always just get up an hour or 2 earlier to make more use of that time of sunshine, but DST synchronizes everyone. Closer to the equator there is less of a range of day length through the year so the benefits of DST would be lower. While there are some effects of time change, there are many benefits as well. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I enjoy having the extra summer sunshine in the evening rather than sleeping through it in the morning.
