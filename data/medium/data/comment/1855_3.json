And we owe it to ourselves to pay it forward by caring for others and showing this through our work, our lives and our convictions. As God has loved and cared for us, so we show that love to others by our writing and convictions and lives. I care because people have cared for me and I care for your work and I am glad you care for mine too. Thanks for this pithy and truly insightful write-up Christopher!
