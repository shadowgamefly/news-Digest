{"name": "69_1", "child": "", "content": "The Knicks lost again to Clippers because D Rose is a low IQ, indecisive, turnover prone, Point Guard and fails to execute a team offense in the 4th Quarter. Brandon Jennings is a more true PG wo should close out games due to his tenacious D, passion to WIN, confidence, ball movement and 3 point shooting. Also, Phil Jackson may know talent and team building, but he appears to be a very weird, weak people skills type guy to be a President. His days may be numbered, unless Dolan still trusts Phil, agrees that Melo\u2019s 25\u201327 million contract is not worth it anymore, and they must rebuild around KP, Willy etc?
