In fact, our \u2018privilege\u2019 pails in comparison to the real privilege of those in the finance industry.

Instead I have decided to try to provide real value to people through the craft of software development. ", "title": "", "parent": "1882", "creatorid": "bcd36bd590b6", "id": "ac99d9a885e3"}
