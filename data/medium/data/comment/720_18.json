{"name": "720_18", "child": "", "content": "Hi Khalil, thanks for reading the article! For any design project, I think it\u2019s important to understand who you are designing for. This is where creating a persona becomes useful. You\u2019ll notice in my persona that I was designing for a younger audience that was comfortable with technology and familiar with booking travel online. Since many travel sites use radio buttons as a means for selection and tabs as a means for navigation, I decided to incorporate those components into my design. If I were designing for an older, less tech-savvy audience, I may have simplified the design (i.e. reduced the cognitive load on each screen). I agree I could have added a little more color to that persona section, but hopefully this helps! Michael ", "title": "", "parent": "720", "creatorid": "be96c24a4df4", "id": "fd28174bb686"}
