Can\u2019t believe there was no mention of the 0\u20138 cavs record when he doesn\u2019t play. Can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t mention the ON/OFF net ratings argument with Lebron at +16, Russ at +12, Leonard at +2, and Harden +1.5. Nowhere does he even bring up that the Cavs starting SG missed half the season. JR hit 200+ 3s for the cavs last season. Their starting PF had mid season surgery on his knee and really didn\u2019t start looking ok until about this last week. His second best star is a huge defensive liability and we\u2019re still not sure he makes anyone better. They\u2019re the defending champs so they get everyone\u2019s best effort most nights. Oh by the way he still kept them afloat as a two seed in the conference. We have high expectations for the cavs like they are the warriors but they don\u2019t have a well oiled machine. Kyrie isn\u2019t the difference maker KD, Steph, Draymond are. Lebron has more to play for than Westbrook and Harden who will most likely have quick exits, so he can\u2019t quite empty the tank as the those two have. And if you want to look at his stats, he averaged 26 8.6 8.7 on 55% FG and 36% 3P%. The only guys to average at least 20 8 and 8 with 50% shooting or better were Magic, MJ and Wilt. Lebron just joined them. I also believe he is averaging the most assists ever for a forward. Points per game combined with points created by assists are the following: Harden 29 ppg 27 APC 35% usage Westbrook 31 ppg 23 APC 42% usage James 26 ppg 22 APC 30% usage Leonard 26 ppg 9 APC 31% usage ", "creatorid": "d18108102208", "name": "1917_8", "parent": "1917"}
