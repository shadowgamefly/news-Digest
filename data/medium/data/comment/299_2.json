These days, I post 4\u20135 times and come up with 40\u201350 ideas a week. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s work. For the longest time, that work was wasted. Why? I didn\u2019t have a system. My writing efforts had literally become the hamster on an endless wheel. Since Kyle came into my life, I\u2019ve tripled my email list size. What does that mean to you? Probably nothing. What it means to me is I have a larger platform to distribute work I am infinitely passionate about. It means the wheel is broken and now I\u2019m tearing down an open road. Thanks Kyle, for this exercise. (I\u2019m using a post-it notes, btw. Couldn\u2019t find a notecard.) ", "title": "", "parent": "299", "creatorid": "7e13af5e3c36", "id": "376ccf032cd6"}
