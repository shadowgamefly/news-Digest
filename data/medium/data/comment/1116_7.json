{"name": "1116_7", "child": "", "content": "It\u2019s a bad thing when people no longer feel safe in an environment that was created for them to feel safe in. Having said that though\u2026 I don\u2019t think that this should be framed as an assault on a group because they were LGBT. It\u2019s ambiguous as to why the suspect acted out. According to the author, the person had previous visits and had acted out in anger during some of those visits. We do not know the reason for his anger. I\u2019m sure if the suspect had shouted out a derogatory remark about anyone\u2019s sexuality, it would have been mentioned in the story. I feel that this is an unfortunate incident at a place that happened to be a LGBT youth community center and shelter and not because of what it is. I wish we didn\u2019t need safe house, that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, no matter their sexuality, gender, nationality, religion or any combination there of. Stand up for who you are, fight back when needed, but be careful when you accuse someone of something that they are not. You do not want to look in a mirror and see your enemy looking back.
