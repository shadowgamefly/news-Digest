It\u2019s humanity\u2019s free will that allowed us to choose the easier, uglier path that led us where we are today. So what I try to do is change the fundamental choices we make by trying to change the options we limit ourselves to. I strongly believe in doing as much as I possibly can and getting as many people as I can to join me in designing a more attractive world where people will feel better just by looking at it. This way, decisions that will cause detriment to that beauty will be met with mental resistance since it will make the experience less satisfying and pleasurable. Hopefully, with humanity\u2019s incredible adaptability, if this is continued by entities with enough influence, a better world may start to evolve.
