Who the FUCK did you piss off that you feel like you need amotherfucking MILITARY RIFLE that can shoot \u201c As no modern military force anywhere on the planet issues semi-automatic rifles as standard, you can\u2019t call an AR a military rifle. During the \u201992 LA riots, Korean shop owners banded together with semi-automatic rifles to defend their shops against hundreds of looters stealing and firebombing through Koreatown, which was abandoned by the LAPD because it was deemed for unsafe for officers. Who did these shop owners piss off? What life choices did they make to incur this onslaught? In 2010 a Houston 15 yr old defended his 12 yr old sister and their home from a pair of armed home invaders with an AR-15. Who exactly _did_ his sister piss of to need that rifle to protect her? What exactly _did_ this guy do that he had to fend off 4 armed invaders? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_rz2wBYin4 And what nefarious activity must this Detroit mom be into to need an \u2018assault rifle\u2019 to protect her home and children from three armed invaders?  And imagine the horrific crimes committed by this family to need to defend themselves from 13 armed robbers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-OIlbVggR0 ", "child": "", "id": "5b47ced369e2", "title": ""}
