Not more money per month, just more often. I already make an extra payment when I get my tax return and if I split my monthly payments and just pay half a monthly payment every paycheck, then at the end of the year I\u2019ll have made another extra payment (2 months with 3 paychecks) and since I have ~20 years left to pay, in 12 years I\u2019ll have paid off 2 additional years with no extra pain in my budget. This also won\u2019t include paying more when salary increases happen etc (I\u2019m also increasing the total amount I pay each month by $100 now). Am I missing something here? How did I never think of this? Will this come back to bite me in the butt? ", "creatorid": "352933fd661d", "timestamp": 1488550620925, "child": "", "username": "PicNicole"}
