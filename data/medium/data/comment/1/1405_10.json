This is useful information that is relevant to what I intend to accomplish in the future. I intend to start my self-publishing business in the summer of 2018. I plan to publish my first book before the end of 2017. I have an idea of how the first book will be set up. It will be a poetry book in which each chapter would cover a different topic/subject matter. I have been writing poetry since 12 or 13 years of age. I have written about many topics from police brutality to experience with exclusion and ostracism to veganism to hair journey to water to melanin to women empowerment to love for women. This article is thoroughly explained, honestly speaking. ", "creatorid": "640e0007c557", "id": "3906f52b769e", "child": "", "title": ""}
