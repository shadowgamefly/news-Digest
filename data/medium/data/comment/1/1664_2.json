I lived in Akron for 25 years and I\u2019m a die hard Ohio State fan. I\u2019m still not going to pretend like Ohio State (even at the height of its powers) is likely to beat Alabama. I believe that the only way Alabama loses in the playoff is if there\u2019s some crazy plague of injuries or if Alabama just has one of those crazy days that happen in sports sometimes where a team doesn\u2019t play its best game. Unfortunately for my championship hopes, though, the Nick Saban version of Alabama is remarkably consistent. Maybe we should go to a European-style relegation system. The Crimson Tide can be promoted to the NFL and the Browns should be relegated to the NCAA. It would *totally* work! (Here\u2019s a fun thought: If the Browns had, for example, Florida\u2019s schedule this year, do you think that they would make the playoff? I don\u2019t.)
