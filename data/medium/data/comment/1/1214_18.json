I marked the carrot for later No 20,The No 2 would\u2019ve been my Runner Up if it hadn\u2019t been the naked truth, just to complete: including interest he owes the Kushners the exact amount of $ 3\u00a0,885,967,421.84 (current state April 11, 2017).So, my Runner Up is, of course, Anatoly Putnnnnn\u00a0! I marked him for No 19\u00a0\u2026My bronze medal goes to No 14, ya know 1 (ONE) semester Matriculation doesn\u2019t say nothing, but in hindsight to the rest of the pack you\u2019re right: Indispensable expert\u00a0!And now MY Highlight No 19, for I see you are not aware that Anatoly Putnnnnn was the producer AND director of the \u201cGolden Shower\u201d videotape, and btw, also not known to the public, there exists an entire series: \u201cGolden Rinse 1\u201d, \u201cGolden Splash 2\u201d, \u201cGolden Shower 3\u201d, \u201cGolden River 4\u201d, \u201cGolden Retriever 5\u201d and \u201cGolden Sea 6\u201d\u00a0!! All sponsored and directed by Anatoly Putnnnnn\u00a0! MY ABSOLUTE ALL TIME FAVORITE\u00a0!For No 20 you know that the Kushner\u2019s are renaming \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Dildo\u201d to 660 Fifth Avenue, furthermore the demolition will start in 2019 (once the project is sanctioned) and the planned construction will be complete in 2025\u00a0\u2026\u2026 where will The GreLaT be in 2025 after impeachment and next bankruptcy\u00a0? You know, First when I read about Lyin\u2019 Donnie Twitler\u2019s new contract with the devil, I know 666\u00a0\u2026 I thought you were speaking of \u201cThe Dakota\u201d, 1 West 72nd Street, first for \u201cPolanskis baby\u201d and second for the co-op BOD of this building rejected in 2011 for racial reasons (Orange skin\u00a0!) The GreLaT\u2019s plans to buy an 5th floor appartment\u00a0\u2026 Lyin\u2019 Donnie sued, board members fought back, saying in depositions they had rejected Mr. Donnie T. because \u201che had only \u00a7 50,000 in liquid assets, millions in debt and mounting losses in his businesses\u00a0\u2026\u201d! In 2015 a judge finally sided with the board saying there was not enough evidence of discrimination of Orange Donnie\u00a0\u2026 So\u00a0\u2026. but that\u2019s a story for its own\u00a0! p.s. you know this already\u00a0? https://www.wired.com/2017/03/the-comedy-of-politics/ Karallan p.p.s.
