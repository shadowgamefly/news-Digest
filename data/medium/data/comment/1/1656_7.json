Its top-heaviness is what made it appear that it was much stronger than it was. Alabama has definitely been WAY better than any other teams, and in various years LSU, Florida, and Auburn have been just as good. But the rest of the teams are barely better than your average or maybe above average ACC/Big12/Big10 teams. The dominance of the SEC was based on 2 or 3 teams being a LOT better. The proof was in the fact that Mizzou and A&M both did very well as soon as they joined. They were both long-time 2nd tier (just below OU, Texas & Nebraska) Big 12 teams and yet Missouri won the SEC East while A&M beat Alabama and had a Heisman winner right away. They did not have to wait for an influx of SEC talent or coaching or any other magic. They were Big 12 teams that were just as good as the above average SEC teams right away.
