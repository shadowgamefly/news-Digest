I thought\u00a0.NET WinForms & C# was a good incremental improvement. However, I thought that ASP.NET was a POS, but it still was better than the whole HTML/XML/Javascript stack. Javascript is a hokey little language that is so painful to program that everyone wants to abstract away the pain, and the pain is so all-encompassing that these abstractions are in a constant state of update (as the author has pointed out). And because Javascript\u2019s stack\u2019s features grow with each browser\u2019s very rapid releases, any detailed knowledge grows stale very quickly\u200a\u2014\u200awhich forces folks who professionally program in Javascript to spend an inordinate amount of time just learning ephemeral stuff just to be marketable. AIUI, there seems to be a new stack on the horizon called WebAssembly, which seems to be a well-designed language (or whatever it is) and something that can bring some order to the chaos that is the Javascript world. (BTW, I had decided to \u201cearly retire\u201d rather than get into that Javascript chaos.) ", "creatorid": "60c488077411", "timestamp": 1490479788370, "child": "", "username": "swampwiz"}
