It seems pretty straightforward that a team\u2019s \u201cresume\u201d is a combination of their record, how tough their schedule was, and whether or not they won their conference. \u201cGame control\u201d or \u201cwhen did the win happen\u201d or \u201cbut their QB was limping for the second half of that one game\u201d are all arguments that have no place in deciding the outcomes of any other respected sport that I can think of, and we don\u2019t need it here. I made a simple algorithm combining record, strength of schedule, and a bonus for conference championship and it produced this result (score in parentheses): Alabama (95.7%)Clemson (83.6%)Ohio State (80.8%)Washington (80.6%)Penn State (75.4%)Oklahoma (74.0%)Michigan (70.4%)W Michigan (68.0%)Wisconsin (62.3%)USC (60.6%) Looks fair enough, right? And it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201csecret formula\u201d and there\u2019d be no concern of coaches \u201cgaming the system\u201d (they\u2019re just rewarded for winning). Wouldn\u2019t this be a lot more fair? What am I missing? ", "creatorid": "371073e50d49", "id": "397d9c3b7a2b", "child": "", "title": ""}
