Just curious if you have legal background to support those interpretations. In particular, your point #7\u200a\u2014\u200aI am not a lawyer, but based on other instances of people being ordered off aircraft (including the really obnoxious \u201cthis foreign looking person next to me makes me nervous\u201d), I\u2019m guessing the Courts have granted wide latitude to the airlines to make a determination. The other point that I\u2019ve read elsewhere is the airline has not just a moral, but a legal obligation to do everything reasonably possible to fly a scheduled flight. Under those terms, the need to get a flight crew to another location to make that flight (and the associated thought that \u2018keeping 50 people from getting to where they\u2019re going is worse than keeping 4 people from getting to where they\u2019re going) would seem to be a legitimate reason to bump a revenue passenger. (And I\u2019ve been in the situation where I got into an argument with ground crew when onboard the aircraft. I was told, \u201cIf you want to discuss this more, you need to leave.\u201d I got up, gathered my stuff, exited the aircraft, booked a flight home on another airline, and then had an extensive discussion with the supervisor.)
