He\u2019s got his and doesn\u2019t really want anyone else dipping in the same pool. Give us (we the people) what congress and the senate gets or give them what they want to give us and hear their whining from sea to shining sea. If they really were for the people they\u2019d get with Bernie and we\u2019d have national healthcare like single payer, medicare for all. But they\u2019re not for the people and the people or at least half of\u2019em would still vote republikkkan. They know not what they do and the republiKKKans love it. Keep \u2019em uneducated and dumb and dumber and they keep getting voted back in office like business as usual. Sad!
