It is a good thing but not as great as many imagine it to be. I read because I cannot sleep, or at least sleep very little. So I read a great deal, from the great works of literature and philosophy to detective novels and faerie tales. I read a few books a week depending upon length and complexity. On the upside it means that I am well educated, knowledgeable, able to converse upon almost any topic in easy tones and hold discourse upon almost any subject. I do well in pub quizzes and most people like me. Yet the accumulation of knowledge and thought always comes with a price. I know what Orwell, Sartre, Diogenes, Nietzsche, Hesse and even Goethe (who made it obvious) were thinking. All thought that human life was ultimately pointless. I suspect that they were right. I do have to read, to much time to read. ", "creatorid": "6a9679440a48", "id": "95cb20ff68bd", "child": "", "title": ""}
