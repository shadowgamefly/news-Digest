Those guys seem to help way more than you\u2019d expect.\u2019 As a British person I know what Aussies are like in team sports only too well. I\u2019m not sure Americans have realized yet, which only makes sense given that you lot don\u2019t go up against Aussies in team sport very often. Get an Aussie in your team. Even if they\u2019re not the most talented. They\u2019ll compete like bastards, which\u2019ll shame your more talented players into doing the same.
