There is no incentive for a company to publish articles with topics outside of the realm of what might lead back to a sale. For UXers trying to bolster their personal brand, there is no incentive to write about ideas that wouldn\u2019t sound impressive to a general audience or get them some kind of recognition. In the past two years of reading UX articles pretty intensely, I\u2019ve found that the number of articles that hit my inbox that I end up actually reading to completion has gone from probably 50% to maybe 10%. I\u2019m finding that if I were to stick to a diet of UX articles from all of the sources alluded to in this article, I\u2019d have massive gaps in my understanding of how to design systems using tools from behavioural economics, psychology, and engineering. It\u2019s almost as if any further effort to try to distill important concepts from these disciplines is not likely to lead to more sales or bolster a personal brand, so why study and write about them? The ends are limiting the means. ", "creatorid": "11ad8ea342e", "id": "2c050b157381", "child": "", "title": ""}
