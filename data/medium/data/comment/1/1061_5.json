They\u2019ve gone too far and it\u2019s time for them to be pulled back in,\u201d he added. So let\u2019s see if I got this. You claim that you and you alone are paying your salary because you\u2019ve paid that much in taxes. Excuse me\u200a\u2014\u200aunless you are paying taxes to the tune of $174,000 per year (and that\u2019s just your paycheck\u200a\u2014\u200anot your benefits, your expense account, your staff, etc.) more than you are obligated to, that doesn\u2019t wash. And by your own statement, you admit that you ran for this office to serve your personal interests and no one else\u2019s. You know\u200a\u2014\u200anot even Republicans want to have some self-serving asshole who works only for his own personal selfish interests representing them.
