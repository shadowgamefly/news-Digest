I don't care for Ball\u2019s father, but his actual full quote (which states that James\u2019 sons may have difficulty in their basketball careers due to the pressures brought on by the greatness of his father) are actually fairly astute observations coming from a man who once claimed his son will be better than Curry. James however took it like Ball was actually attacking or threatening his family. Lebron needs to calm down. As for rest, while I am all for players having rights, but the responses by players (including lebron) come off as selfish. The league has to do something about it, as fans of all different socioeconomic status who pay extreme amounts of money to see players like Curry and Lebron suffer. I can understand resting Lebron every now and then, but resting entire starting lineups is going a little too far. And Lebron\u2019s scapegoating of Lue is a bit ridiculous, as everyone knows Lebron can do whatever he wants on that team. ", "username": "charlestyler", "parent": "1930"}
