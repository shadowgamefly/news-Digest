I was once pre-reserved a hotel that also happened to be one where FEMA had booked a large number of people. It was not a 5 star or anything. But it was nice enough to have a breakfast bar with some hot biscuits and the waffle makers\u00a0\u2026. about Hojo level. And these all these kids were very boisterous. I understood that this is the first time they may have seen this much plenty in their lives. \u201cit\u2019s free?\u201d \u201cI can have anything I want?\u201d It was joyful and heartbreaking at the same time.
