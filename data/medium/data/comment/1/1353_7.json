When you know you are 1/1,000+ individual pitches a VC is seeing in a given period, it can be REALLY hard to confidently go in and say we are going small (even if you position it as a \u201cverticalized hack\u201d), building hyper engagement, and we will monetize beyond advertising across 100K users.
