I am 99% anxiety-free now that I\u2019m sober. While I was drinking, I wasn\u2019t convinced that the alcohol alone could cause that much change in me. Escalators, bridges, balconies, airplanes, confined spaces, being the center of attention - all became torture for me. After 30 days sober, I noticed a significant difference. Now 5 years sober and I know that never want to feel that way ever again. ", "creatorid": "e5ba1b3224c0", "id": "b476acdd00b5", "child": "", "title": ""}
