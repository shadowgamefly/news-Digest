The hyperloop is a perfect example of something that will simply not work due the physical constraints of trying to build a vacuum chamber that large. The amount of time it would take just to suck the air out of the chamber would be longer than a flight. The chances of a catastrophic failure at any point in this vacuum would be immensely high and instantly deadly. There\u2019s a dozen other factors to consider all of which become magnitudes more difficult based on the idea of a vacuum tube train. Building a high speed train is a great idea but not on this idea. ", "creatorid": "5aac5900e591", "id": "5636a8d715dc", "child": "", "title": ""}
