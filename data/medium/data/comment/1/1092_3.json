Let\u2019s not talk about cancer, type 1 or 2 diabetes, old people in nursing homes, or all the other conditions that will take a life time of care. Let\u2019s talk about baby\u2019s. Look at the statistics for Medicaid baby\u2019s across the United States. We, as a country, help young people, most are working people, with a way to meet there medical expenses, it\u2019s called Medicaid. Fifty percent of baby\u2019s born across this country have only Medicaid to help them out. In Louisiana it\u2019s seventy six percent! Trump and Ryan\u2019s repeal of the Affordable Care Act is not only an economic disaster for the country, but also a heartless, cruel, and lethal move against young parents, baby\u2019s, and the unborn. They can temper their guilt by giving the states the responsibility of doling out the grants that they provide, but make no mistake, this thoughtless, racist move will hurt mothers, fathers, grandparents, and most of all, baby\u2019s. Take some time, educate yourselves. The ACA is not perfect, but it helps the poor, and has covered more people with good insurance than any time in our history! Let\u2019s make it better, not worse. Cover more, make life better for the yet to be born. ", "creatorid": "8d7e2cff3c36", "timestamp": 1490128643482, "child": "", "username": "888hats"}
