Saturday it was beautiful, but wet conditions meant the Hunter Pace was delayed so I took my horse to a free public park. We jumped around the couple fences then watched a cricket game and checked out a ball field. I was starving so I spent $4 at Taco Bell. That afternoon I had work until midnight but luckily there was lots of free food. Sunday I meant to go to the Hunt Races after graduation, but my friend\u2019s family invited me to lunch so I ended up doing that instead. I figure I can go to the races every year but he\u2019ll only graduate once. So I think I spent all of $4. ", "creatorid": "c204d72e724a", "id": "59852139cc7", "child": "", "title": ""}
