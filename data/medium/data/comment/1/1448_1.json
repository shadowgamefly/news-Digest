If your work is a pile of shit then documenting it isn\u2019t going to make it less of a\u00a0shit. I understand that is an over the top analogy. But I feel everyone is overdocumenting for the sake of attention. I\u2019ve done it in the past. But until your work/vision/idea/product isn\u2019t something of incredible worth. Documenting it, or showcasing your journey around it, isn\u2019t going to do much for your brand. From experience people want to know more about the lives and inner workings of those whose work they admire. Your work is admired by those who then follow your journey. I have experienced it and analysed it first hand as well. That until what you produce work that is \u201cso good that people can\u2019t ignore you\u201d, it is better to shut the hell up and continue improving your work. That doesn\u2019t mean hide behind your screen to wait for perfection to strike before you stammer your way into the public eye. It means improve your work before you improve your marketing.
