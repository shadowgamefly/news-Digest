A question for you, I\u2019ve seen more talk of \u201cT pattern\u201d browsing as we see more and more sites using that type of layout with centre-based content options (not text so much but on landing pages). For example, I\u2019m looking at: https://www.theplayerstribune.com/ and as you scroll down we see more content that is centered on the screen. They still make use of the F pattern to deliver content within an article. I\u2019m curious what you think about an increased use of the T pattern style and if it represents mobile\u2019s influence on design or something else altogether?
