By putting so much thought, analysis and importance into something we perceive as more \u201ccontrollable\u201d we don\u2019t have to think about whatever \u201cuncontrollable\u201d thing we are so scared of. By associating a level of increased importance with the thing we can control, we don\u2019t have to dwell upon whatever it is in our lives that is making us feel vulnerable, unheard, or unimportant. A centipede was happy\u200a\u2014\u200aquite! Until a toad in fun Said, \u201cPray, which leg moves after which?\u201d This raised her doubts to such a pitch, She fell exhausted in the ditch Not knowing how to run.
