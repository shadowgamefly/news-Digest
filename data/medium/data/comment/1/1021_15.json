I feels like from your views that you are not permitted to take designs from conception to completion, and that may be the bigger problem here in our design world. We have become accustom to the idea that theres a UX person and UI person and a researcher etc. I have always pushed to be in meetings that are blue sky and I end my cycle in QA making sure things are pixel perfect, but we adapt to real time issues.
