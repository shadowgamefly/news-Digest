I\u2019m an old \u201cPerl\u201d coder who started making the transition to JS for my web apps a bit over a year ago so I can sure relate to this. I spent a couple months reviewing a ton of frameworks and libraries and plinking around with Node.js looking for what was \u201cbest\u201d then I decided to look for what was \u201ceasy\u201d. I ended up using the Apache web server with CouchDB, PouchDB, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Those tools are easy to learn, have great docs, and provide a huge feature set to get started with. I\u2019ve used almost no server side code building web apps with those tools but I will say knowing Perl is still a big plus. There are still some chores that need to be done on the server side like user account set up and email and Perl makes those easy for me.
