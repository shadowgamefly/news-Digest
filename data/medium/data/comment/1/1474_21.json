For pretty much all of GUI history, users have been conditioned to know how to use and react to error, success, and warning messages displayed as a modal window on top of what they\u2019re doing. Every program we\u2019ve ever used does it, and it\u2019s a useful and well-accepted way to convey those types of messages. If it makes sense to fit the message into the page itself, that\u2019s certainly a good option. But a modal warning message is a great way to get the user to focus on one message exclusively, if that\u2019s the effect that\u2019s desired. They can be used and abused like everything else, but there are plenty of legitimate uses for short messages in modal windows. The rest of the article is good though!
