Just doing some quick calculations (assuming 6.8% and 10 year repayment\u2026so $ 1,841.29 monthly payment). That scholarship is actually worth $220,953.99. So now Nigel get to keep the cash from the monthly payments and puts in a savings account for 10 years at\u00a0.06% he ends up with $ 221,579.54.Over ten years, he has a $442533.53 ( I just added what the total cost of the loan would be plus what the money would be worth if instead it was in a savings account)dollar advantage on a non-scholarship student at the university.(I think this math is right, I did it in like 10 minutes using online calculators.) He,in essence, gets $221,579.54 for playing basketball. This is why I get annoyed with high-scholarship student athletes complaining. Is there problems with the NCAA.
