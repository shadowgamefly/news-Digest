My parents have always had separate bank accounts. They split the bills proportionally based on how much they make. They also each contribute a certain amount of money to a join savings account for house repairs and other unexpected expenses. The one thing they never do though is keep track of how the other spends their expendable income. Whether my mom wants to spend $300 on a new rug or give them to some random homeless person it has nothing to do with my dad and viceversa. My dad wants a new car and he can afford the payments, he can go ahead and buy it without consulting with my mom. Thats one of the most important lessons i ever learned from my parents in terms of maintaining relationships and have implemented it in my personal life as well.
