From what I\u2019ve seen (and done myself) there\u2019s two main things that happen. 1. I make it more complicated then it needs to be (for various reasons, it hasn\u2019t quite clicked how things work, something wasn\u2019t working so you hack away until it does and go down the wrong rabbit hole that you didn\u2019t need to), come back a month later \u201cUrgh what was that I didn\u2019t need to do that.\u201d 2. I didn\u2019t fully understand some of the architectural considerations on how to design the app and components which causes frustration because solving problems in the new world is different to how it\u2019s been solved in the past (so you return to point 1 trying to make something work) Time constraints always have a great affect on how things go. There\u2019s no magical solution, otherwise we\u2019d all be using the same thing and in agreement. ", "creatorid": "53161031c923", "id": "9fc0a8a4d54a", "child": "", "title": ""}
