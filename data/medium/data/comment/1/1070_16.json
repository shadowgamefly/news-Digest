And Neither Think Progress nor The Daily Kos reported the Story of a Pro life Protestor who had her sign ripped down by a College Professor of Woman\u2019s studies who was subsequently disciplined. Think Progress also seems to ignore the plight of the thousands of parents who have had children damaged by vaccines, ignoring the Fact that VAERS reporting system only reports about one to 10% percent of damage from any drugs. This really affects my trust in Natural News as a source of balanced reporting. I have even tried to email individual reporters documentation of the claims I have made related to vaccines on this and other cites. I was never responded to. I want to trust Think Progress and I hope in the future they are more balanced regarding these stories.
