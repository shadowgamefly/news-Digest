Now, when I say \u201ca lot\u201d I mean \u201cenough to get me through the 52\u2013week challenge if I just finish all of these things\u201d. Check it out. Here\u2019s what I currently have sitting in my Medium drafts:            Phew! Sorry guys. Those are the skeletons in my Medium closet. Some of these drafts probably got incorporated into things I actually did publish. Others are things I\u2019ve tried writing about several times but couldn\u2019t really pull together into a cohesive piece. Others are small random things I jotted down but didn\u2019t feel they really comprised enough of a substantial thing to actually publish. All of them require a fair amount of editing before I pull the \u201cpublish\u201d trigger. So, that\u2019s my \u201cthing\u201d for the 52-Week Challenge: Edit, finish, and publish my unfinished drafts. One per\u00a0week. I fear a few of these may not actually be salvageable drafts, so I also commit to publishing the things I suggested may be on the radar in a letter I recently sent to followers of my publication, Navigating the Sea of Singledom:  Basically: stop wavering. Write and publish this stuff, Stella! I have a problem that extends to most parts of my life where I\u2019m good at starting things, but not finishing them. This year, I\u2019ll be working on finishing the things. Wish me luck! ", "username": "writingsolo", "parent": "1869"}
