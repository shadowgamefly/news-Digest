I think it could be done, I\u2019m just wondering if you have any thoughts in that direction. I can see a system where a student received a descriptive account of how they had done (comments) along with the corrected test and the opportunity to make corrections or retest. I could not afford to wait until the end of the term to enter grades (too many of my students are borderline failing and need to know where they stand), but perhaps not entering grades until the revising/feedback process is complete?
