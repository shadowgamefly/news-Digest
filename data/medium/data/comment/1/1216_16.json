You worry, and yet, you know exactly what that hole in your life is. You can be a great father. The lessons young boys learn from their fathers is as much what their father doesn\u2019t do rather than what he does. Boys are filled with aggression and impulsiveness; they lack of discipline and empathy. Fathers show their sons how to limit and harness the first two and build the other two. Fathers show how to choose their battles, and fight with reason and love. This is why young boys without fathers are so feral. They are truly dangerous in so many ways. Yes, they are the stuff of nightmares. And yet, you demonstrate awareness and hope. Keep exploring and helping, and you will be more than just a father for your own children, but a leader for others.
