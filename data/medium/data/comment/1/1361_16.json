You should really do your research and discover that most us \u201cworking poor\u201d are conservatives and the democrats are the ones that you refer to as the \u201closs cause poor\u201d are democrats getting the government handouts (that are being given by liberals dear, not conservatives\u201d\u00a0You should really look in the mirror and figure out why you decided to take up an attack and look down on a group of people with your stereotypes while writing an article about a group of people being looked down upon. So apparently donating a coat (your own possession) doesn\u2019t make you a good person but voting for a crooked politician who wants to give handouts to these \u201clost cause poor\u201d and raise taxes on those that worked hard for a living to get to where they are and take their money to give to others, that must make you a good person apparently. Wow you really have some screwed up views and priorities. ", "creatorid": "ce9c4f868d8f", "id": "ab9191b3c747", "child": "", "title": ""}
