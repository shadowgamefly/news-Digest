I just started working with Swift 4 months ago and have found your tutorials super relevant and easy to follow. While following along I came across an error under Multiple Where Conditions with Self. Xcode doesn\u2019t seem to like \u201cSelf == SomeStruct\u201d and gave the following error. \u201cSame-type requirement makes generic parameter \u2018Self\u2019 non-generic\u201d I\u2019ve read that you can\u2019t constrain generic types so tightly that they would become non-generic (using ==). But that article was written back in 2015. Any help is much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment. Keep up the great work.
