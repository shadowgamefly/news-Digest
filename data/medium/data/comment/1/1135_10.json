I don\u2019t remember if I shared this here yet but I got a large windfall from my stepmother and my late dad last month: $40k to loans, $5k to savings, and $5k to credit card debt (related to cross country travel.) It feels good to be debt free other than the student loans, but my dad was my money advisor\u200a\u2014\u200ahe took a lot of joy in research and running numbers\u200a\u2014\u200aand it would have been nice to share the moment of setting up that big payment with him. I also received my annual bonus last month which allowed me to update a few key wardrobe pieces, pay a big chunk towards my student loans ($2500), and set aside another $5k to savings.
