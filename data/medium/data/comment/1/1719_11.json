I stopped owning a TV 30 years ago (although I did buy one 15 years ago\u2026.then gave it away). Many people can\u2019t believe that I read 50\u201390 books most years. Although I\u2019ve always enjoyed reading the newspaper, I gave that up when I realized that it caused anxiety and fueled anger which I could do nothing about. Alcohol was always a problem and life is so much smoother without it. The last thing I\u2019ve done was giving up 3 of my closest friends who I had known for 18, 28, & 40+ years. I didn\u2019t have the \u201chard conversations\u201d. I just moved 1000 miles away. So it\u2019s taken me much longer to figure some of this out and it\u2019s good to hear you did it quicker. Best in the future! ", "creatorid": "c5b2ef37f3d2", "id": "a276eb71b33a", "child": "", "title": ""}
