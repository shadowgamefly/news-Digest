Interesting how the article photo is him shooting a free throw\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was abysmal all year (under 50%) but then went 10 for 14 in the BIG10 tourney I believe. If he keeps knocking those down we may make a run. Also crazy how this is an article about his versatility yet he\u2019s never even shot a 3 yet and only shot 5 times all year from outside the paint. If he adds one or both of those next year we\u2019re looking at Kaminsky 2.0 ", "username": "Showstoppa", "parent": "1997"}
