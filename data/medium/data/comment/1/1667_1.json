Every good team have a shot, and everyone is one loss away to being left out (or in the case of TCU, one win away). The sample is small (only two previous final rankings) but they are consistent: all four top teams were an undefeated or one-loss Power-5 Conference champion. That should be the requisite to be in. If you have a two-loss champion, it goes in the bubble and remains outside if there is a one-loss non-champion or a undefeated non-Power 5 Conference champion. Imagine this scenario: Alabama wins out (its in), Clemson wins out (its in), Washington wins out (its in), Ohio St. beats Michigan and Penn St. wins the B1G title (PSU and OSU go the bubble), Western Michigan wins out (its in). #1 Alabama, #2 Clemson, #3 Washington, #4 Western Michigan. It sound proposterous to put the MAC champion over PSU and OSU but, the Buckeyes can\u2019t pass over the Nittany Lions because the lost to them, and Penn St. has two losses so it can\u2019t pass over the undefeated Broncos. Crazy scenario, yeah, but you have to give this mid-majors the chance to prove themselves against the powerhouses. (Remember the 2007 Fiesta Bowl).
