I think you have some valid points but at the end of the day the beauty of the internet is free access to information\u200a\u2014\u200ashouldn\u2019t we just let people judge for themselves what\u2019s best? I do love that the UX community is all about sharing and I wouldn\u2019t like to change. I agree, sometimes it\u2019s harder to get to the \u201cgood stuff\u201d but as it is with anything that becomes popular. Personally I have no problem if people are trying to \u201csell\u201d something, if the content they provide is good. Look at invasion\u2019s articles\u200a\u2014\u200asome of them are quite good! And they are definitely trying to push their products. I think it\u2019s more about people sharing \u201cmagic formulas\u201d rather then talking about they tackled a problem, their process, outcomes, etc. ", "creatorid": "c3544f139c15", "id": "43777bc313cb", "child": "", "title": ""}
