Copyright law will inadvertently make much of the literature, music, and art of our time disappear. There are already songs from my teen years that I want to hear again but can\u2019t find; the CDs are long sold out, the illegal copies removed from the internet with DMCA takedown notices, the IP holders refusing to re-release them in any form. In some cases the singer or instrumentalist has died, so a re-recording or performance isn\u2019t even possible. ", "creatorid": "956390f3fac4", "id": "65fe8018e0e2", "child": "", "title": ""}
