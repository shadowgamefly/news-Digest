I definitely understand the importance of white space in showing clarity, no matter what form of design we\u2019re doing. I just hope that clients will soon be able to understand this importance of white space, rather than try to clutter all their demands into one page. I used to work for an advertising firm who was designing the UI for a travel website. They made sure to include the basic white space, but the client ended up requesting a whole bunch of shit to be added\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0went\u00a0along\u00a0with\u00a0it, making the web page harder to read. I just feel it\u2019s our duty as designers to remind and educate clients of basic design principles. ", "creatorid": "af9da6bd1b39", "timestamp": 1491542435736, "child": "", "username": "jfs.urbano"}
