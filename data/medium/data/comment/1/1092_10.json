One is the stock market. The other is the possibility of a plague that doesn\u2019t have an easy cure. Instead of being the heartbeat of the economy, as it is seen by some, the stock market has become a parasitic economy on the outside of the real economy. It sucks money out of real businesses by being a place to deposit money that could be invested in improvements, but isn\u2019t. It has climbed past a place where there is an actual value behind it. It is now mostly money made on manipulating other money. That means that a whole lot of its value could evaporate (again). Because the money that is behind it on paper, and since the banks have consolidated even more, we could be on the hook for a bailout again. That\u2019s where a lot of healthcare profits go.Look here: http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/healthcare/ The second thing I mentioned is a new plague. The difference between the outbreak of ebola in Guinea and the on in the U.S. (that didn\u2019t happen) is that the U.S. stepped in quickly. If something with a slow incubation period were to break out again, all of those uninsured people who were carriers would be spreading it through every school, restaurant and store. People who didn\u2019t feel well would still go to work like they always do. Weeks later, the full size of the outbreak would become clear.
