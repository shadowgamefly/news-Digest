If the pre-ACA healthcare system didn\u2019t convince people, then trying again now probably wouldn\u2019t either. Again, not an expert on how things were pre-ACA, so maybe there were too many regulations for it to be considered a principled conservative system, but I\u2019m skeptical that the way forward is with another step back. In my mind, the argument we need to make to principled conservatives is that single-payer is actually an argument for smaller government. The US spends more public funds on healthcare than most single payer systems and achieves vastly worse outcomes and lower coverage. I think there\u2019s a midpoint between moderate socialism and moderate libertaranism that could understand that single payer would actually mean less government and greater equality.
