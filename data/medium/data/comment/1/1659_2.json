Despite Alabama\u2019s ability to put up points, they weren't able to sustain enough offense throughout the game to give their defense a rest or tire Clemson. Even their scoring drives were brief, with 3 of the 4 TD drives lasting a minute or less. The play total by drive for the second half was horrid. (4,3,3,4,4,3,3,6) Its a minor miracle that Alabama only lost the time of possession battle by 9 minutes. (And that is flattered by getting two quick turnovers in the game) Hurts was awful in this game. 13\u201331 for 131 yards is very Osweiller of him. If not for that big run late in the 4th, he\u2019d be shouldering the loss in its entirety. ", "creatorid": "f3a3334ab643", "id": "a1bf8e16de8b", "child": "", "title": ""}
