It\u2019s just an integral part of the design process, no less or more important than other activities. I recently had a conversation with the director of a digital agency. He suggested that the growth of UX as a discrete role probably stems from agencies\u2019 desire to justify fees to clients. He did go on to say that the trend has probably had a positive effect beyond the bottom line. The UX process can be a great way to engage with stakeholders and get them on board with design decisions. In my experience, wearing the UX hat provides an opportunity to step back, be objective about a project and remind yourself to empathise with the audience.
