That one decision played a big part in the makeup of the typewriter. Wow, I had no idea that was purely for marketing. It\u2019s crazy to think that such an old standard has stuck around for over a century when technology moves so fast and standards are always changing. Being a touch typist I\u2019m very disappointed with the QWERTY layout\u2019s left hand bias like you pointed out and after doing some research, I\u2019m planning to make the switch to Colemak this summer.
