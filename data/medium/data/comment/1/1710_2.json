Her no nonsense advice echoes many of the truths about fitness that I\u2019ve managed to find. As someone who toiled away on road bikes and plodded for hours in running shoes, the only thing that\u2019s made real changes in my body is grabbing some weights and going to town. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen people train for ultra endurance events and not really get the kind of fitness they want. Erin Stern is the person who really got me started on weights. Stick to the six basic lifts (which are, as she puts it: squat, bench, row, deadlift, overhead press, pull up). I think it\u2019s also important to change it up, much like the author of this post says. Besides lifting weights, I train in Aikido and Capoeira, mountain bike and do yoga. I also rock climb (which is the ultimate in strength and cardio). If I could only do one of these activities, it would probably be rock climbing. The author of Put the Pink Dumbbell down pretty much nails it on the head. Read it, and live it. ", "creatorid": "3611a228d1ca", "id": "4f87c3b4efb5", "child": "", "title": ""}
