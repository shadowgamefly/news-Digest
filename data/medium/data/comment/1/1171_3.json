I\u2019ve tried BuJo, I\u2019ve tried several formal planner systems. My ADD/ADHD brain works best on its own, with some loose goals and organization, with complete freedom because life is messy and resistant to limitations. I like the idea of index cards, with colored tabs, in labeled file boxes. Reality of my limited physical space means if I get that far, I\u2019ll keep important notes, ideas, recipes, etc. in organized computer files (text for some, images for others) saved in my phone and synced in the appropriate app or sharing software between my phone and laptop. I\u2019m an analog girl in a tech (limited living space) kind of world.  ", "creatorid": "c50da0386699", "timestamp": 1491289322547, "child": "", "username": "krisyarwood"}
