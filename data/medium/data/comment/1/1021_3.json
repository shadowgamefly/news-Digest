For instance when we design digital products such as websites and apps, we define and use UX as the method through which we design for the holistic product. UX as it\u2019s used in digital product design is, to your point, a part of product design and not an adjacent discipline. That said, \u2018user experience\u2019, \u2018customer experience\u2019 or whatever you want to label it as, can and should be defined as the experience a user has with a product or service, of which product design is a piece. As far as differentiation goes, there are two main business cases for and against \u2018pushing the envelope\u2019. The first is branding where differentiation (and \u2018painting pretty pictures\u2019) is massively helpful. I don\u2019t really understand why designers try so hard to distance themselves from the visual aesthetic aspect of design\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s super important and a part of product design in which designers are uniquely positioned to create value. On the other hand, homogeny among product design is pretty helpful in leveraging learned behavioral patterns. For screen-based products it\u2019s really a matter of finding a balance between the two. I\u2019m inclined to believe that \u2018UX\u2019 the way we use it today has a shelf-life, and that it will become expected that people apply \u2018UX\u2019 to whatever position they hold or part of a product they are contributing to whether it\u2019s design, development, growth, revenue or anything else.
