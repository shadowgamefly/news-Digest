A company\u2019s stated values are often not the actual values of the company\u200a\u2014\u200awhen unearthing the company\u2019s values, I advise clients to think about 1) what would get someone promoted, 2) what would keep you from hiring someone, and 3) what would get someone fired, because under those are the company\u2019s actual values. The challenge is often #2 when it comes to unconscious bias, as you mention in this story. There are the \u201cabove board\u201d reasons we won\u2019t hire someone, but we also know that people have a tendency to hire based upon their comfort with someone rather than whether they\u2019re the best candidate for the company\u2019s goals. This has the tendency to exclude minorities, LBGTQ folks, people who don\u2019t speak fluent Mid-Western English (in the US), people with disabilities, older candidates, parents, and well, a lot of people. We can backwards-infer what would keep people from hiring someone based upon who they have been and are hiring\u200a\u2014\u200acompanies often don\u2019t like that inference, though. When your gauge of cultural fit is whether someone gets excited about your ping-pong table and on-tap beer, it\u2019s time to get real about your values. Alas, candidates that ask how conflict gets resolved or what time most people leave the office are more often dismissed as poor cultural fits because they\u2019re not just buying into the company\u2019s ethos/mission/awesomeness, when they\u2019re asking questions that may very well lead to positive value/cultural change.
