For the record, I\u2019m a fiscal conservative and a social \u201cdon\u2019t-be-a-dick-ican,\u201d so this isn\u2019t even entirely my fight. But by casting such a wide net and blaming shitty behavior on anyone who prefers smaller government\u200a\u2014\u200aas if there are no compassionate conservatives\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re helping to widen the political chasm in this country. Instead of telling the story of a hard working woman who struggles, as many Americans do; instead of helping to find unity in this country, you\u2019ve contributed 6 more minutes toward creating resentment and hate. Congratulations. You\u2019re part of the problem. ", "creatorid": "e5a9aeca47f5", "id": "cabcc632a99e", "child": "", "title": ""}
