This is one of the finest pieces I have read on the sharing economy. You are a beyond-amazing writer. Thank you for your remarkable insights. Platform cooperativism sounds a bit like the high-tech version of the cooperative business model. The next era for Uber will be driverless. Uber drivers need to realize they cannot gain financial independence this way as they are simply fattening Uber\u2019s pockets so they themselves can be eliminated. I hope the day comes soon when these freelancers and micro-entrepreneurs jump ship and share in the wealth of a transparent, rules based, and auditable digital platform which renders the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world superfluous.

Blockchain technology, distributed computing, and smart contracts may well be the answer. This is an exciting time indeed!
