I spend so much time being distracted/productive/entertained at the computer that I\u2019ve decided that when it\u2019s time for a new phone, I\u2019ll ditch the smart one and go for a single purpose flip-phone. That way, when I\u2019m sitting down to work and interact at the computer, it\u2019s with mindfulness and purpose. No more pulling out the phone to answer a text and then scrolling through Facebook for hours. ", "creatorid": "de22cdba3379", "id": "c3f55755d8d", "child": "", "title": ""}
