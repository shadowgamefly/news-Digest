Turns out he deleted his account in protest that Medium didnt ban a particular user that turned out to be a self proclaimed pedophile against molestation. He was trying to normalize pedophillic desire as a harmless thing and Thin Man took extreme exception to Medium allowing platform for this. Also he said some rather unfiltered things about one user he accused of breaking employment law. This user threatened to sue for Libel and shortly after his account disappeared, I cant discount that he may be in legal trouble at this point. In hindsight I felt a little humbled and ashamed that I just assumed his personal disappearance from myself had something to do with a heated debate we got in just the day before.
