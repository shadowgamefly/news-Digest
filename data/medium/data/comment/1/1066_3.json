Many other Nations considered to be very Liberal have never accepted the number of immigrants as America has. Consider Australia that tells all prospective immigrants that they must show how they are needed or an added value to Australia before they can be approved. The only things Americans in general oppose is \u201cillegal immigration\u201d and we have a concern for an extremely narrow and small segment of immigrants that come from Nations that either do not, or cannot, participate in adequate background checks and vetting of their citizens and they also have massive numbers of radicals in their society.
