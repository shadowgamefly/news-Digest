You get outgained, lose the turnover battle, and only move the ball a total of 5 yards in the 4th quarter, you\u2019re likely going to lose. Michigan had every chance to win this game and if they stop OSUs 4th and 1 that led to the tying FG, they don\u2019t have to deal with OT. They let a good team hang around for too long and put a game that they had multiple chances to put away in the hands of officials. When it came down to it, OSU still needed 15 more yards after the conversion from Barrett and Samuel got them the 15 yards without anyone from Michigan laying a finger on him.
