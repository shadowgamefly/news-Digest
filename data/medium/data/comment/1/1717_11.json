What\u2019s interesting is the resistance you pointed out from friends and doctors. Even when I\u2019ve casually pointed out that \u201cI\u2019m a little heavier than I used to be.\u201d or the other day \u201cthis type of excercise is making my core thicker\u201d, a completely neutral statement of fact, my friends respond in this frightened reflexive \u201cNO! You\u2019re sooo thin!\u201d. Did I just say I was a bad person? Appearantly having a thick middle is an awful thing you should never say about yourself. For the record, I\u2019m not soooooo thin. I\u2019m at the top range of a normal bmi. I do not WANT to be soooooo thin. I want to be able to describe my body without being corrected by randos.
