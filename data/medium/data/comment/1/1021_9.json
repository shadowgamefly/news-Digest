And user experience does not dictate the design, it informs it. Along with brand traits, business goals, etc. UX is a higher level than the visual design. You don\u2019t design a brochure if you don\u2019t know the purpose\u2014and that purpose typically came from business. But finally more and more understand it should also come from users. Just like you shouldn\u2019t visually design a website if you don\u2019t know what the users expect from that website. I am a visual designer, with a whole 60-man UX team behind me. From researchers, to writers, IAs, interaction designers, and coders. I don\u2019t feel like I am limited by their insights and input. I still design cool stuff that meets the needs and requirements. I\u2019m not sure how having all that insight limits design? If anything, all that research should give you more ammunition to develop and validate your design decisions. More ammo to explain how you do more than just make stuff pretty. More leniency to design crazy ideas because you have user testing to validate. Research and wireframes may take away from the time you could have been designing that amazing website. But it\u2019s better than all the time wasted designing that amazing website to find out it fails, and you have to start over.
