For the Scan it option i feel the design can be further simplified by removing the capture screen in between.  Also why will we really need a view history tag on the scan screen.  That can be accessed from past orders as well if someone wants to re-order/ view related products to something already ordered in past. May be i am missing something here. Looking forward to hear more about it from you. ", "creatorid": "4ca8aee9a8c2", "id": "530ae9f39791", "child": "", "title": ""}
