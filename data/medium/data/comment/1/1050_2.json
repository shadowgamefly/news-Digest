Everyone seems to be obsessed with creating new JS tools and frameworks and libraries. However, these don\u2019t help us solve Business or Domain problems, they only create new ones for US to solve. What was wrong with Backbone? Nothing, but now you\u2019ll get laughed out of the conference room if you suggest going with that. Want to go with Angular? Great! Which one? Because 2 means that you need to know Typescript. What\u2019s Typescript you ask? Well some people thought that JavaScript being dynamically typed wasn\u2019t good enough so they needed it to be statically typed (sort of). I get that in every profession you always need to keep up with new technologies and you have to keep learning, but in the JS community it\u2019s not the right kind of learning and keeping up. If you compare it to being a Doctor, it wouldn\u2019t be like they\u2019re learning new ways to treat cancer it would be like they are having to learn how to use a new kind of scalpel and if they prefer the old one then they are a quack. Furthermore, our over-reliance on gigantic toolchains only hurt us in the long run. Our goal as Programmers are to manage and minimize dependencies, not create unnecessary ones. This isn\u2019t specific to the JS community either, I\u2019ve seen Gemfiles that require multiple mouse wheel scrolls to get through. What we get are applications that we don\u2019t really understand and can\u2019t reason about. I\u2019m not bashing the author of this article and I applaud her efforts in learning JS. My point is that as a Developer community, we shouldn\u2019t be just accepting that we have to learn all of these new tools just because they are the \u201chip\u201d thing to learn. The work of Developers are always in service to other communities and to society in general. Our work shouldn\u2019t be just creating new frameworks for the sake of creating them.
