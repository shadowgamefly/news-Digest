When talking about strength of schedule, wins over Northwestern, Washington State, Illinois, and Oregon State are not thrown out for schools in those conferences, who regularly get rewarded for beating up on group of five, or even FCS schools. Further, teams like Michigan and Ohio State need to destroy inferior in conference opponents by 70 to prove their worth. If a team has been convincing in beating every team in front of them, including when bigger schools are paying them to play, why not reward them with a shot? I am sure conference commissioners would get upset, but how about this: penalize power 5 schools for even playing non-conference games against teams outside of the power 5. That way it makes more sense to just say \u201cThese are the 5 conferences we\u2019re pulling from. The NBA does not play regular season games against the D-League, so our best teams will not be playing judged while playing against inferior opponents.\u201d It will also end up making more money for the schools and conferences. The early season showcases at AT&T stadium will increase as major programs must match up in order to bolster their resume.
