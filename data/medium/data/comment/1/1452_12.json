I don\u2019t think things are so binary, though, to the point you either completely ignore SEO, or you let that drive your entire editorial calendar; to the point you either use a fear-inducing headline (\u201c10 design mistakes you\u2019re making\u201d) or you use a boring one. There\u2019s a balance to everything. But again: pretty subjective. Just the fact people stopped to think about that once they read my article makes me happy.
