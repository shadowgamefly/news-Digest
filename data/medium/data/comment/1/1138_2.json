Initially we had a joint account. This caused confusion, bounced checks, and frustration. We had to separate. Now we both contribute to the household bills. Any money left over is ours to do with as we please. This has worked very well for us. If I decide to buy a new computer, or if she decides to buy something she wants, there is never a question of \u201ccan we afford it\u201d. Each of us decides ourself, with our own money, whether we can afford it. I remember at one point when my wife was not working (stay at home Mom for a 4 or 5 years). It really bothered her to have to ask me for money. So for that time period, I would get my pay check, take out enough spending money for myself, and transfer the rest to her. She paid all the bills out of it and used the remainder (which was pretty much the same as my spending money\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes more, sometimes less) as she saw fit. Again this worked well for both of us. We also own 2 houses. One is in her name only and the other is in my name only. Each of us is the beneficiary to the other (with the houses, life insurance etc) of course. I have recommended this method to many people (including our children). In marriage, or co-habitations, finances are one of the primary causes of arguments. This takes away all of that. Lastly, in this day and age where this is E-Transfers, and online banking, I see no need for anyone ever to have a joint account with anyone. It is so easy to exchange money back and forth.
