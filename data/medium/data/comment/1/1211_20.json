It always brings such joy when a friend has found a book that has moved them so much that they, by turn, become more avid readers and you can see how their reading starts affecting their view of the world. So much time is spent growing up being forced to read for school and I feel like that tends to negatively color people\u2019s opinions of it. Though for those who claim they don\u2019t have the time, I think it does come down to the thought that it is some luxury that requires you to sit for hours to read a book, and while it does take that time to finish reading a book, it need not all be at once. I too am an advocate for the bathroom reading, the waiting in line reading, the bring a book with you everywhere because even Kindle on your phone can be helpful, and read in whatever spare moments you have reading. Reading is such a pleasurable experience and one that should be enjoyed by more people! ", "creatorid": "e44e2e438d1e", "id": "4ea83ff70a96", "child": "", "title": ""}
