It is very interesting to see what\u2019s possible on such big established apps like instagram. For me as a beginner it serves great inspiration! And all the people crying that it\u2019s not fair and you shouldn\u2019t do this. These are just the people that lack the knowledge to build something similar themselves and giving too much value to such platforms anyways. I think it\u2019s a great initiative of yours and will definitely help the developer team at instagram. Keep on writing and have a nice day!
