If there\u2019s even a doubt then don\u2019t. There are so many factors into a QB\u2019s success. Why was David Carr unsuccessful and Dak Prescott successful? I\u2019ve been a Dak fan (my dad is a MSSTate ticket holder) but the big difference is that Carr didn\u2019t have protection. He got hit more than any other QB during his time as a starter and he became scared. Competent to Good to Great QB\u2019s come from every round. There\u2019s no evidence that suggest that first rounders have better careers. Unless you have what feels like a sure thing like an Andrew Luck then I think the best move is to build a team elsewhere. ", "username": "jovanllrobinson", "parent": "1927"}
