You are nailing it as far as I can tell. I love it when multiple sources say the same thing and you are saying all the stuff we have learned. My wife and I have always thought surgery can be useful to remove a tumor, but I\u2019m leery of anything beyond that. I\u2019d really have to be sold on the procedure. But as for treatment centers, I would totally consider Gerson in Mexico as well as Oasis of Hope and Hope 4 Cancer in Tijuana. And then Utopia Wellness in Florida is on an Indian Reservation so the FDA can\u2019t touch \u2019em. So it\u2019s just a matter of where you feel comfortable. I love Gerson because they are so plugged in to nutrition. But no, I\u2019m not a big fan of surgery as far as cancer is concerned because unless it\u2019s restricting a particular part of the body, then it can be killed 30 different ways (with no chemo, radiation or drugs.) So great to hear your story! (Keep me posted, you can friend me on Facebook) ", "username": "jeffwitzeman", "parent": "1885"}
