That\u2019s how I tend to do purchases. I rarely will buy something on credit. Instead I save until I can afford it. That\u2019s also coming from someone who six years ago had a living room that was couchless for a few months- I had a dinner date first date and we sat on the floor at my coffee table because I also didn\u2019t have a dining room table. Anyway, just pointing out that there\u2019s the option to 1. take the loan, 2. don\u2019t get a couch or 3. wait a bit and buy the couch with your own money, when you can.
