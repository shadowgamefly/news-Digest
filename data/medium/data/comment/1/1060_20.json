Let\u2019s look at this a different way. If you owned the airline and you overbooked, what would you do? You can\u2019t say you wouldn\u2019t overbook or you wouldn\u2019t be in business. Now, they can limit how often it happens, but let\u2019s just assume it happens to you because it will sooner or later. Now what? You have to get some passengers to get off the plane and give up their seats but nobody wants to do that? What do you do? Apparently, most of you would simply allow the passengers who make the most noise to stay on the plane? You\u2019re going to let whoever throws a temper tantrum to stay on the plane? No, you\u2019re all wrong. Regardless of how loud and crazy this guy was, they did the right thing. HE CAUSED the injury to himself by not being cooperative. They had no choice.
