The cussing one. Our societies are so plagued with cussing words. I agree with you completely. I don\u2019t judge people who cuss, far from that. I just want to say that I am sustaining myself from cussing, too and trying to make my verbal environment clean. The verbal ecology. I know we are emotional beings. And sometimes the (visceral) emotions call for 4-letter words, I understand that. But that is the easy way. It takes an effort not to say them. Yes, it can be understood as a character building habit. And since you mentioned the Old Testament, let me remind you of what Jesus said to Saint Peter. \u201cGet thee behind me, Satan\u201d. I think it is far worse than a four letter word we use, or don\u2019t anymore. And Jesus was so angry once that he demolished the tables of moneychangers before a temple. I say to myself. You can get pissed and throw an F-word or two, just to get people\u2019s attention. Just do not overdo it because it makes you superficial. Visceral emotions are strong but superficial, and they reflect our language and vice versa. God Bless. ", "username": "tomo.kristof", "parent": "1882"}
