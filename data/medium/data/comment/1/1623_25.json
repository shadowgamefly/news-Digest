Fell asleep at his house, so Saturday morning there was a very necessary egg mcmuffin stop ($5.31), and then I spent the day cleaning, grocery shopping ($48.47) and doing laundry. Saturday night, I went on a last minute tinder date\u200a\u2014\u200ahe picked up the tab, and I dropped $10 (ugh) for parking. Yesterday was another lazy day\u2026I ended up with a pretty bad headache and took a nap, laid outside and read in the sun, and then my roommate and I went out for wings and hockey ($18). I did not go shopping, get my nails done, or get my car washed, but still managed to spend $118.79. ", "creatorid": "939260cd766e", "id": "f7363a8b50a3", "child": "", "title": ""}
