The two dropdown (filter and sorting) on the feedback page, by default, you make them display the label name as oppose to the default filtering/sorting. Filtering is OK because usually by default no filter is applied, but I\u2019d think users would be wondering about the current sorting. Maybe it is a necessary trade-off, but maybe there is other ways. What was you thoughts on this? The filter dropdown contains two checkboxes for book format and verified purchase, there is no way to display that selection once the dropdown list is collapsed. Maybe just removed these two filter options? One last thing, when I have both dropdown fillterd, for instance, Negative Reviews on left, and Top Reviews on right, I got a little confused on which dropdown is filtering and which is sorting. Thoughts? Thanks again for sharing this great case study. Good work! ", "creatorid": "bc9938d5fb13", "id": "855399a78cd6", "child": "", "title": ""}
