I am fascinated by what brains do. As a person who is fully functionally ambidextrous (can write with both hands at once,mirror image, upsidedown even) I have spent a lifetime intimately involved with making what seem like idiot decisions to other people because L and R have almost no functional meaning to me. In addition to enjoying that little glitch in the system I also went through the whole barfing up of years of repressed memories in one very unpleasant gush. Such a bizarre experience! I work with people now as a kind of mentor for personal healing and while I myself have rarely experienced Deja Vu, I have people ask me about it all the time! I will now happily keep a link to your piece on hand!Thank you so much! ", "creatorid": "3f11b2d6dbdf", "id": "e933070188fb", "child": "", "title": ""}
