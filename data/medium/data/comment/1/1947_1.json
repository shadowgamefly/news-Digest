Even the sternest critics of this movie\u200a\u2014\u200athose who felt that Shyamalan betrayed the gritty-realism bro-code\u200a\u2014\u200astill admitted that the movie was more than the sum of its parts. I take that as an admission that it had some great parts! That means Paul Giamatti\u2019s performance, James Newton Howard\u2019s career best score, and the loping cinematography of Christopher Doyle who turned an economically depressed, multi-ethnic, kitsch apartment block into a dank Arkham/Atlantis. My favourite shot is the large one above of Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) when she is on the floor of the bathroom answering forbidden questions by making signs (!) to Anna(Sarita Choudhury). The camera shows parts of her (parts of the Story, geddit, *wheeze*) which just made Howard\u2019s already intriguing face look completely inscrutable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a perfect shot, but it got seared onto the back of my eyeballs for all time. I am now a lifelong Bryce Dallas Howard fan and learning to live with this condition. I say this to engage with, rather than criticise Art of the Film\u2019s \u201cCinema in the New Millennium\u201d which is a majestic work and pretty much flawless. (And how great that they included Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, a dark masterpiece!) Thanks for this! xc ", "username": "chrismayhap", "parent": "1947"}
