It is a result of years and years of being told, \u201cReach for the stars,\u201d \u201cYou are unique and can do anything you want,\u201d \u201cpursue your bliss.\u201d All these messages are fine and good, once the bills are paid for. However, our young people have not been taught to pay the bills, and then pursue their bliss. Instead, they have been encouraged to go to fashion school, art school, and take ________ studies courses. (Ethnic studies, Women\u2019s studies\u2026 fill in the blank with whatever courses lead to absolutely no career.) But these schools are expensive. And, as colleges fight for the teachers with the most cache, costs go up. So those kids who were taught to follow their dreams before they were taught to pay for them have crap loads of student debt. I was one of those kids. I went to a private school and took classes in philosophy, drama, and English\u200a\u2014\u200anot really marketable skills. So I learned, when the debt faced me, that I needed to learn a marketable skill before to pay off my debt. It was a hard lesson, but sometimes life sucks like that. If you want something, you need to pay for it. It seems simple to me, but liberals tend to make it ridiculously complicated. Get a job. Save some money. Pay your bills. And, if you work hard and are lucky, you get to pursue your dreams. Don\u2019t expect me to pay for your dreams. Don\u2019t blame it on the loan company when they expect you to pay for your dreams. We\u2019d do better to take a look at how we manage expectations in the lower grades in order to create workers who are needed, rather than subsidizing kids who think they want to be the next computer animation guru, or next super designer/ ", "creatorid": "1987ec1ae836", "id": "4a3c0446bc5d", "child": "", "title": ""}
