A history lesson about \u201cAnti-Fa?\u201d How about a history lesson on the First Amendment? The true Fascists were the members of that group who shut down a speech and engaged in violence to do so. Of all places, universities should be forums where all views can be expressed, especially controversial ones. Legitimizing groups like this and empowering them to define what speech is \u201cFascist\u201d and what isn\u2019t is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. If people didn\u2019t like what the speaker represented or had to say, that\u2019s fine.
