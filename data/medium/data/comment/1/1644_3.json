The configuration of the stadium itself is asymmetrical. All of the suites are located on the west side of the stadium, in order to bring seats on the east side as close to the field as possible. This is not unique among NFL stadiums: Ford Field and Soldier Field are similarly configured. The difference at Levi\u2019s is that the seated side is the one facing the afternoon sun, and the west side of the stadium is noticeably shorter, meaning the sun isn\u2019t blocked by the opposite grandstand until much later than what is usual. Fenway Park\u2019s left-field bleachers were once notorious for facing the sun; other ballparks\u2019 bleachers had similar orientations, but Fenway\u2019s main grandstand lacked an upper deck for most of its history.Also, Santa Clara is on the west coast, meaning every 49ers home game (except for night games) starts at 1:00 local time. In the rest of the country, teams can count on some late-afternoon games that start with the sun setting below stadium level, and end under the lights. The 49ers can\u2019t host those games. The Raiders have closed off Mt. Davis in recent years for these reasons, moreso than attendance. Of course, the Coliseum is long overdue for replacement.
