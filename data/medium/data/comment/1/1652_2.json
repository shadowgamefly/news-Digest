They were reading their press clippings a little too much before the game, started thinking they were hot shit, and got punched in the mouth. You learn a lesson from these games. Keep in mind this is just one game. Florida (the reigning east champs) had to go to OT last year to beat Florida Atlantic. Georgia barely beat Georgia Southern and an ass Georgia Tech squad. Hiccups happen, although I wish it wasn\u2019t during the opener. In closing, feel free to call the Vols overrated all you want. I\u2019d rather everyone overlook us than think we\u2019re hot shit anyways. ", "creatorid": "fb5d970dd1fe", "id": "28844d97e7e7", "child": "", "title": ""}
