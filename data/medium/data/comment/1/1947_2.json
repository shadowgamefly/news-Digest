Brad Pitt running on a treadmill in a well lit gym in \u2018Burn After Reading'? Seriously? It\u2019s a static shot, the camera does nothing. The lighting is realistic and unremarkable. So why does it get included? Because Brad Pitt waves his arms around in a funny manner, that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s not cinematography. And, even though I hate the film itself, \u2018The Revenant\u2019 deserves some recognition, as the cinematography was the one good thing it had going for it. Glad to see \u2018Sunshine\u2019 get a little love. K\u00fcchler is underrated, and should have had a scene or two from \u2018Hanna\u2019 and \u2018Steve Jobs\u2019 in the mix as well. All in all, cinematography is one of those nebulous ideas that far too few people understand. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re starting to get some real attention of late.
