It's called Kaospilot (http://www.kaospilot.dk) and they teach in English. They offer the education we all need to succeed in life and which I wish I could have had 25, 20 or even 15 years ago. BTW, I don't work for them and I receive no compensation for recommending them either. Hope this helps. Good luck!
