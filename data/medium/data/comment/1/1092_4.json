An they will not have the discretionary cash to invest in HSAs. The huge cuts to Medicaid will leave millions without health care. There is no way that the states will be able to cover the need of the poor and chronically ill. These individuals will lose their health care and not be able to afford private health care. The AHCA only benefits the millionaires and billionaires in this country. There is absolutely noway that the lower to middle income individuals in this nation will be able to afford the policies under the AHCA. As based on the policies offered before the ACA was passed in 2010. So, let us not rush into totally shifting health care delivery in this country again. The AHCA bill is out now. Give the insurance industry time to come up with sample policies under the new bill. A test drive so to speak to see if the American public will be able to afford health care under this law. Also would give state governments time to see how they would be able to care for their most vulnerable citizens. Let us not rush in to massive change to our health care delivery before we know the effects it will have on the country and it\u2019s citizens!
