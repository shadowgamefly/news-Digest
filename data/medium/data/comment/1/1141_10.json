I am sorry for your loss. As you already seem to be, in future consider engaging a highly skilled tax practitioner (expert) and use your new found \u201cfree time\u201d to dive deeper into your own subject matter specialty\u200a\u2014\u200adriving heretofore unattainable accretive value\u00a0for\u00a0you\u00a0own\u00a0account. According to sound economic theory this approach will be more beneficial to all interested parties. Thanks for the post.\u00a0Cheers!
