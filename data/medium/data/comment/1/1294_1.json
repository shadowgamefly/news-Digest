It hasn\u2019t aged that well but it was so ahead of it\u2019s time in 1994. I bought the game on GOG but I had a hard time getting into it, I might try sticking at it again after reading your article. I\u2019m looking forward to the System Shock Remaster, System Shock deserves one. Looking forward to your other articles, fantastic job on this one and the recommended reading/viewing should keep me busy for awhile.
