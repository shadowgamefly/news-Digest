I learned Python with it and the idea of InstaPy came from the chapter about Selenium\u00a0;) Depending on what you want to do exactly, you could also go on github and get some of the jupyter notebooks with coding challenges: https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks Hope that helped.Good luck and happy coding. A friend and I also work with kids in a library and teach them some basic coding concepts.We use Scratch, which is probably better for younger childs: https://scratch.mit.edu ", "creatorid": "fc204c62b387", "id": "9ace34412230", "child": "", "title": ""}
