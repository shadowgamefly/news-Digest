Let me preface this by saying these sorts of things give me hives, which is why I like reading the Billfold b/c it\u2019s not intimidating. Armed with Google knowledge I opened a TD Ameritrade account and dumped money into it, thinking I could select 2 Vanguard index funds (why I didn\u2019t go directly to Vanguard itself is beyond you and me). Lo and behold I can\u2019t purchase those index funds via TD for god knows why. So now my money is just languishing there while I avoid doing anything with it. This is why I\u2019m like Liz Lemon and all my money is in a checking account. ", "creatorid": "e57e8947d1e4", "timestamp": 1492196391700, "child": "", "username": "coffeeplz"}
