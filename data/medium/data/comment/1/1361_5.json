Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Entitled, and their children, will not \u201cget it.\u201d But I certainly do. I\u2019m seventy-years-old, living on a fixed income, and spend half of every month pretending I\u2019m not hungry. \u201cI\u2019m on a diet,\u201d is a great excuse for not ordering anything but water when family or friends want to meet at a local restaurant for dinner. I\u2019ve done the math. I am living below the poverty line. I no longer see doctors or dentists; because, even with health insurance, the co-pays are more than I can afford. Pride gets in the way of my asking for help. Especially from my children, though they all have post-graduate educations, which I paid for, and earn incomes in the upper six figures. And, I\u2019m ashamed to admit this, but they would be the first to criticize the dad for using food stamps to feed his family. There\u2019s a disconnect there that baffles me. I understand the $17 dollars. When all you have to live on until pay day is $5.36, your gas tank empty light is on, and your refrigerator is as bare as the sweater you\u2019re using for a coat, then things like paper towels, laundry detergent, and shampoo become luxury items. Even so, when the homeless person on the corner asks for a few dollars for a sandwich, it will not be Mr. or Mrs. Entitled who dig into their pockets for some change. It will be me.
