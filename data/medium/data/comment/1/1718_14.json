What I was trying to articulate is the notion that people hold themselves back in the healing process by hiding behind a label. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that I have anxiety.\u201d Or any variation. Even saying this to your internal self will create a pathway in your brain where it believes that to be true. For me, I had to stop believing I was or had anxiety, and start realizing that anxiety is an emotion before I was able to heal.
