Group all conservatives into the \u201cevil pile\u201d because somehow you see ANYTHING progressive as better? Who is the hater? Have you seen the \u2018home movies\u2019 of Rev. SS Jones, Baptist minister, from the 1920s?

Anyone can yell and scream in public, they do not represent me, as you assume. Millions like you, and me, grew up very poor, and just got on with life, helping others because we knew where that help was needed. Why let that ignorant human live in your mind? \u201cIf only we were more like Conservatives who believe everything they have today is a direct result from the sweat of their own brow.\u201d \u2026.and another crass and bigoted generalization lumping everyone into the same pile as that screaming woman.
