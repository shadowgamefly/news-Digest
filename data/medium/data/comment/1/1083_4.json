Single people and the elderly should foot the bill for maternity care and vice versa? That is part of the problem with health insurance and healthcare costs in general these days. Nobody pays for their own bill and very few even pay for the policy that pays the bill(majority paid for by employer). Which puts consumers in a position of only caring whether or not something is covered. You know how you cover more things that people actually want? Let them keep more of their compensation as a wage instead of a health insurance benefit. Increasing mandated coverages only increases the cost. It forces you to buy something, it doesn\u2019t force the insurance company to provide it. They provide it by selling you the product.
