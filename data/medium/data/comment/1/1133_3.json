I think there might be two different levels to the \u201cdebt vs liquidity\u201d question. One level is the one you\u2019ve been grappling with on Billfold: the level where someone already has some wealth accumulated and is looking at different options for building it, which might include taking on new and more debt. As you\u2019ve pointed out, that perspective may not necessarily feel relevant to a lot of typical people. There\u2019s another level, though, for people who are on that pathway of having some debt and thinking about how to structure paying it off\u200a\u2014\u200alike people may age who have some student loan debt, maybe a car loan, maybe some credit card debt, and maybe a mortgage (in certain markets and for some people, it\u2019s still within reach!), and also maybe starting out with saving in a 401(k) or an IRA. We have the question of what our monthly spending & saving should look like, and then what to do with any extra cash we may have. Emergency fund? More retirement savings? Pay off debt faster? One piece of the equation is how to make your money work for you\u200a\u2014\u200aI have a really low interest rate on my car loan, so that I\u2019m better off saving extra money elsewhere and just paying off the loan on the regular schedule. But the other piece of the equation is liquidity\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to make it through lean times by not having spent/stashed money in ways where you can\u2019t get it back. If I threw all my extra cash each month into my car loan, or into my mortgage, but then I get laid off, they\u2019re not going to let me take a break and skip some payments (depending on the terms of a specific loan). If I\u2019d saved it in an emergency fund instead, then I have it on hand. I might end up using it to pay off the same loan I would have, anyway, but I\u2019ve got flexibility. So the benefit of liquidity isn\u2019t only when taking on an entire mortgage or using it as a wealth-building strategy. It\u2019s not only for the rich. It can be applicable to an extra hundred bucks a month. ", "creatorid": "5ab317582854", "timestamp": 1490632302589, "child": "", "username": "amartin10"}
