I read your piece as arguing that we can\u2019t help but feel empathy, and so we know, deep down inside that college basketball is exploitative. But I\u2019m saying that many, many people, however much they love themselves some March Madness, don\u2019t feel empathy. Instead, they buy into the idea that unlike everyone else, college basketball players shouldn\u2019t get what they are worth, they should get what we say is \u201cenough\u201d and if competition among schools would result in them getting more, then by all means, we should stop that. When high tech firms got together and (as alleged) agreed not to recruit each other\u2019s employees in order to keep their costs down, the DOJ stepped in and got them to stop. The Court approved a large settlement to the affected workers. But when college get together and do the same thing, and worse, even when the Courts say it\u2019s illegal, no one has the stomach to change the system. I\u2019m saying that if there were empathy, as a society we\u2019d have long since demand change. The fact that you and I see the exploitation, but that we\u2019re in the minority, tells me that we have a long road to travel to reach antyhing close to empathy. Try this\u200a\u2014\u200ago to a party and ask people \u201cshould college athletes be paid\u201d and count how many people give you some reason why they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t. Then ask them if they can think of any other large industry where they feel that way, where the consumers should be able to demand the labor get paid less than their worth. I think you\u2019ll find your awareness of these men\u2019s humanity isn\u2019t typical. To my regret, yes, but it\u2019s what I have observed.
