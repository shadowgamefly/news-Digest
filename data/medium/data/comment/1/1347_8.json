Toxic on both ends, at least to math students. (I\u2019m studying to be a high school math teacher. Student teaching this coming fall.) Students who think they just aren\u2019t math people have the obvious obstacles, but students (especially girls, for some reason) who think they are natural math geniuses tend to fall apart when they get to a level of math that isn\u2019t easy for them. This usually happens in middle or high school. They apparently feel that they have reached the end of their abilities. Current research indicates that just about anyone can learn math, at least through undergraduate level, if they keep working at it. And almost nobody can get that far in math without some struggle. There is no \u201cmath gene.\u201d Students who understand that tend to do very well. But that first\u2026 Imposter symdrome isn\u2019t something we indulge in. It isn\u2019t something we can just ditch. I tried. Eventually, I overcame it. But it wasn\u2019t a matter of \u201cditching it.\u201d I was a successful industrial software programmer for years. I was in constant fear that somebody would realize I was faking it, that I really didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I tried really hard to convince myself that I was the real thing. I had the degree, I had the experience, I worked hard and smart, I produced results. Results I was proud of, and my boss and his customers backed that pride. I am not a particularly humble man. I knew on a rational concious level that I wasn\u2019t faking it, but on another level, I couldn\u2019t convince myself. Felt absolutely bizarre, trying to convince myself of someting obviously true, and failing. Over and over. I managed to keep going by reminding myself that my \u201cfaking it\u201d was producing results as good as anybody I considered \u201creal.\u201d I don\u2019t know exactly how I overcame imposter syndrome. I left the software business for other reasons, and went into a career with well-defined training and licensing. I can\u2019t see myself being convinced by a license when I wasn\u2019t convinced by results. But it probably helped. I think being able to see people\u2019s lives improved by my work was probably more important. And I went through a family tragedy (daughter died of leukemia) which knocked a lot of the bullshit out of me. But the main point\u200a\u2014\u200aimposter syndrome was not (at least in my case) some kind of attitude or self-deprecating afectation. I think it is as likely (or more) to have been caused by an undiagnosed alergy or something as to anything reasonably related to my abilities or the work. It certainly wasn\u2019t (in my case) caused by any discounting of my successes. ", "creatorid": "fc1937ae1a19", "id": "af05e1ba6ab6", "child": "", "title": ""}
