That book helped me look at my many life experiences and distill out what was really important to me. In my case, learning, writing, and explaining (or teaching). I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever fulfilled my ambitions perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200aor even adequately. But I know what I enjoy and I try to instill a little of that in everything I do. What was new to me (and equally important) was the concept of \u201cchoosing your inputs\u201d. Good food for thought. Thanks again.
