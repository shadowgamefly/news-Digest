That would put the onus on the conferences to determine their winner in any way they see fit (champion, vote, poll) leaving the committee to just decide between the submissions. 99% of the time the committee would then be deciding between the 5 entrants for the 4 spots (non power 5 conferences and at large could be considered but are unlikely to be worthy). This might encourage some conferences to slim down or provide promotion/relegation into A and B instead of the current geographic divisions. Hopefully it would result in more 1 v 2 matchups for conference titles instead of north vs south. This would probably make more schools beef up their out of conference schedule knowing that OOC games could be the tiebreaker in obtaining a CFP slot. I don\u2019t really care that this plan precludes the 2 \u201cbest\u201d teams from matching up in the CFP if they are from the same conference. It\u2019ll just mean more on the line for games like Michigan / OSU in the regular season. ", "creatorid": "dfd40e2a012c", "id": "837aadd186fa", "child": "", "title": ""}
