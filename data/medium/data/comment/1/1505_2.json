It\u2019s obvious from the clip that had Gobert been standing, the court was so wide open between him and the basket that it would have been an easy two points. He stopped the play. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb I get that teams on defense usually turn it up for the playoffs, reaching deep into their bag of dirty tricks, but come on. You can see Luc Mbah a Moute grabbing Gobert\u2019s shorts on the replay! This sucks! Hard contact was definitely intentional, even if taking out his knees wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m glad the Jazz won! Now all we got to do is take care of business at home to end the Clippers era! (Oh, and by the way, fix the tag. It\u2019s \u2018Gobert\u2019 not \u2018Gobart\u2019. Lazy editing.)
