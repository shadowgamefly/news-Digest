I\u2019m a higher ed person who got turned on to standards-based grading by some of my colleagues a couple of years ago and while I\u2019ve had some bumps in the road getting my system where I want it, it\u2019s been great, and I am never going back. It takes my students about 2\u20133 weeks to realize the benefits of the system and then they too are on board. At this point we have students going to their department chairs and asking why more professors aren\u2019t doing SBG. I have a lot of respect for K-12 educators who are doing this, because they have a lot more constraints than college professors do. We profs can basically do whatever we want in terms of grading practices as long as it\u2019s done fairly (of course) and it results in a letter grade somehow (university policy). Otherwise we have no excuses for not doing what you are describing. But K-12 people have to deal with multiple bureaucratic layers, neurotic parents, neurotic students, etc. So for anybody in that world reading this, please accept my encouragement to keep on doing what you\u2019re doing, and I hope that we profs can experiment and figure out some best practices that K-12 people can use, so we can make mistakes for you.\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "c57e507ff27", "id": "cab7ce62cf68", "child": "", "title": ""}
