However there were failures probably due to racism that did not address all of the issues related to the issue at hand. The law was passed by racist legislators to shut up the public, not to make anything equal. It\u2019s not that the law failed but that it didn\u2019t go far enough. It\u2019s like shooting a rabid bear with a pistol. It might make the bear leave for the moment but it didn\u2019t kill it and it likely pissed it off.
