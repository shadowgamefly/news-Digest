With people not having internet and regular hot meals. It\u2019s not about buying somebody a house, it\u2019s about doing the simplest of things like sitting down with a welfare couple and simply listening to them. With them, stock broking fees and your miserable money troubles is something abstract that don\u2019t exist. They don\u2019t want your money. I was feeling miserable as well the minute I started to make more money than needed, and I stumbled on a welfare couple I didn\u2019t knew. I don\u2019t know why, but I gave my number to the guy and since then I help them with very simple task, like repairing their old TV, faxing stuff, buying them some food once in a while, seeing them at hospital just to say hello, etc. You\u2019ll find out it\u2019s never about the money, but about being a human helping another human. The important thing is to just let go of social \u201ccast\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200alike forget to think \u201coh, she doesn\u2019t know I have millions, that I\u2019m that important\u201d. Your money doesn\u2019t mean shit if your unable to leverage your altruism, for free, without any return of investment in time. Poor people also want to help, but just not with money. Let them help you. This welfare people bought me spaghetti pasta and a Duncan Hine cake to say thank you for helping them fixing Christmas lights and showing them how to make a budget (they were drown in phone bills and eventually got out by themselves)\u200a\u2014\u200ajust say thank you, even if you feel it\u2019s dumb, it\u2019s not. This is the real redistribution of wealth, helping your neighbors without them asking, just a little bit at a time. You\u2019ll grow even richer on the human side. And don\u2019t need to do this all the time, a simple hour from now and then. A drop in the ocean that makes a difference for both you and them\u00a0;) Cheers ", "creatorid": "312a205c14fa", "timestamp": 1488035051507, "child": "", "username": "king.demoiselle"}
