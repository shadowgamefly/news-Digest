Having 4 grandkids I have had to alter my lifestyle quite a bit. Especially when it comes to rules and boundires and how I set them. Before life as a \u201cPapa\u201d as I call it my rules and boundries were set pretty strict and I didn\u2019t have room for compromise. Some of that was due to work and some due to lifestyle. Then after a 10 year refresher in life I kind of let my rules and boundries down a little. Kind of had too! That didn\u2019t make me any less soft, but a little more understanding. Then grandkids came and everything went to s***! Only kidding. What happened is I learned to become a negotiator without losing ground or too much ground. I learned there was a better way to set rule and boundries where both sides feel a win. That was especially important for the little ones. As you stated \u201cIf you have to hold the line, you\u2019re better off doing it before the anger builds.\u201d This is 110% of life!
