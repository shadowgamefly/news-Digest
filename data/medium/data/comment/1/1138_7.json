My ex sounds a lot like yours. I am still paying, despite having all of the debt paid off because it\u2019s taking forever for my credit score to come up. I\u2019m trying to purchase a home for myself, but despite having no credit card debt, and no collections, I can\u2019t seem to get approved for a mortgage.\u00a0I will never trust a man enough to surrender my finances or career ever again.
