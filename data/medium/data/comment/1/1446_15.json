I\u2019m not sure I entirely buy the notion that the feelings about the present are untethered from facts. The argument here seems to suggest that MAGA would be an unbeatable slogan in any campaign or era. For example, the arc drawn could, logically, apply to 1932 or 2008, when the nation faced a sudden crisis and, commonsense would suggest, was interested in \u201creturning\u201d to the pre-crisis times of glee. But my suspicion is that this slogan would feel emotionally \u201coff\u201d in those times. That feeling arc wouldn\u2019t actually fit the facts of that moment. I\u2019d argue, actually, that a key difference between Trump\u2019s campaign and FDR\u2019s (1932) or Obama\u2019s (2008) is the role of fear. I actually don\u2019t think that Trump was really praying on fear or anxiety. Psychologists define fear/anxiety as a response to a threat where the causes and solutions are unknown. By contrast, anger is a response to a threat where the are known. Trump was playing on anger, not fear. He was saying we have problems, and we know exactly what to do about them. We just need the will to do them. This is most clearly invoked by his claim that politicians are \u201call talk\u201d and \u201cno action.\u201d This role of certainty\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is critically tied to facts of the situation\u200a\u2014\u200ais not shown in the narrative arc, but I think should be. Trump\u2019s narrative was inspiring because it was \u201caccurate\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ait reflected how people felt in 2016. But MAGA is not always going to work.
