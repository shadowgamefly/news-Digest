That\u2019s assault, and it\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s why eleven people were arrested. I got my Psychology degree from NYU. I\u2019m truly disgusted that this is being legitimized in NYU Local. A crime occurred on our campus. A speaker was physically attacked because someone didn\u2019t like what they thought he would say. People in black masks prevented someone from giving a speech that he was invited to give by your fellow students. This is truly pathetic. Have some backbone, use the education you\u2019re blessed to have, and condemn this atrocity. ", "creatorid": "b8b45cf3b6a0", "id": "5bbc10710a8e", "child": "", "title": ""}
