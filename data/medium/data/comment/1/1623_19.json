Saturday: $4.32 on drugstore things, $4.50 on kettle corn for my mom, $5 tip at a diner, $5 for parking Sunday: $18.77 on sunscreen, candy, and a giant bouncy ball (judge me.) $1.50 on a dress for my sister at a thrift store. $28.49 on lunch with my siblings. $12.99 on a laptop sleeve. Total: $109.40\u200a\u2014\u200aI did come in under budget, but I didn\u2019t buy groceries like I planned.
