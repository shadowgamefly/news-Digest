In my particular case I write because it makes me happy. Just the sole action of writing, organizing my thoughts, and crafting eloquent paragraphs. I enjoy sharing my experiences and helping others learn from them. I value good content \u2014therefore I hate clickbait\u2014 and I strive to create articles I would enjoy reading myself. I have a good job at an amazing company with an incredible team. Writing is not a must for my career, I could be as successful without it. But I do it for one reason: joy and fulfillment \u2014yeah, technically two things, but a single emotion. ", "creatorid": "a9b235640750", "id": "3ecbf880a29", "child": "", "title": ""}
