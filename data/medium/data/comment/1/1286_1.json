I thought 1 and 2 sucked but gave TD a chance and I\u2019m better for it. I haven\u2019t bothered with the others because I was never emotionally invested in Walker\u2019s and Diesel\u2019s character but Lucas Black was fun to watch. I am glad that somehow someway Han lives on. He\u2019s a great character.", "creatorid": "5b2fd0447a9c", "id": "604d11ec16ab", "child": "", "title": ""}
