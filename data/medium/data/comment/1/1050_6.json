It really awful language with no real future. I am pretty sure all JavaScript developers will get to hell, due to irrational CPU and memory resource usage. Sorry. That\u2019s was a joke. You can earn money quickly money with JS\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, this is advantage. A lot of software packages in JS are written by people who even don\u2019t anything about algorithms and don\u2019t know how computer works. That\u2019s was my opinion, if people like JS I don\u2019t mind\u00a0:) But JS world is lost for me. Personally I use JavaScript in different amount for 15 years and always JS was a source of problems and bugs.
