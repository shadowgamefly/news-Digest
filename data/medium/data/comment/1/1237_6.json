That\u2019s why I created Fresh Darlings\u200a\u2014\u200abecause elsewhere on Medium positive feedback or no feedback is the norm. So Fresh Darlings offer a space where it\u2019s understood that a full range of feedback, including constructive, is welcome. Medium\u2019s limitations on format are so frustrating! That\u2019s actually one reason I\u2019ve been publishing less here recently\u200a\u2014\u200abecause I\u2019ve been trying new work that explores mid-line gaps, indents etc. and I can\u2019t do that here. Medium is a simple and pretty elegantly designed platform, but it\u2019s also obvious that it wasn\u2019t built for poets. Thanks for your insightful comments!
