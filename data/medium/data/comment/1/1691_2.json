I could not agree more with everything you\u2019re saying about the current state of the NCAA and the many ways in which it denies athletes their rights. However, I don\u2019t believe that simply offering a sound argument for why things should be a certain way will necessarily catalyze change (and in this model, bring about the empathy I describe). That impulse needs to come from somewhere and it\u2019s frequently the result of a shift in public opinion. For this to happen, there needs to be a some mechanism for the average fan to start thinking differently. I\u2019m merely suggesting that basic empathy might be that starting point. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being overly optimistic here. If anything, I\u2019m pessimistic\u2014if this is the avenue for change then obviously it hasn\u2019t taken hold yet. But we simply don\u2019t live in a country where you can convince people that huge institutions must be reformed by appealing to their most reasonable selves. To make the public acknowledge that rights are being violated, they first need to care about college athletes as people. They need to be reached on an emotional level first. That\u2019s why I brought it all back to empathy. ", "creatorid": "9304ec9a5713", "id": "977c7b1178d6", "child": "", "title": ""}
