Laws are not cruel for giving you free stuff for a period of time and then realizing that laws should not be giving people free stuff. Laws can be cruel for taking something away from you but that is not what is going on here. Theft is an immoral action no matter if it is in a dark ally because you think the person has too much money, or if its two people voting to have the government take the money of a third person because they think he has too much. Individuals are cruel for not taking care of other people in need. If there are people in need, YOU should absolutely help that person to the extent you are able. That is called CHARITY and that is what the action of giving people stuff they need but have not earned is. The government is not meant to be a charity. You need not pass the personal responsibility of caring for the less fortunate to others by making your government your strong arm henchman. Less crying and more check writing. The Republicans should 1. Delete ObamaCare\u00a0..in full\u2026.period. 2. As a completely separate action, Address Insurance and Medical expense affordability. 3. As a completely separate action, address any charitable programs that would meet the needs of those who can not afford reasonably priced insurance. This could range from tax law to encourage charitable giving, expanded programs such as Planned parenthood (for actual medical needs outside of being an abortion mill), Charity hospitals similar to the VA and so on. Sadly, Republicans are as stupid as the Democrats are irresponsible. ", "creatorid": "5d24d22e753", "timestamp": 1490128845327, "child": "", "username": "TxTigerFan"}
