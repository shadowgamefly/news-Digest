I spend a LOT of time in my notebooks, and I constantly assess how it\u2019s working for me. I\u2019m constantly fine-tuning my system. Right now, I\u2019m working out of two notebooks, one\u200a\u2014\u200aa Leuchtturm1917 dot grid\u200a\u2014\u200ais my planner/self-development journal. That covers a season, so I\u2019m in my spring notebook right now. I have my routines, goals and plans, a daily reading section, and then daily planner and reflection pages that I draw out ahead of time each week. The other\u200a\u2014\u200aa lined Moleskine\u200a\u2014\u200ais a general notebook/journal where I capture everything not related to specific projects that have already earned their own notebook. For projects that I\u2019m taking just past the initial page or two idea stage in my general notebook, I buy $1 8x5 notebooks at the local dollar store, a couple dozen at a time, and each project gets its own notebook. If the project is a novel, character notes, plot notes, scenelets, and bits of dialog that come to me will go in there, as well as dated notes on progress and intended direction as I\u2019m writing the novel. For other projects like business planning and creating courses and such, the notebooks hold plans, research, etc. for those, as well as the dated entries so I can pick up where I left off. I\u2019ve got a raging case of ADHD and I\u2019ve found that keeping copious notes about what I\u2019ve done and where I intend to go on a project means that if my interest trails off and a project gets left for months, I can come back to it, read through my notes, and pick up where I left off as if almost no time went by.
