We try to have enough conversations going with potential clients that we can say \u201cno, thanks\u201d to clients who are in too big a rush to take a few deep, thoughtful breaths before plunging in. I don\u2019t know your market, but in our market we see both types of clients: the thoughtful ones looking for a design partnership, and the ones in a rush, looking for implementers to carry out their already internally decided plans. No disparagement is intended to the latter group. Many times such clients are reacting to business pressures, and sometimes, no doubt, their plans are right on. But we see design as a lot more than implementation. We see it first and foremost as strategy. And we look for clients who share this view. We don\u2019t always land them, but we try. I recognize that we\u2019re in a somewhat privileged position because our market contains both kinds of clients, and also because we are somewhat known for what we do, which helps us attract the kinds of clients we wish to work with. But some of that privilege comes from years of hard work and good word of mouth\u200a\u2014\u200amaking it not so much privilege as something we work hard to earn. If your studio can begin working with even one or two clients who hire you to do research first, and if you can talk about those projects, word will spread and, over time, you\u2019ll get more of them. Good luck!\u00a0:) jeffrey ", "creatorid": "355cb93fe914", "timestamp": 1492000079537, "child": "", "username": "zeldman"}
