I have seen shades of a monster in me. I have been the nightmare that wakes me on some nights. How can I be anyone\u2019s comfort when I am the terror they run from, just veiled by a thin mask of perfunctory politeness? Can I be my mother\u2019s son instead of my father\u2019s, maybe that might save me?\u201d Your words resonate with me and I feel the pain in your heart Oreoluwa. But rest assured that there is hope as long as you are not afraid to find help and keep your heart open to goodness and mercy and shut out evil. You may feel incomplete and broken, but you need not stay that way! May you find the Divine and the Good and true way ahead for your life! Thanks for sharing this!
