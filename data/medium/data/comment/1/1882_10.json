Language of all types should be romanced and not censured. Certainly there are times and places for various forms, but to take on the perspective that not using profanity brings clarity is absurd. Of course speaking deliberately and focusing on the specific verbiage you are espousing makes one more conscious of language. Try going a day without saying \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019 and you will find the same effect. It will increase your conscious efforts to select phraseology which either does not use those words or the use of substitutes for them pressing your conversation into the frontal lobe of the brain (function) versus the amygdala (emotion). Truly, that is all your experiment with \u2018cuss words\u2019 is doing. Profanity has nothing to do with your fucking willpower. I swear it doesn\u2019t. \ud83d\ude09 ", "username": "mistano", "parent": "1882"}
