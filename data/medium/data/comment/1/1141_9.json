When I brought up the double taxation issue to my HR representatives, their response was that our defined benefit would be calculated to account for the fact that we were previously taxed on our contributions. So perhaps our defined benefit formula is more generous than is typical, to make up for the fact that we\u2019re being double-taxed? Either way, we\u2019re being taxed on those contributions and then we\u2019re also having the standard amount of tax withheld from our paychecks. I set our withholdings quite high, so we still got a sizeable return this year\u200a\u2014\u200ajust not as high as it would have been if I\u2019d done my homework and accounted for the extra $7K.
