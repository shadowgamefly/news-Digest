We get ourselves bogged down using 3rd rate approaches costing valuable energy. I dont care which one because they are both unacceptable. We are being manipulated into believing the current approach for healthcare has been scientifically concluded and we are left with only two choices, just like we are trained to believe we only have two choices in POTUS elections. But why? A third party would fuck up their greed and entire scheming system. From what Ive seen these are the two most important issues: Regulate price to stop absurd abuses like charging a patient $600 for a bottle of saline that cost less than a dollar. We will never find a solution for universal coverage until this is corrected because the entire structure is based on profit, not people.Universal means universal, so in this respect the major difference in O/Tcare are the prices and not quality and equal access. If Im a Trump supporter I would respond by saying: \u201cRemember autism? An increase in frequency did not prove it was the primary cause of the stats. What about texting and driving? After the ban went into effect some states saw an increase in car accidents, which made the road more dangerous.\u201d We should have universal coverage based on population and not pictures of dead presidents reminding you they are not slave masters, but only enhanced labor training. If we cannot, as a nation, realize why our neighbors deserve healthcare in the right of Life we will not resolve the issue.
