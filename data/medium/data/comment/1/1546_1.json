Any time anything bad happened or if my anger or anxiety was too much, I would just sit on the beach, quiet and the sound of the waves, the salt scent of the sea would calm me down. I\u2019d feel the rage dissipating in the wind and I\u2019d be brought back to myself. The sea\u2019s my actual medicine :-)", "creatorid": "8674b3f3509b", "id": "6bc80751edce", "child": "", "title": ""}
