I agree that \u201clife is the bucket.\u201d I am a uterine cancer survivor. My up-close and personal appointment with mortality turned my carefully nursed decades-old grudges into will-o-the-wisps that disappeared in a flash. What a relief to find that those thoughts and feelings don\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of my life! I also appreciate your analysis of the evolutionary purpose of cancer. Before cancer I had always believed in a causal relationship: you smoke, you get lung cancer, etc. The true happenstance of cancer in myself, friends and family has dispelled that belief, but begs the question you addressed. What is the purpose of cancer? Thanks again for sharing your process with us. ", "username": "jeanninebee9", "parent": "1884"}
