You didn\u2019t even want that coat anymore, what you wanted was the closet space. Sure, you could have sold it at a garage sale and made, like, twenty bucks. It was an expensive coat, damn it. But you, with your heart of gold, gave it away.\u201d In a paragraph immediately following complaints about how $17 could ruin you? I have been there. My childhood was pretty bleak, when the average balance of my parents\u2019 checking account was $50 at most\u200a\u2014\u200awhen both parents were even alive. When we legitimately ate Wonder Bread and Peanut Butter for a week straight. When we ate nothing but gifted food and neighbor\u2019s pity casseroles because my father died and left us penniless. When sewing was the only option, because new clothes cost too much. That \u2018charity\u2019 saved us money, and allowed us to spend that $20 on something we desperately needed more, like food or an electric bill. How do you not understand that voting for social progress has a long-term effect but won\u2019t put food on the table tonight or tomorrow? Clearly you think you understand the value of $17, does the matter of time and financial deadlines just escape you? Charity helps *now*, not in days or months when something actually comes of a vote. Don\u2019t go saying \u201cYou\u2019re not a good person for donating your things\u201d. That\u2019s like slapping the hand of the person giving you a free PB&J sandwich because you wanted Ham & Cheese instead. ", "creatorid": "f6cd206670d", "id": "a6161fb39335", "child": "", "title": ""}
