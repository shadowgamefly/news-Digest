I\u2019ll write something on history every week this year. On the Civil War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, and political skulduggery. History has the broadest definition of any academic discipline. I\u2019ll push that definition a bit. But first, let me disclose that I\u2019m no historian and haven\u2019t played one on TV. History is about stories. I prefer stories outside the traditional bounds of historical inquiry. I love digging up the kind of stuff that falls through the cracks of the official records. Stories of weak men, strong women, bad dogs and drunken horses. Subversive ideas, quaint notions, great insights and colossal blunders. You know, things worth reading about. Anyway, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m (gulp) committed. ", "username": "grahamwrites", "parent": "1869"}
