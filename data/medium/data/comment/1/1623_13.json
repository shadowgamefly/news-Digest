Friday- relaxed at home and made something for dinner that must not have been too exciting, because I can\u2019t remember what it was. Saturday- my dad texted at 7:45 to ask if I wanted to go to the beach. Yes. Did that and then got a late breakfast (dad paid; I got the $5 tip). Went to a barbecue for the rest of the day (brought a salad made from groceries bought earlier in the week). Crashed at home early, tired from the sun and drinks at the barbecue. Sunday- beach again (it was nice out) and then bagels ($6). Then went to meet a dog and ended up taking him home (adoption fee not included in this estimate). After that, basically spent all afternoon running around getting a tag and food ($50) and ordering a few things online ($109 on top of a $30 amazon credit). Sandwiches at some point in between dog errands ($14). So, somehow only $25 on items unrelated to the dog, but $159 on the dog for $184 total ($34 over estimate, but I also did not get shoes, which I really need for work). Did not sleep well and am SO EXCITED, so I do not see this being a very productive day at work. ", "creatorid": "4e249ec55f41", "id": "b341aafa71e8", "child": "", "title": ""}
