Dinner with Husband-elect\u2019s friend and his fiancee was actually just drinks (I thought it was a restaurant, but it skews much more bar-ish and they didn\u2019t have meal-level food), so we stopped and got Arby\u2019s on the way home. I paid, because I was starving after my thrift adventures ($6.27.) Then on Saturday morning we lazed around until I decided I wanted pancakes. We used a Yelp deal for a local breakfast place\u200a\u2014\u200abreakfast for two cost $6 on top of the deal value. It was gross and cold and rainy, so we decided to go see Deadpool at noon at the cheap theater($3.50) before heading to the library to pick up Ant-Man on reserve. It remained gross outside, so we kept up the Marvel movie theme for the day and watched that too (I really liked it\u200a\u2014\u200ait filled in some blanks in my MCU knowledge.) Sunday I talked to mom, then we went to the gym. Hit up the grocery store on the way home, $31.36. Went home, did some cleaning and took a shower with my new rose-jam scented shampoo bar(I want a food that tastes like this shampoo smells), then went back out so Husband-elect could look for cheap boat shoes at DSW and Kohl\u2019s. There\u2019s a new Panda Express in the same shopping center as those two, so we went there for lunch because we\u2019ve never tried it before. I am not at all sure what the big deal is, it was underwhelming at best and cost $18.32. We went home and I did more cleaning, plus for dinner we FINALLY made the buffalo chicken and potatoes we\u2019ve been planning for like three weeks, plus a cucumber/tomato salad with tahini dressing and cilantro. Ate while watching Bob\u2019s Burgers, went to bed before 9:30. Estimate: $55/24.67. Actual: $90.12. At least I kept it under $100?
