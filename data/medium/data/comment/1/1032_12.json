By representing you\u2019re content in the way the user is asking for you are providing a better experience. Why aren\u2019t other big websites doing it? Good question\u2026 maybe working with rems on a giant website or application can\u2019t be justified due to increased overhead with impacts to design, development, and testing\u2026 All the other big names are doing it, no ones going to shame them\u2026 yes pixels will get the job done. When you are letting a custom font size of the browser adjust the sizing of your content, breakpoints in pixels will let you down. It\u2019s basically like zoom without the zoom. Without setting breakpoint in rems when sizing in rems you\u2019re break points are going to get weird when custom fonts are used. I know a lot of people are going to read this article and be like \u201cYEAH F*** EM REMS!\u201d Yes, using rem\u2019s is more challenging that using fixed units, but hey at least they gave us rems to work with instead of ems. If rems don\u2019t fit for you don\u2019t use them, but please don\u2019t try to discourage others from trying to make the web a better place.
