With Kirby Smart defecting to Georgia, Muschamp playing the role as (the other) USC\u2019s latest UF\u2019s cast off and Tennessee at least having a recruiting renaissance with Butch Jones, the argument may be that SEC talent has just become more diffuse across the south. Even a diehard SEC fan will admit the average team within the league is worse this year. In the West: Arkansas sent an entire offense to the NFL (2RBs, TE, QB, 3OL), Miss St lost the best player in its history, A&M had 2 different 5* QBs transfer, Ole Miss sent arguably the best WR in college and one innovative (at least from a recreational marijuana usage perspective) DE to the pros. Auburn and LSU still don\u2019t have QBs. Auburn might be better this year (low bar), but every other team in the West is rebuilding in some form or fashion. The permanence of the argument that the conference\u2019s days of dominance are numbered seems overstated, but it\u2019s unquestionably down this year.
