The problem is the vagueness, or being too general. I would say it like I already did it, and of course that ends up backfiring. So now I mostly keep my big goals to myself and only share the milestones that I\u2019m trying to achieve. If my goal is to run a marathon, then I end up telling my wife or friends that I plan on running for two miles a couple times this week. Then it\u2019s four, then eight. Pretty soon they might say, \u201cWow, you should just run a marathon.\u201d And I\u2019ll smile. ", "creatorid": "f161ac4985e", "id": "2e10927b1813", "child": "", "title": ""}
