Congrats, OSU beat a galactically overrated(as usual) Oklahoma that got blown out by Clemson in the playoff and Houston last month. That said, I happen to agree that Urb is a fabulous coach(last year\u2019s MSU game notwhithstanding) and recruiter. His coaching acumen seems unreal as well. I recall listening to him do color on a few games in between coaching stints(after Florida, I believe). He would call out the play and exactly what would happen as the kids lined up to snap the ball. It was great to be treated to that sort of real value-added analysis. But you did get carried away\u2026:) ", "creatorid": "decba683aaa3", "id": "e797c79a5b74", "child": "", "title": ""}
