Yet over the last 5\u201310 years, as the quality of quantitative research and exchange traded fund options has grown and evolved, the old school premise of indexing and buying and holding balanced funds, and the sheer size and promotional message promoted by the indexing industry, may drowned out an investor\u2019s opportunity towards investment in other, more modestly presented alternatives that may produce larger, risk managed terminal asset growth into the spending phase years. The use of stock universes that have produced highest returns premia, as proven academically, is a reasonable start. Add a systematic, low turnover tactical asset allocation strategy and use low expense ETFs representing the underlying universes and let it run it for one / a couple / few decades and allow the \u201ccompounding\u201d to work (isn\u2019t this kind of the way that hedge funds are supposed to work\u00a0?).
