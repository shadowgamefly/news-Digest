It\u2019s empowering to think this way. However, there are those people who are appalled at the thought of choosing to be born into such a family. It\u2019s easier to feel like the victim of a bad situation than it is to empower one\u2019s self. There is a scene from the 1987 movie, Overboard, where Goldie Hawn\u2019s character, who has amnesia, is sitting on the stoop of a rundown house. She questions out loud to herself, \u201cI didn\u2019t marry well, did I?\u201d I love this scene because even with amnesia she still owns up to what she believes is a choice she made for herself.
