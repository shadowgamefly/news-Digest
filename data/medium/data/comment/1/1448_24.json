Early on you use the business/marketing language of developing a \u201cpersonal brand.\u201d Later you suggest: \u2018I believe that the people who are willing to discuss their journeys instead of trying to front themselves as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d are going to win.\u2019 Discussing a personal journey and developing a \u201cpersonal brand\u201d are radically different quests, both in substance and form. The marketing intent of building a brand is to stand apart as more attractive or appealing. A good brand does this by being perceived as uniquely relevant to the consumer. Creation is the mechanism for plying the work in a manner that smartly packages your perspective to reflect and extend their perspective\u200a\u2014\u200alike stepping outside of your skin and briefly climbing into theirs. Doing this well translates into being authentic (the opposite of \u201ctrying to front\u201d). Simply documenting one\u2019s personal journey is less likely to fulfill this mission for several reasons. For one, the average journey of the average person is apt to be mostly mundane. In unskilled hands, it\u2019s also prone to come across as self-indulgent rather than audience-centered\u200a\u2014\u200aand the more you do it the more underwhelming it gets. After all, how many people want to entertain someone else\u2019s proclivity for constantly talking about themselves or listening to their ho-hum stream of consciousness? Frequently documenting a personal journey for public consumption\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to keeping a private diary\u200a\u2014\u200asimply adds to the din that already clutters our current communications. When you\u2019re forcing or rushing the work in this manner it does a disservice to everyone, including the author. Converting your personal journey into something genuinely thoughtful, meaningful and unique, on the other hand, stands a better chance of imparting the kind of value that promotes a signature voice. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one must wait until it\u2019s perfect\u200a\u2014\u200abut that you invest in a process of creating and refining the work until you\u2019ve got something worthy of gaining a toehold (creating promotes personal growth by converting information into knowledge; documenting merely amounts to keeping a historical record). Perhaps you can release the content in shorter, less frequent but stronger increments\u200a\u2014\u200aand use the shorter increments to develop momentum for a longer term rhythm and flow. If you do this well, the accumulation of content over time will leave a meaningful footprint instead of more din. Finally, notice I earlier said \u201csignature voice.\u201d I actually hate the idea of turning oneself into a \u201cpersonal brand.\u201d It implies that a person be viewed as a commodity\u200a\u2014\u200aor worse, a disposable commodity. Nothing robs us of our common humanity faster than being treated like an insentient thing, such as a commodity. From a societal standpoint, this is truly dangerous territory\u200a\u2014\u200aamong other things, it threatens to breed an indifference toward one another (if it hasn\u2019t already). Strive to develop your presence through a signature voice\u200a\u2014\u200arecognizing it takes time, work and, above all else, creating one.
