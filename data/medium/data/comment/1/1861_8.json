I always find it interesting and more than slightly amusing how the amount of followers a writer or publication garners, automatically equates to that writer or pub being the best. Like there is some unyielding, proportional equation that says more is more. Period. As far as Medium is concerned, I\u2019ll take Audrey Hepburn\u2019s advice over Tiffany, and agree that less is most definitely more. Certain pubs may have high 5 figure followers, but I don\u2019t care how many followers you have, if the depth of your insight is 7 ways to multi task-while step-climbing-at the gym, I\u2019m going to be blunt and suggest that perhaps you need a new metric to define quality and value. Lastly, I find the potential benefit of anything Tiffany writes has been forever tarnished after her blatant plagiarism of more than one article. Listacles no less. Something she has never taken responsibility for, continuing to deny and justify her actions to this day. Which is actually kind of sad, since how flat does your creative inspiration have to be to resort to stealing mindless \u201clife hack\u201d bullet points? ", "username": "alto", "parent": "1861"}
