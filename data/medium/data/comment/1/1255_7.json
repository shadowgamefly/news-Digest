When we die the flesh decomposes, and returns to dust; the spirit returns to its source, God, and the soul submits to HIS judgement. There is one life per soul, but the spirit which is eternal, may come down here many times to guide other souls around. Hence, when some soul claims to have been here before, that soul\u2019s memory may be reviewing the many journeys of its spirit. How else to explain why so many peoples\u2019 claim to be Cleopatra, Napoleon, Julius Caesar, Queen Elizabeth, Alexander the Great or some other great historical figure. You never hear of anybody claiming to be some joe schmoe. It\u2019s always some historical celeb. However, in one of his Books, Edgar Cayce, the great America prophet, claims to have been a pioneer who was scalped by an indian on a river bank. He meets a child by a river, and the child says to him, \u201cI remember you\u2026remember by the river.\u201d When Jesus talks of saving your soul, HE is talking about saving you! Hindus believe in reincarnation, and all of these anecdotes about previous lives tend to reinforce belief in it. But, I\u2019m always mindful of Jesus, when HE says, \u201cI am the truth, the way, and the life.\u201d To me that says there is only one life for the soul, for me, and Jesus is the only door to eternal life. You start believing in reincarnation, believing you\u2019re coming back down for another shot at life, you\u2019re deluding yourself. All of us get one shot down here, just one, and when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s done. Your spirit may come back guiding another soul, but you certainly aren\u2019t.
