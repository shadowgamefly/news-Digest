The ego\u2019s method of living forever. First we invent a personal soul\u200a\u2014\u200aan indestructible version of our mortal mind/body. Now my ego can believe it will live forever as Ghost-Vinnie. This imaginary spirit-person needs a place to live for the rest of eternity so we must invent Heaven and Hell as the two options. This gives the ego immense pleasure as it envisions living in constant bliss in a perfect place, while all his enemies are roasting in a place a safe distance from him. Safe from the ego\u2019s fantasies is the One Spirit, who I am. Eternal, ever alive and with everything to give to a world lost in the darkness of self-imposed separation.
