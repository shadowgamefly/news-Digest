( One of the effects of wage gap in pay wages.) I couldn\u2019t get paid enough in one job to cover a household, I needed the second job to fill gap. Being the type of worker who cares about doing a good job at work, my second job grew in hours not pay. When I finally gave up my car, thanks to one of my places I worked out buying the other. I chose to stay working at the job closer to home with same pay rate but a higher job position. I got to keep the pension so I got 2 pensions at retirement plus Social Security. (not that I am raking in the dollars) I earned every dollar I get. Sleep deprivation is real, a body wiil only function so far without sleep. I had to keep moving to stay awake and I was not always the most pleasant person to be around. (think growling terrier). Now that I can sleep 7\u20138 hours at a time I do, and my mind thanks me. Today\u2019s economy doesn\u2019t allow enough time for relaxation time. ", "creatorid": "74352c82bfc", "id": "520a2831231d", "child": "", "title": ""}
