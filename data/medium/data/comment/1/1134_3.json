Unless the eggs are collected every day by hand, the chickens may still have to go through a similar mechanical egg-collection process to support any kind of volume production. They\u2019re just allowed out of the cages when they\u2019re not producing eggs. When it comes to \u2018organic\u2019 or \u2018free-range\u2019 I truly believe that the only really safe option is to buy locally from a farm where you can see and know their methods. I have an inherent distrust of the marketing aspects bestowed upon those concepts by brands sold through large corporations.
