But I don\u2019t think this means that AIs won\u2019t be able to do emotional work in the future. Especially, as Linas Vepstas mentioned, if AI replaces the logical work of today, people will (hopefully) fill in the emotional labor. With a generation of presumably more emotionally capable programmers, emotionally intelligent AI is a natural next step. I just hope they\u2019re built with many ethics considerations.
