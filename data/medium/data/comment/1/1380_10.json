Poets don\u2019t expect to make money. TS Eliot was a bank clerk. Wallace Stevens was an insurance executive. WC Williams was a country doctor. But prose writers deserve better. They labor longer and harder. Not that poets don\u2019t work hard, but a thoughtful, organized, sustained piece of prose is a time consuming labor, even setting aside the creative aspect. Being expected to do it for free is just wrong. My two cents. ", "creatorid": "d43b48bc4c6d", "id": "fa6eb78b7cdc", "child": "", "title": ""}
