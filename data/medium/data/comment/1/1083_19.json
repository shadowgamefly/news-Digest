Yes, you have to help pay for some services that you don\u2019t need or use. That\u2019s the whole idea of insurance- we all pay in, it spreads the risk, so if you need it, the costs won\u2019t (in theory) wipe you out. If healthy people don\u2019t participate, the whole thing breaks down. And you know, even healthy people can have a disaster. A friend of mine recently picked up some random thing on a camping trip, ended up with a case of endocarditis that nearly killed him. He\u2019s been sick since October, in the hospital for a month now, had a stroke and open-heart surgery. He\u2019s 46, a runner, and until that trip, was very healthy. Dudes, it could happen to anyone.Don\u2019t want to pay for pre-natal care? It only affects women? Hmm. It seems to me that a pregnancy requires male participation- why shouldn\u2019t men pay for part of it? Unless they want to agree to stop having sex, and make pregnancy available only by parthogenesis\u2026It seems to me that this whole thing is a pretty clear example of what the right-wing thinks of women and their sexual behaviour. First, They don\u2019t want to pay for pre-natal and maternity care. But they sure don\u2019t want to pay for an abortion, either! They don\u2019t want to help out a single mother, but they also don\u2019t want to cover married women. *And* quite a few of them want to cut and/or eliminate contraception coverage and availability. (There is in fact a movement to revisit the Griswold decision and overturn it.) So face it- they don\u2019t want women to have sex. Sex must be punished. Unless, of course, you\u2019re a Russian hooker. ", "creatorid": "c68480536989", "timestamp": 1491672067332, "child": "", "username": "liutgard"}
