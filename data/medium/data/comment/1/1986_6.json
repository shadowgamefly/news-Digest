The biggest upset was 12 over 5 (middle tennessee state) but that 12 was favored in Vegas anyway and everyone had them winning in their bracket. The other ones, Wichita St, Xavier, Rhode island were all expected to win as well. USC over SMU was the biggest surprise probably. More importantly, their were only 3 or 4 close games.
