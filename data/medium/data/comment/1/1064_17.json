So the hard work The EPA has done over the years is to be thrown out with the bath water? Who will check the fracking, the coal ash dumped in tho the stream which lead to the reservoirs from which we drink? 3% of the earths waters are fit for consumption of that 1% is fit for drinking. Look at the rest of the world, most places do not have any water that is fit to drink ( there for diseases ) We want to waste what we have? The aquifer under the middle of the US is a glacier from the last ice age, it does not replenish it\u2019s self from ground or rain water. In the 1970\u2019s you drill a well and get water 12 foot down, today you need to go 2, 3 4, 5 6 hundred feet down to get water, it is not being replaced. When it goes there is no more, there for no more wheat/corn belt, bread basket gone! Oh my fortune for just a drop to drink. So yeah let\u2019s get rid of the EPA pollute as we want to I\u2019ll just drink wine ( whoops forgot that needs water also! ) Dummies ", "creatorid": "7de6f7158cfe", "timestamp": 1488056220149, "child": "", "username": "dacoover1"}
