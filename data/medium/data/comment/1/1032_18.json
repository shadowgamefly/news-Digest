The web is by and large a text medium. Relating sizing to text gives designers and developers a more direct connection to the relative scale of elements on a page (e.g, 1rem is \u201ctext size\u201d, 3rem is \u201cpretty big text\u201d, 35rem is \u201ccompact paragraph length\u201d, etc.). When we\u2019re mostly trying to size text and fit text in boxes, a text based unit conveys proportion without the need for mental conversion.Pixels encourage fiddling. Anyone that works with designers is familiar with the \u201ctry it one pixel bigger. Now smaller. Now bigger\u201d conversation (I admit I was guilty of this in my past life as a designer). Pixel fiddling wastes time, with no significant benefit to the end user or business. Rems are chunky units\u200a\u2014\u200athey naturally guide people away from minute adjustments. In companies I work with we usually say \u201clet\u2019s stick to 0.25 increments for sizing and spacing unless it\u2019s a really special case\u201d. The time and mental energy saved with this rule have been more than tangible, especially when paired with elimination of modular scale or sizing variables.
