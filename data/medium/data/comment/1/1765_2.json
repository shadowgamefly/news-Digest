That \u201cConstitutional technicality\u201d is THE WAY WE ELECT THE PRESIDENT! It isn\u2019t a \u201ctechnicality\u201d at all. It is the ONLY way to win the office. And she didn\u2019t win anything \u201cin a landslide\u201d. A 2.1 percentage point advantage in any vote count is far, far from a landslide. Of the 48 elections where we actually had a total popular vote count, her margin of victory comes it was the 10th lowest. \u201cThe mandate is unquestionably hers.\u201d Yes, the mandate to go back to NY is all her\u2019s.
