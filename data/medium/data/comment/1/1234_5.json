I don\u2019t necessarily think what all the big companies (i.e. facebook and twitter) are doing is a trend. I feel like they usually err on the side of usability rather than the new trend, due to the exorbitant amount of daily users to their sites/apps. I think they try to solve the design problem in the clearest and simplest way possible. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they add innovative features to their products, but usually for the first pass, it is a clear implementation and then later gets redesigned once users understand how to use the feature.
