What\u2019s really sad is Republicans spent so long hating on Obama care, when they could have been using that energy productively to produce a new care act that out shined his. They had 4 years! Do the math, 360 x 4! All those days yet they still only give us this garbage? It\u2019s the best they can come up with? I know they can do better! Someone has to have some common sense that now is not the time to be playing around with people\u2019s lives on the line! These are real human beings who have family and friends who wanna see them live a long healthy happy life. Key word: LIVE Some people go through life without living, struggling just to get by. They need this care plan to work so they can be covered and live happily with their family going on vacation without stressing over financial issues. Remember: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Let them walk out the hospital room without stressing out over bills, so they can have happiness. Personally I feel that if both parties come together then they can sort out a true plan that helps and saves everyone. With low rates and no one looses coverage. Republicans need to give up on their act for now and then sit down with democrats so they can talk it over to form a bi-partisan healthcare plan to benefit everyone and will easily get approval from the Senate.
