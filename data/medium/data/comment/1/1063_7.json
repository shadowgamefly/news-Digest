It is dishonest to describe these people as \u201cconstituents\u201d but I suspect any writer representing an organization called \u201cThinkProgress\u201d is motivated by agenda not honesty. Republican politicians have historically done a better job of outreach to their constituents, bypassing DC lobbyists and big labor bosses by conducting \u201ctown hall meetings\u201d. Rather than conduct their own outreach which often results in some uncomfortable questions from citizens, the Democrat strategy is to disrupt Republican town halls in order to foment dissent and present the appearance that large numbers of citizens are upset. It has the extra side benefit of shutting down free speech by out-screaming any thoughtful dialogue. These tactics, while immature, can be effective when there is true injustice, but the current progressive narrative isn\u2019t resonating. Maybe because secular progressive policies aren\u2019t working, maybe because Americans still believe accepting government handouts is weakness, or maybe because rudeness and bullying cloaked in political correctness are seen as a bigger social problem than transgender bathrooms or anthropogenic climate change. In any case, this is a blatant piece of propaganda, aimed at repeating and legitimizing a lie. Droves of angry constituents were heard last November, this is just political theater.
