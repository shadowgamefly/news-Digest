Thank you for consistently creating value. I love this post, and I just saw this exact idea in action. Let me affirm you\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re spot on! I just got back from vacation. Yes, vacation is always good\u200a\u2014\u200agetting away and taking a break. Slowing down. But this one was different for me. I didn\u2019t have the usual \u201creturn dread.\u201d While walking the beach and hearing the music of the waves and the wind, I realized that there is music all around me. No, I may not have a beach at home, but there are small moments that call out to me every day. Often, I don\u2019t take the time to listen. Vacation reset my thinking in that way so that I was actually excited to put some of these things into practice when I got home. Thank you for sharing this! I really appreciate you and your writing. Keep up the good work! ", "username": "aaroncharles18", "parent": "1883"}
