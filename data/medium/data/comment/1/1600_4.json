I\u2019m speechless, totally blown away. Yup, I\u2019ll read this again and again, and hope to retain some semblance of your piece and put to it to use in my life. You\u2019ve said so much, too much for me to absorb all at once. Being a Christian seems relevant now after processing just the initial reading. Wow, Jonas, you\u2019ve cracked through the wall of conventional Christian language and meaning that I\u2019ve taken for granted and dismissed for most of my life, and now I\u2019m beginning to see the light through that crack. Thanks a bunch. ", "creatorid": "dc334d1b298b", "id": "99263c9ee4ab", "child": "", "title": ""}
