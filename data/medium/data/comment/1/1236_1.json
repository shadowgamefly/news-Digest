I totally believe in not projecting on the poem, but considering what it seems to be driving at and giving feedback that would strengthen the poem\u2019s direction. Easy to try to suggest things to our own taste, but really misses the point and isn\u2019t very useful. I have training as a social worker, and a lot of your ideas dovetail with active listening and reflecting they teach you as a counselor. Especially restating what you are getting from the piece so that they can better understand, in an impartial way, if the reader is getting what they were intending. Glad to have you writing with us this prompt! And always\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "b30670cb98f7", "id": "d3823ffbf3b2", "child": "", "title": ""}
