I remember wearing that \u201cI don\u2019t need sleep\u201d badge with pride\u2026 it was almost a rite of passage as we left university, entered the business world in demanding professions (like strategy consulting and banking), and climbed that daunting corporate ladder. But, I am also now painfully aware of the cost of doing that for so long with so little understanding of the impact on my family, my relationships and my own health. It has affected each one of those in profound ways. I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m better, now that I\u2019ve made real changes in my life to put my health first (not all of the changes were easy or voluntary) \u2013 and confident that I\u2019ll be able to maintain that perspective in the future. My wish is that I can pass along this learning to you and others \u2013 my children first and foremost \u2013 so that everyone has the awareness to make different, and hopefully better, choices than I did. Thank you \u2013 for giving a voice to this important issue and giving us the courage to tell our stories too. ", "creatorid": "a2ebaf5ebf34", "id": "375a9a197b7", "child": "", "title": ""}
