In general, I try to use \u201cborder\u201d only when talking about a layer while it is still in Sketch, and \u201cstroke\u201d when talking about the resulting SVG. There are numerous places in the article that sound like they could be referring to the SVG elements, but where I\u2019ve used the word \u201cborder\u201d specifically to describe them in their still-in-Sketch/pre-export state. Also, because borders turn into strokes during export, any mention of \u201cinside/outside\u201d should always be followed by \u201cborders.\u201d I\u2019ve gone back and revised one sentence where I didn\u2019t adhere to this distinction, and I\u2019ve admittedly left a couple simplifications near the beginning of the article before I (briefly) acknowledge the difference between borders and strokes. I wanted to introduce the topic quickly before getting into terminology. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being nitpicky\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s an important distinction and can be useful when precisely describing the pre-export or post-export state of a design!
