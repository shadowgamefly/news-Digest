Children are amazingly forgiving over time, the best thing you can do is to show your children that changing yourself is a positive thing to do, personal growth is a desirable thing and making mistakes is far far better than always being right. I don\u2019t mean make them insecure, stability has its place but giving good role models that are realistic about life and its successes and failures is far better than trying to get it all right. from Releasing your Child\u2019s Potential by Sylvia Clare ", "creatorid": "c78d8bead359", "id": "19ad34fe6aa9", "child": "", "title": ""}
