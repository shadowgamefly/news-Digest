I can understand how you could be upset by that sentence. I don\u2019t believe that all suburban Republicans fondly recall a less integrated lifestyle and want that lifestyle again. Just as I don\u2019t believe that all coal miners remember the halcyon days of coal mining and want to live those days again. Just as I don\u2019t believe all Christians fondly recall a time when Christianity was unquestioned and pine for that time again. Some/many Republicans don\u2019t care about integrated schools, some/many coal miners would rather work in solar, and some/many Christians think the idea that Christians are persecuted is bunk. But IF a person wants all-white schools again, or coal mining again, or a Christ-fearing nation again, THEN \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d works for that person\u2019s predilection or prejudice. But that\u2019s not the point. Even if I only impugned *some* suburban Republicans, \u201csome\u201d could mean *any*, and \u201cany\u201d could mean *all*. By suggesting that some suburban Republicans might make decisions because they fondly remember a less integrated lifestyle, I may as well have said all of them were like that. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that were your conclusion. Why should you assume I don\u2019t mean any malice? After all, it\u2019s the internet. We don\u2019t know each other. There\u2019s nothing in our relationship to temper negative assumptions. And I think that\u2019s really the point. We\u2019re not neighbors. We\u2019re not friends. We\u2019re just temporary acquaintances in a brief moment of time, connected by screen names and a topic in common. We\u2019re not even in the same temporal space: you commented hours ago, and now you\u2019re doing who knows what. I\u2019m commenting now, typing from who knows where. On the internet, everyone is a ship in the night. We\u2019re all ghosts to each other. And so, with so little at stake, the internet makes it easy to see other people\u2019s lifestyles and judge them. It so easily moves us to binary and antipodal positions. It removes the \u201cskin in the game\u201d of arguments. By simply opening a browser, one judges and feels judged. So if you felt like I was unjustly attacking a group of people, or attacking you, I understand, and I am sorry. I hope to see you again soon\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "251b58260c76", "id": "b3ed00c824aa", "child": "", "title": ""}
