Ridley suffered this year because Jalen isn\u2019t the best passer in the universe yet. A true freshman can\u2019t throw as well as a senior, go figure! It\u2019s really unfortunate because the guy works hard. You just do not see Jalen throw the 2\u20133 over the top deep balls the last few QB\u2019s were able to do to like Amari or Julio or even Ridley previous years. We will win either way because we are the Death Star of College Football, and I don\u2019t see anyone named Skywalker on Clemson.
