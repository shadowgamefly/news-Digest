But, wait, maybe you are being held captive, and someone is forcing you to read my un-cute posts. If that is true, let Medium know and they will send someone over to your place to end this torture. No one should be exposed to malarkey they find horrible and not funny. My goodness, Michelle, I am so sorry for the abuse I put your through today and for forcing you to moralize in my direction. I\u2019m going to stop now and pray to the dark gods that the Medium police arrive at your door before my next post reaches your inbox tomorrow morning. Just take deep breaths until then. And stay strong. \u2013AI ", "creatorid": "a95f5352e2fc", "id": "a20504eaef7b", "child": "", "title": ""}
