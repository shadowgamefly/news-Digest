Big fan of your work and all you bring to the Medium community. Definitely agree with you surrounding the pitfalls of the Author\u2019s tab on toppub.xyz. So much in fact, that I almost deleted this portion of the article before I pressed Submit. As someone who only uses Twitter to thank people who share my Medium articles and who has almost 12X more Medium followers than Twitter followers, this metric is largely irrelevant to me as well. From a seamless onboarding perspective, I totally get why Ev and the Medium team made it this way, but excited to see more telling metrics roll out in the future for Medium writers. I\u2019ll check out the articles you linked up here. Have an awesome day! ", "creatorid": "11df7f829bc1", "id": "ff37b34643e4", "child": "", "title": ""}
