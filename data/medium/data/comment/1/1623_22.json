I\u2019m trying to replace my current pair of slip on sneakers (they are similar to Sketchers, but different in important ways that apparently only I appreciate and I was beginning to go a bit wild out of fear that I\u2019d be stuck buying and returning shoes for eternity). So I subjected myself to the outlet mall and found two pairs of the exact style I wanted for $75 total (buy one get one 50% off deal). These should last me at least 2 years. I was only at the mall for about an hour, but of course did not get out without purchasing a few slightly unnecessary, yet discounted, t-shirts. I will wear these t-shirts until they fall apart, but I definitely blew my estimate. Probably $130 total at the outlet mall. $40 farmers market (I\u2019m out of town half the week, but bunnies still need salad). $40 fancy lunch on Sunday (that includes a $10 cocktail which I didn\u2019t need but it\u2019s been a while since I splurged on booze). $210 ugh ", "creatorid": "cbf64fa69e7a", "id": "21a99ce1fe49", "child": "", "title": ""}
