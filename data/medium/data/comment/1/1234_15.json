I was glad to see that I have already gotten this design advice before in my career but it is always good to be reminded of it. I remember reading Bruce Mau\u2019s Incomplete Manifesto for Growth years ago and he had pretty much the same advice (including quite a few other one\u2019s). It was a very inspirational read at the time and I\u2019m sure younger designer\u2019s today, who may not have heard of Mau\u2019s manifesto or similar writings, will be greatly inspired by reading your article. If I may I\u2019d like to add a bit to your presentation advice. I have done this for years with great results. I call it \u201cdelayed first impression\u201d. First I present individual UI components separately (like the navigation, forms, tables etc.) and then move onto either the killer feature or widgets of the website. The last thing I do is present the front page of the site because by that time I will have walked the client through each element of the site and when I get to the front page the client will have gotten the whole picture and understood the process of how the design ended up the way it did. Thank you again for a great read\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "a902b7f81064", "id": "6ed1e72d5450", "child": "", "title": ""}
