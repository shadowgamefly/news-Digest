One note about toppub.xyz and their top writers section\u200a\u2014\u200athis ranks Medium authors by their number of followers, which is positively correlated with how many people read their work, but only part of the story. Since anyone who follows you on Twitter will also immediately follow you on Medium if they have a Medium account when you sign up, a lot of celebrities who rarely write still have a ton of followers. I say this because I don\u2019t want readers to become discouraged by these leaderboards. Some of the best writers on Medium don\u2019t yet have much of a following. But their work can become extremely popular anyway. For example, Marc Andreessen has nearly 200,000 followers, and all he did was republish on Medium a few of his tweetstorms in 2015. Contrast this with Benjamin P. Hardy who\u2019s Medium following is literally 10x his Twitter following. Benjamin has invested his time heavily in writing on Medium, and it shows. He wrote more top-250 articles than anyone in 2016. Some quick examples from our nonprofit\u2019s publication (freeCodeCamp): benjamin bannister wrote about typography at the Oscars and his article has been viewed more than a million times, even though he has less than 1,000 followers. (You should definitely follow him\u200a\u2014\u200ahe writes great stuff.)Gil Fewster wrote about Google\u2019s artificial intelligence breakthrough, and got more than 600,000 views even though he only has 1,300 followers. (Gil\u2019s one of the most creative technology writers on Medium, and worth following.) So again, even if you\u2019re coming to Medium without much of a Twitter following, you can still reach a lot of people with the right article. Just keep researching and keep writing!
