Obviously, random is difficult to achieve, if you use only software, but that\u2019s a whole different point\u2026 BUT: Random also works just with characters. \u201cqJAMLxGaTS\u201d is also random (I used a script to generate it), and secure. Of course, no one can remember such a combination, but if you use numbers and symbols it just gets even worse without a real advantage as I wrote in my article, just have a look at the graph. This is why it doesn\u2019t make much sense to require numbers and symbols making everything way harder to remember. \u201cBastian1\u201d is truly not a very secure password as it\u2019s derived from my name, but using something like \u201cbamastth\u201d is. I can easily remember this as I just mixed up the words \u201cBastian\u201d and \u201cMatthias\u201d. As there are lots of words out there and the attacker can\u2019t know how you mixed yours it\u2019s pretty secure and easy to remember. (There are other dangers like \u201cSocial Engineering\u201d but again, a different topic\u2026) To sum it up: using numbers and symbols won\u2019t bring (much) more security to your password. E. g. GCHQ has some advices how to create passwords here https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/gchq-password-advice (There\u2019s a link to the original source, the article explains some concerns about password managers as well) ", "creatorid": "ad22c1a9e732", "id": "db590da9a147", "child": "", "title": ""}
