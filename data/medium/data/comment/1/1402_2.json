I did not want to wake up start my day at 4 AM, but it meant more to me that my husband got a good night sleep. I definitely did not want to be sitting out in the pouring rain immediately after waking up, in the cold and darkness of the night, but it made our cats calm and happy. I chose this title because I love both my husband and cats dearly. If I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t have gotten up before the alarm clock went off.
