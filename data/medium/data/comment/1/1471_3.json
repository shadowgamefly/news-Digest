Congratulations you bought a watch attached to a marketing device. These things are more of a PIA then they are worth. My guess is that they are like gym memberships, 80% plus of them are used for the first month or two, and thereafter lie dormant and sap your bank account and show up in your email account to pedal other items to you. Someone gave me one for Christmas over a year ago, I think everyone was more excited then me, because I had no idea what it was, If I knew it electronically tracked me, I would have never opened the box\u2026.I hate being tracked. Why does everyone have this obsession with knowing where I am, what I am doing,\u00a0\u2026 I forgot, you want to sell me something! Every app on my phone asks me for my location.. NO, you are like a boss I once had, I finally told him I was in the john of my choice talking a big one\u2026no more stupid questions from him! Why can\u2019t my APPs take the hint!
