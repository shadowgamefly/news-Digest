This is because we are made of the same stuff as the universe! This means the universe splits whenever a particular dense part of the universe (us!) reacts and maintains state about some QM event. Does that mean inside other dense areas such as Stars and Blackholes there could be even more splitting because we humans aren\u2019t anything special?? I can\u2019t help but use Occam\u2019s Razor and suggest that QM Universe Split is too far fetched. There is a fourth option, our observable region of space is part of the infinite universe and there are infinite universes. This is the basis of Max Tegmark\u2019s Multiverse Theory which I personally find appealing. Thanks again.\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "c728b3a9d4b", "id": "81a763f8ba", "child": "", "title": ""}
