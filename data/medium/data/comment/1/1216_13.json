To the world, they see me and my mom and think it\u2019s this super duper tight knit relationship. Talk about living a lie. I love my mother with every ounce of my being, we don\u2019t have \u2018that\u2019 kind of relationship. Mom and dad are both at arms length due to the damage they\u2019ve caused. Sadly, they both act as if they\u2019ve done nothing. I still long for the deep connection with one or both of my parents, but have accepted the history.
