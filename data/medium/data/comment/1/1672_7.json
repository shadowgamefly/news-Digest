I think you kinda took a shot at Aj Hammonds. He was a lot better than lethargic. I cant figure out who i compare Caleb to. I thought maybe Ben Wallace, but he\u2019s not there on the D. What i do know is that there is a place for him in the NBA. Guy\u2019s like Frank Kaminksy have carved out nice little careers playing hard and using there leverage and taking advantage of certain matchups. Caleb will get there. Oh ya that guy he nearly put on his ass Happ, will probably be a common name in the Big 10 for the next 4 years. I hope as a Boilermaker fan, Caleb stays for another year. I love what i\u2019m seeing. ", "creatorid": "4795ff2b389d", "id": "e237f373b7b3", "child": "", "title": ""}
