I find the first two tips a bit more difficult to apply to fiction/creative writing, even though you can strive to use them. Of course you still need to have a topic and a premise for fiction (what the book is about) but it tends to be more nebulous and the writing itself takes you in more unexpected directions. Often you don\u2019t really know your REAL topic until your second or third draft, when the story starts getting more depth, complexity and echoes. At least that\u2019s my experience. While non-fiction (with the exception of memoir, which shares a lot with fiction) is more straightforward. I write both fiction and nonfiction so speaking from my experience, which may be different from yours. ", "creatorid": "d429ae8ad2c1", "id": "c7c1c7e33ea1", "child": "", "title": ""}
