Even if accessibility was limited to testing for vision impairment, it\u2019s a hugely diverse group of people with a huge range of strategies and software for using interfaces. Just closing your eyes and going \u201cso this is what it\u2019s like to be blind\u201d is\u2026 not much cop. It\u2019s good to do your own testing, but there are standards, guidelines, and related tools based on extensive research for a reason: you sitting for half an hour fudging at an interface with the Tab key and Voiceover running isn\u2019t going to tell you much by itself. :| \u201cAnyhoo, all that aside, the rem example is clearly the best here.\u201d I agree. :| \u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018better for accessibility\u2019 argument blown out of the water, now moving along to\u00a0\u2026\u201d But you just said\u2014never mind. :| \u201cIt explains (accurately) that by using a combination of rems and ems, you can create a component (say, a modal window) that can scale to different sizes just by changing a single font-size on the root element of the component.\u201d Yeah, and if you combine em units with viewport units, you can create a minimum font size, like\u00a0:root { font-size: calc(1em + 1vw) }`. :| \u201cIt makes sense. In the same way that \u201cif you often murder people, it is handy to carry a shovel in the boot of your car\u201d makes sense.\u201d So, what you\u2019re saying is an elegant solution to a common responsive design challenge (things should appear proportionately smaller in smaller viewports) *is like murdering people*. May I be the first to say that this comparison is somewhat tenuous? ", "creatorid": "fbee25a1f240", "timestamp": 1491318409874, "child": "", "username": "Heydon"}
