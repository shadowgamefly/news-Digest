This, of course, would be the role of propaganda like Kipling\u2019s. I\u2019m tempted to divide Kipling\u2019s life into \u201cpro-war\u201d and \u201canti-war\u201d periods as well but I don\u2019t know enough about his life to feel comfortable with this projection. I wonder if he had harbored criticisms of war long before John\u2019s death, and only when his son died did he validated in breaking from his conservative, publicly held opinions. This is purely speculative, but you can see how as a reader in today\u2019s society, this kind of apologist thinking would make it easier to identify with Kipling\u2019s work. As far as the idea of being pro-imperialism yet anti-war, this seems like the kind of idealist thinking that an imperialist government might wish to impress on its people to minimize the depiction of war. I\u2019d be interested to hear a historian\u2019s perspective here. Namely, I\u2019m curious if war is considered a necessary mechanism of imperialism, and therefore the two cannot actually be thought of as distinct. Anyway, I\u2019m clearly missing a lot of historical context, but for me these are the kinds of questions that reading Kipling raises. ", "username": "dsfish", "parent": "1878"}
