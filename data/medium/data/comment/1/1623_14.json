(a more violent image than usual for me, but I need the oompf) Friday: Ended up going home, partner wanted to go out for happy hour: $20 and $20 for take-out to eat at home. Saturday: Went to excellent Japanese for brunch/lunch, $30. A small grocery run (including the transit tickets) for dinner supplies, $45. Returned defective BP cuff to Walgreens, fastest and most efficient Walgreens interaction that has ever happened. Sunday: walk in the morning, $4 on coffee/tea for walking. Partner had rehearsal, I went to Sephora ($40 for a replacement lipstick/Smith\u2019s Minted Rose Lip Balm/a new lipstick) and Lush, $30 (Beard Wash for partner, bath bomb as treat for partner because baths are calming him a BUNCH right now, and solid shampoo replacement for me). Partner was feeling spry, so we got a beer at TRVE $14 and Illegal Pete\u2019s to take home $16. Total: $219. Cardiologist appointment today for partner, we\u2019ll be able to make plans for this summer after this. Please send all good and healing thoughts our way!
