Friday I did dinner at home, Saturday I wanted to hang out on the beach with the dogs but the marine layer didn\u2019t burn off until like 4 pm, so I took them for some very long walks throughout the day and just hung out and read all day while my husband was sailing. Sunday I went to field hockey and killed it. Got lunch in the middle of the day won 3 out of 3 games. Two were for first place (womens and mixed divisions) and I won the third place game (mixed, so I stopped men\u200a\u2014\u200aHA) in a shoot out. The low spend weekend doesn\u2019t feel like a win though, because this weekend we noticed that our hot water heater is leaking so my husband is meeting a plumber as I type this to see what the cost will be to replace it.\u00a0:( ", "creatorid": "970f35920510", "id": "edc6999e53b4", "child": "", "title": ""}
