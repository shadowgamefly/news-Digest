What would it be?\u2026\u201d I want nano-tech digesters that breakdown and separate all trash back to raw materials on a molecular level, eliminating the need to, pardon my French, rape the earth any further. By mining landfills/the ocean gyre, we would reclaim sustainable manufacturing and protect what remains of nature, as long as production factories also upgraded to enviromentally protective practices. This kind of nano tech seems like a priority over all other applications. What point is life-saving biotech if we destroy our gorgeous paradise planet? ", "username": "good.for.you", "parent": "1974"}
