When I hear \u201cHealth Savings Accounts\u201d and tax breaks, I have to throw up. People that make 50 grand or less, which is about 85% of working folks, will never be able to save enough to cover serious illness. I had a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery, which resulted in a total of over 1/4 million dollars.
