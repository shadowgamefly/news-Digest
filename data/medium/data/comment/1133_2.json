After a year of coming out of the closet and trying to rationalize my feelings, I am FINALLY getting to the point where I feel a little less compelled. I have accepted and can fully feel femininity as part of my fluid sense of gender. I don\u2019t need the dress anymore to be my doorway to that experience. I am more calmly aware of all the reasons you don\u2019t see many women in dresses anymore, too. Being a fairy tale princess is cool, until you feel the gilded cage that is usually the other part of the story. ", "title": "", "parent": "1133", "creatorid": "347fa936159e", "id": "1c9d2d747bfa"}
