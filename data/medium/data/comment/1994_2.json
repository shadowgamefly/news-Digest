I still have some issues with sketch that is making this workflow not 100% possible yet, at least for me, there are still some missing features that harm this new way of building components and working with a library of elements, not everything you need is already available, masking an element and font settings are not as I wanted it to be, it should mimic more CSS concepts. I think we are taking a step into that new workflow but I'm afraid not all the things we need to make it happen are already available today. Hope sketch can get better and better and notice that feature needs so they can make them real in the next updates and we can make this new workflow work 100% as we need.
