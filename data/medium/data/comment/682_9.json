{"name": "682_9", "child": "", "content": "Wise advice, but what is happiness? We all have a slightly different definition. The reason most people don\u2019t push through to their ideal life is because normal, even if it\u2019s terrible, has a seductive power. Just follow along and you won\u2019t be forced out of your comfort zone or (it seems) have to face the world\u2019s black swans. Thus, they often don\u2019t even realize what their definition is. Some never leave their corner; some decide what they need to be happy on a surface level but don\u2019t get it; some do get the perfect job, the loving spouse, or the lottery winnings and then see that it wasn\u2019t what they needed at all. How does a person find their definition so they can take the right actions to get it? ", "title": "", "parent": "682", "creatorid": "3544e02e239e", "id": "d46010760095"}
