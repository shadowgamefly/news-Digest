Its seems like a lot of data analysts are promoting Harden and basing this on reasons of \u201cefficiency.\u201d But the underlining assumptions and what exactly is efficiency and the benefits of this and problems with measuring such things of efficiency on the basketball court are never actually mentioned/discussed/anlayzed. It appears as though theRinger has bought into this argument, mentioning Harden for MVP (consistently) under efficiency arguments, but I dont think the writers actually understand or have crtically engaged with what that actually implies.
