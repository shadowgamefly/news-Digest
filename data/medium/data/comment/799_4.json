{"name": "799_4", "child": "", "content": "Very interesting point. I suppose the other fallacy is not knowing when that s curve starts to peak, right? Nevertheless, as a writer, I sometimes wonder if that means the books I write are just another product or if some of them are in the realm of art (I know, I know, bear with me\ud83d\ude4a). And as far as art is concerned (especially in today\u2019s world which seems more than willing to commodify it), what does the curve look like? What about art as a single piece (think a painting by Picasso etc)? I\u2019m guessing the same rules don\u2019t apply? And, again, back to writing, would treating ones work like a single piece be he wise choice? What does that look like? Genuinely asking what you and others here think.
