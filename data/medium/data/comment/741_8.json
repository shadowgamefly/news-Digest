{"name": "741_8", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for your thoughts, Katharina! Maybe it\u00b4s important to emphasize that this is not supposed to be a new model for DT, it\u00b4s a descriptive model that is based on existing thoughts with the goal of bringing them together. As Lisa Carlgren and her co-authors state, there is a need for a description of DT that is not just focussing on one aspect such as the process, but one that illustrates the richness of DT. And I totally agree with her, as I experienced over and over again that DT gets reduced to just an accumulation of methods or the like. So, based on mentioned research and my own experience, I tried to provide a comprehensive description of DT, no more no less, with the hope that it helps people to better understand DT\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "741", "creatorid": "313e17c195d1", "id": "d95678a80c0f"}
