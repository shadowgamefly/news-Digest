I do see my parents, girlfriend and others frequently locked on their phones looking for idiots entertainments and just wasting their times. Even being from Tech, I intend to find some solution to minimize the time spent on mobiles, in a more productive way. Now I\u2019ve reading and watched a lot about philosophy in order to try to understand the human behavior among the society and I found out some similar points as wrote in this article, like: most people may think technology is just positive, that we must to pay attention to everything posted to ours timelines\u00a0or\u00a0that\u00a0we\u00a0must\u00a0to\u00a0answer\u00a0everybody\u00a0in real time they mention us\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0on.
