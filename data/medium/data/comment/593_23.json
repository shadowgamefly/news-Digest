Their second try of Ping aka iTunes Connect is the weirdest social network in that it\u2019s only accessible inside a music app, not a browser. Their other services\u200a\u2014\u200aiCloud, Mail, Maps, iWork all follow the same pattern: heavily polished app-like\u2122 interfaces that\u2019s ported from their original app version to the web, with core features that\u2019s solid in its own right, but won\u2019t ever talk to other entities on the open web like their competitors. Can you imagine an Apple Map that can actually be used by other websites with an extensive API and active crowd-sourced editing community like Google Maps. How would such a product evolve as fast as their web native competitors? More money buying more accurate data? Living in a second tier metro area in the states, every time I accidentally opened its maps from messaging app or decided to give it another chance after a upgrade, I would get directed to the wrong location or an inefficient route, almost every time.
