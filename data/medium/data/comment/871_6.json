{"name": "871_6", "child": "", "content": "Started playing Thimbleweed park this week, featuring Ransome the Clown. Not scary, just angry. Kinda like Don Rickles. Insults are his business. And then there\u2019s this observation at Ethics Alarms\u2026  10. A stark lesson in cognitive dissonance: The Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus, which for decades used head clown Lou Jacobs as its symbol,\u00a0..now minimizes the visibility of clowns to the vanishing point. The clowns are a small troupe, and act like rodeo clowns. The costuming and props are minimal. There is no little car, no extended clown skits. Moreover, Lou Jacobs\u2019 style of clown, the classic whiteface clown, is gone. So is the Emmet Kelly-style \u201ctramp\u201d clown, presumably because it is politically incorrect. All that are left are the \u201cauguste clowns,\u201d like these\u2026  This is how the cognitive dissonance scale works: whiteface clowns can\u2019t be funny, because the associations with them are now sinister. I grew up with whiteface clowns like Bozo, Ronald McDonald, Lou Jacobs, and Clarabell the Clown on \u201cHowdy Doody.\u201d Then came John Wayne Gacy, the real life serial killer clown, and Tim Curry\u2019s terrifying Pennywise in \u201cIt.\u201d Adults, like \u201cSeinfeld\u2019s Kramer, displaying fear of clowns became a running gag, and kids got the message.
