All Democratic decisions should occur in alignment with the Constitution, not in spite of it or in some modern, malleable interpretation of it.. If there are actions that are not in alignment with the Constitution, I am firmly against it whether it is of Democrat or Republican origin. Simply being against laws because you do not like their outcome\u2026well that is the role of Democracy. If you don\u2019t like laws or the actions of representatives, vote to change them.
