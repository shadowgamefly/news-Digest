{"id": "ddfecb4856a", "content": "Other than the tribute, nothing about Fast 7 tops Fast 5. And while the original is fantastic, and still holds up, Fast 5 is just too chock full of GOAT moments. Such as: Best fight (Dom vs Hobbs) Best set piece (bank vault chase along with Oceans 11 style vault switch) Best soundtrack (The moment when Danza Kuduro starts playing as Luda opens the safe is timeless) Best buddy cop movie duo (Tyrese trying to show out in the epilogue only for Luda to STUNT ON HIM HEAVY SHOUTS TO BOONE PICKENS) Best ruthless moment (Hobbs no look execution to avenge his team) Best plot twist (Letty being alive even after they gave Dom a new love interest so it really did seem like Letty was dunzo) Dom\u2019s THIS IS BRASIL!! (idk what category to put that in, but it\u2019s awesome) And finally the greatest moment in the franchise. The Avengers Assemble moment. The culmination of 4 films bringing together all of your favorite characters into a balls to the wall explosion of fanservice. Oh and the fact that it happened in the movie that introduced ANOTHER god tier character (Hobbs) is icing on the cake. Fast 5 can\u2019t be touched ", "creatorid": "ed6db1456b61", "title": "", "parent": "21", "child": "", "name": "21_2"}
