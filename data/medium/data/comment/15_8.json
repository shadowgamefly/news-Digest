{"content": "\u201cSilicon Valley may finally be making urban farming viable.\u201d I can name several urban farming initiatives in Tokyo that started over a decade ago and between that time and now, initiatives throughout the Caribbean and Africa and Latin America before 2010. This is not inclusive of urban rooftop farming that been around for quite some time. Why is Silicon Valley injected as some kind of \u201cwhite knight\u201d and I mean that with the full \u201cwhite privilege\u201d intention of what I see is driven here. There is no Silicon Valley money/investment needed to grow urban food or engage in urban farming as humans already have the land and seeds to harvest crops for survival. This article and possibly this publication may be shilling or creating fake hype narratives of Silicon Valley, a place that excludes minorities and women from contributing to innovation as some kind of magical place we all need. Silicon Valley has nothing to do with making urban farming viable, the work has already been done\u2026.plenty of urbanists as well as colleges and universities are making urban farming viable and the best way to make it viable is not have it overloaded with \u201cVC funding\u201d debt from some Silicon Valley investors using math-based illogic to justify the lack of diversity among themselves.
