{"name": "799_15", "child": "", "content": "Nicely done, Abhishek. Another aspect of the innovator\u2019s dilemma is related to Theodore Levitt\u2019s Marketing Myopia ie knowing what business you\u2019re in. Blackberry got hit by two tidal waves at once: ubiquitous availability (mobile) and the consumerization of IT. Blackberry prized control and security over ubiquitous access. They thought that was what the market wanted. And a certain segment did want (and continues to want) those features. However, that has been dwarfed by organizations who prize ubiquitous access. I lived consumerization of IT and it\u2019s impact on Blackberry. I used to be a RIM reseller and sell, install and manage Blackberry Enterprise Server. One day, the CEO of one of my customers got an iPhone (circa 2010) and said \u201cWhen will I be able to use my iPhone for my business email?\u201d That was the tipping point for Blackberry. They didn\u2019t recognize the need for convenience over security. ", "title": "", "parent": "799", "creatorid": "f81278734e43", "id": "97e9bfd5e49d"}
