{"child": "", "parent": "2090", "content": "There\u2019s a bus service that runs from Sheffield railway station, almost past my house, and on out into the Derbyshire Peak District to the small town of Bakewell. Going one way or the other the bus diverts to call at Chatsworth House, a stately home (actually, a palace\u2026.). Somehow that trip to Chatsworth has got onto young Chinese students\u2019 tourist guidebooks, and the bus is often full of Chinese students long before it gets to where I live and I can\u2019t get on. But that\u2019s OK\u200a\u2014\u200awe just wait for the next one. And here\u2019s something really cool\u200a\u2014\u200athe bus company has installed a system on (some of) these buses that makes announcements in mandarin, because the drivers certainly don\u2019t speak mandarin and not many of these students speak English. Mandarin announcements on a bus in Yorkshire\u200a\u2014\u200anow that\u2019s what I call an unexpected result. ", "creatorid": "d600f07e5af6", "id": "2ac0e167ebca", "name": "2090_18", "title": ""}
