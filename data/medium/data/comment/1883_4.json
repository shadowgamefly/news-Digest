{"name": "1883_4", "child": "", "content": "I get the challenge. It is a struggle, but I believe that the struggle has moved on throughout the years. We have moved from oppression to suppression and now we are in the age of impression. In this age we (black people) get to choose our response and we have a voice, which was not afforded in the past. We can\u2019t judge intent, nor can we decipher internal feelings. We have to determine for ourselves if we have been insulted or if we are taking offence and adjust our posture to suit. Some years ago I resided in a predominantly white town, inasmuch that people would stare at me as I went about my business. I raised it with one of my white colleagues, who responded, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just because you\u2019re a good looking guy?\u201d There are just other universal attributes that define me as an individual, other than my skin colour, ethnicity and cultural mould within which my worldview was initialised. I acknowledge white supremacy but my view is that we are as guilty of perpetuating it as our white brothers and sisters, if we allow our posture to break and slouch under the weight of impression. The weight of impression inhibits us from taking risks, disrupts our neural processing and stutters our articulation, all of which are keys to success in the valley.
