{"name": "411_21", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for adding to the dialog, and great perspective. It would be great to understand your thoughts on how we change the course of music education today to be more inclusive of the full spectrum of means. I say this as someone who grew up in a working class family in the rust belt in the 70's. I can proudly say that the exposure I had growing up in music education was far superior than the affluent suburban schools of today. Get this\u200a\u2014\u200awe had a full time music teacher in our grade school! This meant that a bunch of working class kids all got to learn how to read sheet music and the basics of playing instruments (1) without their parents having to pay anything and (2) learning this life-long skill during the school day. As a parent looking back at how I grew up vs today, I fully agree that we\u2019ve regressed as a society when it comes to music. You are spot-on highlighting the overemphasis on presentation and stage acts over technical performance. The challenge is what to do about it. While I wish that every primary school could go back and hire a full-time music teacher, that\u2019s likely not going to happen. What can happen is using technology to build the tools that enable teaching the basics for free and at any time. That\u2019s what I have put out on Alexa, and hopefully it will help any age student to get started. Once they\u2019ve gotten the interest, they can go to you and others to build their intermediate and advanced skills! ", "title": "", "parent": "411", "creatorid": "7422b3634d4", "id": "f1eec972bb18"}
