{"content": "Loved the data visualization here\u200a\u2014\u200athanks for a great article! and Matt Canty\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve run across plenty of materials that make easy comparisons of neighborhoods in the Midwest to New York and California. For example, there\u2019s activist/artist\u2019s Nato Thompson\u2019s Seeing Power, where Thompson discusses the origin of the \u201cpeculiar fashion-conscious scenester unwilling to tie him- or herself to any single cultural movement\u201d (ahem, \u201chipster\u201d), who \u201cgravitated toward the increasingly gentrified neighborhoods of Silver Lake in Los Angeles, Wicker Park in Chicago, Williamsburg in New York, and Mission in San Francisco.\u201d Bon Appetit regularly shows Chicago and the Twin Cities some love. Elsewhere, I\u2019ve even seen Salt Lake City pop up in trendy pieces on craft brewing! Don\u2019t let confirmation bias give you the impression that the tight logic developed in this study won\u2019t be generously applied to the rest of the country (eventually).
