{"name": "1346_16", "child": "", "content": "Where I\u2019d love to see Medium\u00a0headed I\u2019m super excited to see where Medium is headed with its objective to be the publishing platform for everyone. And so I thought I\u2019d take this opportunity to also share a few of my thoughts on what I like best about Medium and where I\u2019d like to see it headed. Medium started its journey about the same time as when I started my journey in the US as a freshman at USC. I\u2019ve been a fan of its clean design and reading experience, and over the past few years\u200a\u2014\u200ahave fallen in love with the content that I find on it. What I\u00a0like\u2026 While Facebook provides me with a cluttered and false/filtered view into other peoples lives, Medium provides me with a more genuine and deeper dive into the minds of the people I follow.\u201cMarketers ruin everything\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019ve all heard that before and I love that there isn\u2019t any direct advertising on the platform. Most of the content marketing we see is actually quite interesting and sometimes good learning material too.Previously, I would almost always head straight to the \u2018Top Stories\u2019 but after I started following some more interesting and active Medium users (like Ev himself), I\u2019ve found my \u2018Home\u2019 feed to be more interesting as it shows what others have recommended. Where I\u2019d like to see Medium\u00a0headed\u2026 I\u2019ve been on the platform for a few years now but I\u2019m yet to publish my first post. I\u2019m constantly sharing my thoughts/photos on Facebook, but that\u2019s only because that\u2019s where my audience is. I read Ev describe his vision for Medium as a publishing platform for everyone, but majority of those people are people who\u2019ll be posting on Medium for the first time. Many of the most interesting posts I\u2019ve read on Medium were by people who were using the platform for the first time to announce something pretty big that happened in their lives. I wish there was a feature to discover \u201cfirst posts\u201d by Medium users. Or a way to not only find good content, but also find good content creators or recommenders. I understand that I\u2019m talking only from a writer\u2019s perspective but if it can somehow be linked into the \u2018Home\u2019 feed, the possibility of being discovered will likely be an incentive for people to start sharing their thoughts on Medium.I wish there was a nice way to \u2018invite friends\u2019 to try Medium. I love Medium and I actively recommend my friends to get on it, but that doesn\u2019t really end up happening (but please don\u2019t make it something annoying like LinkedIn\u2019s \u201cinvite your friends\u201d).I have an almost love/hate relationship with the \u2018Top Stories\u2019 section because that\u2019s usually where I find some of my favorite material but I also refresh it twice a day to check if there\u2019s anything new\u200a\u2014\u200aand most of the time, the content pretty much stays the same for about 3\u20134 days. I\u2019m not sure how the ranking works but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s based on the number of new \u2018recommends per day.\u2019 It would be awesome to see if the ranking algorithm could be improved by including metrics like how many people finished reading it (registered users + non-registered), how many non-registered users clicked \u201crecommend\u201d but then didn\u2019t log in/sign up and other metrics that might give an indication to the quality.Let\u2019s not get carried away trying to add more features, but I\u2019d love to be able to browse through my \u2018Bookmarks\u2019 page and see my highlights pull-up beside the article preview and also a way for me to write private notes beside the bookmark (inspired by my favorite feature on the kindle). Something like\u00a0this\u2026 Medium, to me, seems like the only platform out there right now which is focused on quality of content and provides promise of reach. While I may cross-post whatever I end up writing on Medium to Facebook notes also, I\u2019d rather not have to do that. p.s. stoked to meet Ev Williams at the Kairos Global Summit next month!
