When you write your basic component building blocks as nothing more than dumb components that take in props and render something, you get a huge advantage in being able to reuse those components throughout your app and avoid duplication of functionality. Keeping the data concerns away from the dumb components and into the smart components replicates the conventional controller\u200a\u2014\u200aview relationship, which is still my preferred way to structure apps.
