The stuff I\u2019m dragging around in a knapsack on my back is big, big stuff. I find myself struggling to catch my breath as I search many times throughout the day. I search to find the confidence I need to know I\u2019m doing good things in the world. Next time I\u2019m looking, I\u2019ll start my search here. That way it won\u2019t take so long to find and I\u2019ll be able to breathe without gasping. You can\u2019t possibly know. I needed to read that I am a helper. Right now I\u2019m trying to help stuff that seems unhelpable. But, then again, maybe the stuff is more helpable than I thought. I\u2019d have never guessed that if it weren\u2019t for you. So we\u2019re square, you and me. \ud83d\ude0e Thank you for telling me, Paul Reney.
