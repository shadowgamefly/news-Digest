We still have a very good relationship despite our differences. I\u2019m luckily that my parents raised me to be not only to be intellectually curious, but to be kind and understanding as well. I will always be grateful to them for this, and for deciding to not make our relationship difficult.", "title": "", "parent": "1215", "creatorid": "d8c8f1291cad", "id": "515a779289e6"}
