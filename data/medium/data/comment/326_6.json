{"name": "326_6", "child": "", "content": "Awesome post! I believe this is a direct parallel to smart \u2018product strategy and thinking\u2019 as well\u2026.simply releasing a lot of features and updates might be \u2018efficient\u2019 and feel like \u2018movement\u2019, but it\u2019s also a vanity metric. Your post applies this logic to the entire company, which I completely agree with. \u2018Your product isn\u2019t the product, the company that creates the product is the product\u2019! I\u2019ve also observed that not only is \u2018doing the right things\u2019 the key, but \u2018doing the right things, right\u2019 matters. It lays the foundation on which the future is built, so must be at least somewhat stable. Metrics infrastructure and culture, operations of various functions, etc etc\u2026.these can come back to haunt you\u2026.
