{"name": "1668_12", "child": "", "content": "Awesome post. If you want to do a follow-up, along the lines of your suggested further improvements, you could implement negamax instead of minimax. You could also write about implementing transposition tables to make the algorithm faster. It\u2019s a relatively easy add-on with a potentially big pay off in speed. Building on that, you could also show us how to implement a simple Monte Carlo Tree Search. Would love to read about. Keep up the good work, enjoyed reading ya.
