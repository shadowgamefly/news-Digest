{"name": "864_1", "child": "", "content": "The recent purchase of Nina Simone\u2019s childhood home in Tryon, NC is a very different case, practically speaking, but it should be noted that her family was also left out of the loop. I\u2019m personally involved in helping to correct that error. Other differences, like value, condition, and the need for international agreements make yours much more complex. It seems obvious to me that your family should be included, as consultants, investors, or whatever role(s) you choose, and that consideration should have been made at the start. I truly hope that you\u2019re able to stall and eventually prevent the destruction of your sacred place. I would love to visit it one day.
