I want to be brave enough to allow myself, my preferences, my moods to change every sing day, not inhibited by who I \u201cthink\u201d I am. The snippet above reminds me of this famous quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson: \u201c A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.

Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.\u201d ", "name": "2208_5", "id": "6f507433c953"}
