{"name": "712_12", "child": "", "content": "You will NEVER, EVER convince an engineer that hiring a designer is better than empowering themselves by using Material Design. I have been told multiple times since MD\u2019s availability that certain scale projects are simply not worth the cost of an actual designer over an already finished template. While we know the parallel to the statement \u201cWhy hire a designer when I can just use Material Design\u201d is \u201cWhy hire an architect when I can just use Modern Architecture,\u201d just like any other template, framework or standardization the entire purpose is to allow people to follow those guidelines and end up with completely usable solutions. Especially when front end web design (not development) is really creating a aesthetic around responsive layouts that are all more or less the same. Design is a boutique or upscale solution that is simply not cost efficient, again, depending on the project. Someone who isn\u2019t an engineer will empower themselves by using templated site-builders. Someone who is will empower themselves by using design frameworks and guidelines. Only someone needing a \u201ccustom experience\u201d will bother with design. An apt analogy is getting a tailored suit versus a suit that roughly fits your measurements. Of course tailored is better, but to many people the pricepoint isn\u2019t worth it. ", "title": "", "parent": "712", "creatorid": "8f71cf4a149", "id": "2a7dcbaedd21"}
