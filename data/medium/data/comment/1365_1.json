It\u2019s because people can\u2019t opt out of voting for a woman unless they like the label of misogynists.

It\u2019s because people are tired of social justice groups like BLM and feminism who successfully weave narratives that actively harm the demographic they pretend to give a damn about. The list goes on, of course. Trump could have promised the people he\u2019ll build a tower that shoots lasers and sends subliminal messages to the minds of citizens\u200a\u2014\u200aand people would have voted for him still. Not because they believe in his ideas, but because they can\u2019t stand you. I doubt you\u2019ll get the idea, of course, as you\u2019re too busy finding new dragons to slay\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cfake news\u201d is an old concept that was followed by \u201cTHE RUSSIANS ARE COMMING!!!!1!\u201d and were still seeing new conspiracy theories popping up.
