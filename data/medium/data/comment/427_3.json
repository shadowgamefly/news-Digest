{"name": "427_3", "child": "", "content": "Awesome article Alexis! Adria was brave, doing what she thought was right. It can be tough though, finding the right volume at which to speak. I doubt the loss of jobs were her intention at the time (certainly not her own). I think this brings up a very good point, \u201chow to speak up\u201d is a topic not covered by many. I\u2019m not saying she needs a \u201cformula\u201d for doing what she did but in a \u201cbetter way,\u201d rather an examination of the current environment, the legal obligations of companies and their responses to public harassment and public actions by their employees. I think companies are not prepared for the modern complexities of public exposure (which seems shocking considering how far we are into this). Are there any companies that are doing this well or any organizations or think-tanks who have come together to think this through\u2026or are companies just \u201ctweaking\u201d the language of outdated communications policies? I am out spoken, I have chosen to quit my full time job in order to do so. What organizations and guidance exist so that others can speak their mind without having to make that choice?
