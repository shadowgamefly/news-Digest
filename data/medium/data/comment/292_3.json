{"name": "292_3", "child": "", "content": "Regarding Mr. Kirsch\u2019s comment, yes, agencies have long tapped into freelancers. That \u201cexternal talent strategy\u201d is a bit more like a \u201ccontingent\u201d work force and typically brings the talent in to the shop to work alongside staff creatives. It is a useful way to test talent, meet short-term or specific needs, and may satisfy some accounting or HR strategies. Crowdsourcing does indeed \u201cwork\u201d differently. The talent remains outside the shop, its output can be turned over to agency CDs who manage how/what moves forward, and it can either be a virtual team or it can be an ever changing and diverse pool of thinkers.The ideas generated in a crowd or network can serve as stimulation or as a way to address \u201cFOMO;\u201d a \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d approach.The crowdsourcing model can offer up a population that is a notch above user-generated to highly specialized and vetted members. Boom Ideanet, which Mr. Yakob mentions, fits on the vetted end of the spectrum and stives to give agencies and brands an advantage without taking advantage of the creatives, seeking a balance between competition and compensation. Some of the models on the other end can be exploitative, churn models. You are likely to see more crowd-based businesses in the future. Only time will tell if they\u00a0\u2026 work.
