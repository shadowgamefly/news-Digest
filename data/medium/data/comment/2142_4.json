You are correct, no one can cure us, but support is vital. You made some great points about exercise, meditation etc\u2026 those are proven methods that help with the healing process! First and foremost, the person must seek help if it\u2019s become part of their life and it\u2019s taken over their life. They may need medication to get through the counseling and other aspects of the illness. Once some healing takes place, they can begin to seek out the activities you listed which are healthy and increase endorphins too. I began power walking again, using my elliptical and dancing! I\u2019ve also been in therapy called EMDR, I will write an article about this therapy soon. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and comment. It sounds like what you are doing sure is helping you! ", "name": "2142_4", "id": "8b90f651945d"}
