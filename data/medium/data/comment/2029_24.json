{"child": "", "title": "", "id": "f1391d47145a", "content": "It is disheartening to know that creative work is not being given the recognition it deserves. In my opinion, writers, artists, musicians, and filmmakers should be paid more then the mere business man. They bring entertainment into what would be a dull life without it. Also it\u2019s much harder to be original and creative then it is to follow the status quo. I hope that even though people can\u2019t make a full time career out of creative work that they still continue doing it if it\u2019s something they are passionate about. I also hope that in the future we can shed light onto this issue and give creative work the proper recognition it deserves. To all creative people out there, don\u2019t give up on something you love. There will always be people out there to appreciate your work. ", "creatorid": "7e577d32be1", "name": "2029_24", "parent": "2029"}
