{"content": "Awesome piece (and Hey!). My one nitpick is that it hasn\u2019t been 4 years. Mac Pro trashcan was previewed in July 2013, specs officially announced Oct 2013 and went on sale December 19th 2013. I remember because that\u2019s my birthday. So it\u2019s been 3 years and change. But you are absolutely correct that is ages ago in tech time. I\u2019m as relieved and excited about the promise of a new machine, but it\u2019s all coming way too late. I am unwilling to use Windows so I\u2019m doing the eGPU experiment with my MacBook Pro 2016, and probably buying a new 5K iMac to hold out for the new modular miracle machine. I\u2019m curious how the Surface Studio is treating you. You really animate on that thing? Its a beautiful piece of hardware but the price/performance ratio isn\u2019t much better than a Mac, if not worse. Cheers man!
