{"name": "1489_5", "child": "", "content": "Jared Kushner\u2019s Jobs- A Reflective View It is nice to know Ivanka said Don\u2019 T couldn\u2019t read or write. If the Trumptator could actually read and comprehend the very humorous and outrageous satire written about him, writers would have to circumvent his indignation, little finger pointing, public ridicule, possible deportation or the most dreaded of all consequences, being appointed to his administration! Just thinking of having Jared Kushner\u2019s position, whatever it may be at the time, for a day (not night) causes me to break out into a cold sweat, makes me see my ponytail turning orange, and induces a constant gnawing dread of being seen in public with Trumpty Dumpty. Even if Don\u2019 T offered me an extravagant salary, a huge life insurance policy (protecting me from an accidental homicide), a guarantee of never being referred to as a relative and at the end of his term including a clause that would \u201cdeny any knowledge of my actions\u201d; I would still refuse. Knowing the Trumptator cannot understand big words, complex (or even complete) sentences gives me a sense of safety and comfort. Knowing satire is well beyond his comprehension level (and everyone he knows would fear explaining it to him) provides a level of confidence and security that I will never have to face the ultimate personal humiliation - becoming a Trumpette!
