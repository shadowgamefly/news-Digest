{"name": "1147_9", "child": "", "content": "The worst I\u2019ve done on here was call someone an ignorant coward after he said that an elderly Jewish historian who specialized in Hitler\u2019s life who had his life threatened by Neo-Nazi supporters of Trump was betraying \u201chis people in Israel\u201d by not supporting Trump. That was the most insane comment I have ever heard in my entire life and I really tore into him. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, he just blocked me and didn\u2019t whine and complain to Medium authorities. I don\u2019t get why he didn\u2019t just block you. Nor do I understand why Medium staff took your \u201ctransgression\u201d so seriously, because it\u2019s nothing compared to responses that so many women receive on here on a regular basis. Weirdness abounds here, that\u2019s for sure. ", "title": "", "parent": "1147", "creatorid": "7e044b7fef1b", "id": "60f3fc4ef774"}
