I think you and your words are beautiful. I am sorry that you have found any other response. It happens. You are very wise. Be kind to yourself. Take a break. Take care of you and if you can, build a community that doesn\u2019t take shots at vulnerability because they can\u2019t handle being vulnerable themselves. Vulnerable is real and it takes work because it is scary. People who attack it are afraid. They destroy beauty. You are beautiful. Thank you for sharing you. Not just in this piece but in all your work. Being vulnerable is being strong. ", "title": "", "parent": "571", "creatorid": "c0d0bb41517e", "id": "f36ce0fb28f3"}
