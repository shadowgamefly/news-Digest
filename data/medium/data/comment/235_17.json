{"name": "235_17", "child": "", "content": "What gives me joy is joy itself, being fully awake in the present moment and feeling the deep base of happiness that underpins even the darkest moments. They always pass but the joy never does, knowing that whatever happens I have always come through and if I don\u2019t then that is the end but neither of those ever diminish this deeply magically joyful present moment. I have deep joy all the time but occasionally it gets clouded over by life challenges until i can return to joy. Joy is our natural state but we obscure it with our minds and with a deep mindfulness practice you can return to it, not by finding it by but removing that which obscures it. Fear of joy is just a different form of obscuration, just another version of fear which has us clinging onto suffering. We do this because we allow our egos to take precedence over our transcendent selves and all forms of fear are the tool of the ego to keep us in control. Once you get on top of mind /ego and allow yourself to come from heart and transcendent existence then you can only experience liberated joy which is boundless and endless and ever present and everywhere, you just need to dip into it and let go. Hope this helps. ", "title": "", "parent": "235", "creatorid": "c78d8bead359", "id": "e60b0203aa2c"}
