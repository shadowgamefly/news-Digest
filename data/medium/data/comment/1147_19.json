Excerpt\u2026 I\u2019ve been told by Medium\u2019s \u201cTrust and Safety\u201d officer (sounds like something out of 1984) that I\u2019m \u201cabusing the system\u201d by blocking annoying and unpleasant people, and that I should read the rules, even though he acknowledges that there\u2019s no rule against blocking people\u00a0\u2026 it would be bizarre to have both a blocking feature and a rule against using it. Apparently my transgression is to respond to the annoying or unpleasant comment before blocking the person. That\u2019s what they call \u201cabuse\u201d. But how do they even become aware of this? Well, because the annoying and unpleasant people send complaints to Medium that I\u2019m not allowing them to further be annoying and unpleasant toward me. But surely it is annoying the Medium staff with such complaints that is abusive. The notion that annoying and unpleasant people are entitled to get in one last jab before they are blocked is ludicrous.
