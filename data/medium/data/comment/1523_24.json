{"name": "1523_24", "child": "", "content": "Oh, and for those Sean Spicer apologists who are saying \u201cwell Hitler didn\u2019t put gas in a shell or bomb and shoot it at his own people so that means that Hitler was different (and better?). The definition of a weapon is \u201ca thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage.\u201d The means of applying that weapon is not relevant. When you use something to kill, you have used a weapon. Hitler use gas as a weapon against his own people so, technically speaking, Sean was just flat wrong. However, the worst part of this was that Sean was trying to explain how Assad was worse than Hitler. Are you kidding? If you ever find yourself trying to explain how someone is worse than Hitler, you should change the subject as quickly as possible. BTW, Assad\u2019s recent gas attack is actually not that uncommon in that part of the world. Assad did worse during Obama\u2019s first term. Hussain routinely gassed the Kurds in Iraq. Gas was used, by both sides, during the Iran/Iraq war. ", "title": "", "parent": "1523", "creatorid": "cc87fc38ba28", "id": "1cff226ae194"}
