You are spot on when you criticize the many people who did not vote. Ms. Clinton should have won this election, and was prevented from winning by a perfect storm of factors, one of which was the failure of people to actually go out and vote. I have particular contempt for the Sanders voters who refused to heed Mr. Sanders himself and refused to vote for Ms. Clinton. Their refusal to support an imperfect candidate produced a despicable President. ", "title": "", "parent": "957", "creatorid": "73500a796f4c", "id": "8149070fe5a1"}
