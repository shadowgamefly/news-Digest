Non-fiction books are full of knowledge and facts but fictions teach you something far more important and\u200avaluable\u2014\u200aempathy, new perspectives, story telling, understanding others, patience and so much more. EQ is as important as IQ, if not more. These aren\u2019t my favourite fiction books but the messages conveyed are\u00a0important. 1984 by George Orwell. It makes you realize how important, beautiful and precious Freedom is. We must protect it with all we have.Second Variety by Philip K Dick. A reminder of how dangerous our inventions, AI, Robots, War Machines can get,\u00a0if\u00a0we\u2019re\u00a0reckless.V for Vendetta\u00a0by\u00a0Alan\u00a0Moore and\u00a0David\u00a0Lloyd. A graphic novel series about the freedom of individuals from government oppression. The message is somewhat similar to that of 1984 but it\u2019s incredibly good and worth reading.Harry Potter series. Friendship, love, loyalty and bravery can be magical.
