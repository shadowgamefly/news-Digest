{"name": "344_15", "child": "", "content": "The jury is out on user-centric design moving the needle in enterprise. I personally think it\u2019s worth designing from the user\u2019s perspective simply because it makes a better product, but that\u2019s despite all demands from the buyer to add features that compete with the best user experience. A user-first design keeps an enterprise app sticky (i.e. low churn), but it can work against you in the initial sale you with a non-user buyer: \u201cyeah that\u2019s great for our users, but what are you doing for me?\u201d Example: one of the key values our calendar product provides is a massive increase in attendance to events, due in large part to having a world-class end-user experience. Really, is there any other metric one should care about? Why have a calendar at all otherwise? And yet, 99% of the buyers we talk to couldn\u2019t care less about that real-world stat. They want the ability to set granular permission levels, import events from various places, and maintain security. These requirements aren\u2019t invalid, they are just starkly different than (and sometimes in conflict with) the end-user\u2019s goals.
