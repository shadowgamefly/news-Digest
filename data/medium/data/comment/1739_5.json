{"name": "1739_5", "child": "", "content": "I have tried many apps for meditation but have not found them to be particularly effective. Having said that, I am glad to see so many people are exploring and taking up mindfulness meditation. The Headspace example proves there is widespread interest. I am sure more people will really work with mindfulness as the market matures. It takes practice but it is well worth the small effort involved. After 40 years of meditating and 30 years of teaching all my psychotherapy clients meditation and many years of being involved in meditation research I have seen a great many programs come and go. The ones that most people end up using are the ones that really work. I always recommend to my clients and students that they work with a guided meditation program, especially when they first get started. The ones I suggest to everyone are the downloadable audio programs at www.lightunlimitedpublishing.com. These have been on the market and very popular for over 30 years for many good reasons. No matter what method one chooses for mindfulness and meditation it takes consistent practice for it to become effective. It is worth the small effort involved.
