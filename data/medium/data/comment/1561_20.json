{"name": "1561_20", "child": "", "content": "Skipping past the argle bargle in the article: The Founders conceived of the United States as a union of states, not a democracy. The ONLY democratic institution in the Constitution was the House of Representatives. And, at the time, the people eligible to vote were free white men over the age of 21 who owned substantial property. The state legislatures appointed the US Senators. The state legislatures could select Presidential electors in any manner they chose (which is still the case.) The Republic has been democratized by the direct election of Senators (17th Amendment) and the custom\u200a\u2014\u200anot law\u200a\u2014\u200aof having a popular vote of the President. Also, property requirements for voting have been removed, racial restrictions on voting have been removed, and women have been allowed to vote. Over time, the Republic has worked pretty well, with only the big breakdown in the 1860s marring its record. Would it work better without the Senate? I doubt it. Sooner or later, residents of the majority of states would get tired of being outvoted by California and New York. But more immediately, the Senate is contestable for Democrats. The House, not so much. As for the Supreme Court: There is no filibuster in the House. Gorsuch would already be in office if the House decided it.
