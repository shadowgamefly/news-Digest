Do you know that we have an Electoral College? (Yes, that is the same Electoral College that Bill Clinton and Obama and others won.) You say the popular majority vote is good, but then you say the filibuster is a good tool of the minority power. The Senate was designed to give hope to the small population states. The idea is that we have 50 states, and a state is equal to other states. The degrading of the filibuster was done by Harry Reid, (D). It was good for him, but now it is not good for those in power? Also, remember it was the Dems who were the anti-Civil Rights crowd, lead by KKK leader Robert Byrd. I think you missed out on what is the focus of name of this country. The United STATES of America. That is why the senate represent states. The COUNTRY is composed of STATES. It is not one state, but 50 states. That is why the laws can be different in various states. You can smoke pot in some, not others. Some states pay no state tax and other like CA pay ridiculous amounts. States have rights. That is why we are the United States. There are many other countries you can move to if you find the USA unlivable. But, most people vote with their feet to come to living in United STATES of America.
