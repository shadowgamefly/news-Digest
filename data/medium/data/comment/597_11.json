{"name": "597_11", "child": "", "content": "\u201cBumble\u2019s landmark feature is that women must take the initiative on all conversations.\u201d I\u2019m a huge fan of Bumble. And will continue to use it until I find some success. One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that while my profile is enough to inspire plenty of matches, so many of those matches expire before a conversation ever begins. I\u2019ve tried extending them, to no avail. I often wonder what it is about my profile that inspires the initial match, but not the next step. I understand and respect the decisions not to initiate conversations, but I\u2019m curious if any of the women using the app find themselves allowing matches to expire more frequently than not. When you match, do you always make contact? Or is this more common? It\u2019s still the best app that I\u2019ve seen. As a man who is out there trying to meet women, my greatest concern is not making someone feel preyed upon. Because there\u2019s plenty of that going around. So I\u2019m all in on Bumble. Perhaps as the app becomes more ubiquitous, the general comfort level will rise and a match will more readily create a conversation. Until then, I\u2019ll keep swiping and hoping.
