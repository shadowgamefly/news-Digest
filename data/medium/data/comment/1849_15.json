{"name": "1849_15", "child": "", "content": "Loving read and waxing overly passionately about the physicality of the book are, of course, two different things. I do love to read. It\u2019s my profession. The truth is, fewer than 25% of the population (and I think it is much lower than that) read a book in the last 12 months. A book. On anything. (Not just a novel\u200a\u2014\u200ahey, there are lots of folks that don\u2019t do novels, and I like some nonfiction myself, so I get that.) I do disagree that \u201creading\u201d isn\u2019t a moral good. Maybe in an absolute sense it is value neutral, but literacy is necessary to survive. All kinds of literacy, but certainly the basic ability to read. Being a good citizen means at least trying to be informed about things. If one is not informed, if one is wrongly informed, then one may well be doing more damage that not. So I do think reading is a moral good. Or at least a civic good. On the other hand, people who wax poetic about books and paper and how great ludditeness is, yeah, that\u2019s annoying. I do love old books, but hey, I\u2019m a medievalist, so I think manuscripts are awesome! But I also don\u2019t wax poetic about them. (Except when I\u2019m talking to my classes, but that doesn\u2019t count.) I couldn\u2019t, today, deal with someone who wasn\u2019t engaged at all in the world. And you can\u2019t be engaged\u200a\u2014\u200areally engaged\u200a\u2014\u200aif you don\u2019t read at all. ", "title": "", "parent": "1849", "creatorid": "b8a27bdc9002", "id": "6e6b4527b9"}
