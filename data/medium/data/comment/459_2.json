{"name": "459_2", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for your response! About the description, you mean \u201cThe fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client for every server or UI framework\u201d one? Well, honestly I find it very informative and well thought. I wouldn\u2019t change it. Mentioning cache in the description sometimes sound as a side-feature pointing out, but knowing what it actually does, cache is indeed in the heart of the tool and it\u2019s worth mentioning. I guess you should try asking people that do not know Apollo (but work with GraphQL) what they understand of it, if they understand what it could be used for.
