The word \u201cbaguette\u201d roughly translates as \u201cwand,\u201d \u201crod\u201d or \u201cstick.\u201d This the traditional French baguette tends to be more narrow than the one in the photo. The French bread in the photo would more likely just be called pain, which roughly translates \u201cbread\u201d or \u201cloaf,\u201d and which I\u2019m guessing American grocers are reluctant to call it for obvious reasons. I\u2019m not saying nobody calls the bread in the photo a baguette (maybe even in France!), I\u2019m just saying that it technically ain\u2019t one. Here\u2019s a picture of what I would call baguettes, for reference: Source: http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/22781/index1.html The photo difference is not so great, but the bite difference is tremendous. Sorry for the explainer. Dammit, now I\u2019m hungry. Again. ", "name": "2260_10", "id": "9520a1f97527"}
