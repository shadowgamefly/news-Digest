{"name": "394_7", "child": "", "content": "I thought homeschooling was a bad idea; this is even worse. The only reason to skip college is to avoid the backbreaking expenses and lifetime loans. To suggest that one doesn\u2019t actually learn anything in college is simply ridiculous. What makes you think creativity, networking, self-reinvention\u200a\u2014\u200ato name a few of your own \u201cclasses\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aaren\u2019t fostered in college? Many people make future business partners and longterm connections with others they met and found common ground with in college. While we\u2019re talking about networking, you do realize that Facebook started as a means for college students to stay connected, right? College campuses tend to be breeding grounds (to follow your \u201cidea sex\u201d point) for transformative ideas. And how can you decide to master a field without knowing what else exists out there? Taking different courses can be a great way to introduce yourself to discover which concepts \u201cset a fire in your heart\u201d or whatever. If your motives are purely to cut costs on your children\u2019s education, you are completely justified, but you must own that. Don\u2019t blow off a whole institution while offering paltry alternatives. Your daughter is right to take her time to think about your offer. I suspect from reading your proposed course outline that what you\u2019re actually trying to achieve is more control over her education. (For example: \u201cWatch a movie every day and discuss\u201d it with you? Really? Why shouldn\u2019t she be able to go do the same thing with people her own age, as college students are wont to do?) She probably doesn\u2019t need you to decide what\u2019s best for her, education-wise, anymore. ", "title": "", "parent": "394", "creatorid": "5b0a16a2af94", "id": "3a17e3d82de5"}
