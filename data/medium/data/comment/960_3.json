{"name": "960_3", "child": "", "content": "Let\u2019s not forget that in religion, as in politics, people do not always fully believe either in what they tell others, or even in what they tell themselves. Remember the \u2018sick soul\u2019 and \u2018healthy soul\u2019 (something along those lines) in William James: \u2018The Varieties of Religious Experience.\u2019 A certain kind of conscience is torn and racked and riven by doubts; this can lead to dangerous behavior. Again, in his book \u2018Violence,\u2019 Slavoj Zizek states that SOME fundamentalists are dangerous precisely because they are doubting souls. Just look at jihadists, for example. But this is also true of people who are not violent; or even, in many cases, not even wicked. (To anyone reading who objects to the foregoing: I make no apologies for using words like \u2018wicked\u2019 or \u2018good.\u2019 It may not be very postmodernly-correct, but that\u2019s how I roll).
