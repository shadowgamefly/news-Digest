It is the left who caused the division in our nation by destroying every thing in the traditional values that built and maintained our nation and it\u2019s ways of life. those traditions made this nation the single most powerful and advanced on Earth and with the most freedom. the left regularly attacks that freedom with laws and regulations in an attempt to control us to a degree I find frightening and totally unnecessary,one that stifles advancement and individuality destroys personal success and causes the young these days to act in very ant like concert when they protest individuality.
