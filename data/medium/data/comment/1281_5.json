She went straight to her crate every night without any prompting. The first thing I did every morning was let her out and give her a treat so in my mind that is what I was doing. She went out to do her business but was always right next to me otherwise. I didn\u2019t follow up on that in the story, but I promise you she wasn\u2019t forgotten outside. She wouldn\u2019t have stood for it!\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "1281", "creatorid": "af6d65be46f9", "id": "15bf2feb5280"}
