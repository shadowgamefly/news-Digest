{"id": "a18f66cf4792", "content": "Hey! Thanks for your response\u00a0:) Great point re: Salesforce. Adoption is critical. 100% agree that every last little bit of manually collected sales data needs to be captured in Salesforce or you\u2019re going to miss critical insights. The only thing I\u2019d say is that sometimes folks sync too much data to Salesforce just so that reps can see it in their views. This is data from other systems that is only being pushed to Salesforce as a copy. What we sometimes help folks do instead is to embed Looker or Mode reports in their Salesforce views as a better way to show, for example, trial usage data for a lead. This is better than attempting to sync all of that raw data over to Salesforce simply because heavyweight syncing processes like that tend to create a lot of tech debt over time, and relying on your BI infrastructure to deliver, well, BI, just makes sense\u00a0:) Thanks again\u200a\u2014\u200agreat points.
