{"name": "24_15", "child": "", "content": "HardenLeonardWestbrook With an average team, great talent, and a refusal to share the ball, it\u2019s not surprising that Westbrook averaged a triple-double. Impressive, but not surprising. Harden and Lebron could\u2019ve done it too if they had tried. Westbrook, despite his assist total, didn\u2019t make his team better. I don\u2019t mean wins. I mean, despite making the playoffs, does anyone see OKC winning anything? Houston could possibly win the West. That\u2019s not because Harden could get triple doubles and is a great player, but because he made the rest of his team better. In a new system, with a new coach, Harden changed AND improved his game to make his team a contender. That\u2019s more impressive.
