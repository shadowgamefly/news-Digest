Is there any kind of \u201cfollow-up\u201d to OKRs, that ensures 100% is eventually reached? Should the OKR carry over to the next quarter with a goal of completing it to 100%, or does it just drop out of the goals once you hit that sweet spot, you set new OKRs and the other 20\u201330% gets completed \u201cwhenever\u201d?", "name": "2387_9"}
