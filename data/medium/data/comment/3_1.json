I\u2019ve always felt that Google Books could have been something much greater, and I do wonder if some compromise between Google and the Authors\u2019 Guild could have led to better outcomes for all concerned. In 2013 I wrote a dissertation on possible legal solutions to the orphan works issue. It briefly discusses Google Books, as well as meme culture and a number of ongoing efforts to address the orphan works problem. Sadly, nothing much seems to have happened in the field since 2013. However, your piece spurred me to publish the dissertation online, so it\u2019s now available here under a Creative Commons licence: http://simoncollinson.com/for-great-justice/ "}
