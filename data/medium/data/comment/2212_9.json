I totally agree that suffering can help us be better people if we deal with it in the right way. It\u2019s a mystery (one of the biggest of life). On the one hand, all the natural disasters, sicknesses, wars, poverty, and interior traumas, etc. appall us. How can we even believe in a good world, in a providential God, in a better future, when so much pain surrounds us? But at the same time, when times of crises strike, often the beauty and goodness of the human heart arises. People\u2019s lives are changed. Countless relief efforts are launched. The idea that we\u2019re all human comes out and often shines in the midst of the darkness, and we see it over and over again. And we can emerge from them much stronger than before. Thanks again!
