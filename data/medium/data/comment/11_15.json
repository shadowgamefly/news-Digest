{"name": "11_15", "child": "", "content": "Finding this artical on Medium today was a beautifully serendipitous moment for me. I was in tears this morning, completely at adrift and unsure about what I\u2019m trying to acheive in life. I\u2019m constantly striving to do new things, seek new oppurtunities and further myself. Sometimes I feel so scared to speak out, worried whether I\u2019m acting from a place of truth, enlightenment, honesty, resentment or anger. Worried whether people will agree or disagree, whether my current path will allow me to diverge and take a new direction. None of that matters, because it\u2019s fine to share feelings, as long as they doesn\u2019t judge or blame others, then why not? Equally, if other people have feelings about what I do, that\u2019s fine, they should share that too. And any direction I take is the right one, as long as it\u2019s for me, not for anyone else. Time to go and ruffle some feathers\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "11", "creatorid": "25a82719f511", "id": "9e3f7e412500"}
