Silicon Valley needs to spread these stories and actively scout for talent in developing countries\u200a\u2014\u200afor selfish reasons. Otherwise they will miss out on the best talent and ideas. I have seen ingenious founders from all over the world suffer from inferiority complex, thinking they won\u2019t ever qualify for programs like YC. They disqualify themselves before they even applied. The same thing happens with Ivy League Schools, scholarships and grants\u00a0\u2026. most people (especially women, people from minority groups, developing countries etc.) don\u2019t get turnt down. They never even applied. ", "title": "", "parent": "426", "creatorid": "6dbd9f74b566", "id": "d9a93d5fbc37"}
