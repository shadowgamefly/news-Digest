Some people have stronger personalities and bosses don\u2019t want those people on their teams. I\u2019m white and I KNOW I have not gotten jobs because I have a strong personality. Heck, I\u2019m pretty certain that I never get asked out because of this, and my personality isn\u2019t THAT strong. I\u2019m just bold, passionate and have opinions which I usually keep to myself. You also talked specifically about your anger at getting passed when you were the most qualified for the job. Welcome to the real world. This happens ALL the time in GOVERNMENT jobs. I applied for MANY jobs where I was perfectly qualified, happy and always smiling in the interview, had great recommendations and then I see or hear from others who they hire and I\u2019m shocked. This is just personal bias, not racial. Maybe even the person had an in and was someone\u2019s family member or close friend. I\u2019m in an arts related field and one of the biggest things they say in this industry is it\u2019s not about your skill level but \u201cAre you the best fit for the team?\u201d People need to be able to work together and if a supervisor doesn\u2019t think someone will be the best fit, it doesn\u2019t matter what reviews, recommendations or skill levels are. I suspect that once you began hearing things then you started seeing racism and mistreatment everywhere. This happens to all of us. Someone points something out and all of a sudden IT\u2019S EVERYWHERE. And it doesn\u2019t mean that there wasn\u2019t some racism, I just find that when people, including myself, start to look for something, we find it in spades. The bottom line is, give people the benefit of the doubt. Don\u2019t start judging everyone in the same corner. And always remember, people have their reasons for doing what they do and saying what they say. We all have experienced different things in our lives, raised by different parents with different rules under different roofs in different countries or states with different amounts of love and abuse and access to money and God. No, it doesn\u2019t make mistreatment right, but it should hopefully help you take a step back and put things into perspective. And when you do come upon someone that is racist, prove them wrong by showing them that you are not the stereotype they have created in their head. Good luck.
