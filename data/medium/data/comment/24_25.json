When the chances don\u2019t seem good with the person you most want, you settle for someone else; someone \u201cless\u201d in your judgement. Or am I interpreting that too harshly? That is precisely why you would have encountered many more of the kind of men you did not want when you were not at your best. They were doing precisely what you appear to be doing, for the same reason. It\u2019s also why you deter those people when you are at your best, because they reckon they have no chance. It\u2019s not because you were \u201chotter\u201d, but the converse. It\u2019s risky reading political causality into everyday behaviour.
