I haven\u2019t seen many designers/developers use this trick yet. It\u2019s most oftenly found in games. But the trick is simple, you just make different animations by tweaking a base animation slightly. As an example used in game design, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Majora\u2019s Mask, have three different jumping animations which feels good even when you have jumped 394 times in a row. https://youtu.be/6ugt6yyJ7DA ", "title": "", "parent": "714", "creatorid": "5041b174d350", "id": "bf69b54f9e6f"}
