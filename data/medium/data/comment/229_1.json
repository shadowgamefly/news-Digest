{"name": "229_1", "child": "", "content": "True dat. Our definition of what love is comes from the belief that everyone but ourselves are supposed to give us our emotional\u00a0needs\u00a0sustainably. And while it makes sense as to why we believe that (we weren\u2019t able to take care of ourselves when we were babies and children, so we automatically place that responsibility on our parents), it\u2019s false. It\u2019s not the reality. If everyone but ourselves are supposed to give us our emotional\u00a0needs\u00a0sustainably, everyone would be doing that, no exceptions. The fact that that\u2019s not true means it\u2019s false. We work best when we feel loved and lovable. Both are best done by loving ourselves first and foremost. Once we\u2019ve given ourselves unconditional\u00a0love\u00a0sustainably, only then can we give others unconditional love sustainably. But learning how to love ourselves unconditionally comes outta what\u2019s true, not what\u2019s right. ", "title": "", "parent": "229", "creatorid": "d65da53856f0", "id": "b94257b1962c"}
