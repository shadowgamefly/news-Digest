The Gorsuch Family is quite patriotic and it\u2019s roots date back to the Revolution. The Gorsuch\u2019s had a farm in Maryland. Some of the Revolution was fought in their front yard. Edward Gorsuch isn\u2019t famous for the Revolutionary war though but he is famous for being murdered. Edward and his sons obtained a valid warrant and sought the return of their slave property in Pennsylvania. The confrontation occurred and after an exchange of words several were shot and Edward Gorsuch lay dead. The date was September 11, 1851, and the event came to be known famously as at \u201cChristiana\u2019s Riot\u201d. Many say it sparked the Civil War. Edwards youngest son Tommy Gorsuch was not present because he was in school with his friend and class mate John Wilkes Booth at the Milton Academy in Sparks, Maryland. The same person who was accused of Assassination of President Lincoln. General Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865. Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, Traveller. On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. In December 1860, Booth had drafted a speech which he planned to deliver in Philadelphia. Whether he delivered the speech is unknown as it was discovered by his brother, Edwin, in a trunk of John Wilkes Booth\u2019s belongings.
