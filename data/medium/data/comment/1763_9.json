{"name": "1763_9", "child": "", "content": "Oh, yeah, Medium absolutely has an agenda. If you simply look through their categories, they lean very heavily towards identity politics of all sorts, and in particular, towards certain perspectives on those issues. I mean, BlackLivesMatter is its own category, and there are many more where that came from but hardly any right-of-center equivalents, and yes, it\u2019s EXCEEDINGLY rare that I\u2019ll get any recommendations that could be described as \u201cconservative\u201d in their outlook even though I have read and recommended many articles from all points on the political spectrum. I\u2019ve noticed the same disturbing trend among the Medium Staff recommendations, which are almost exclusively from one political perspective. I wouldn\u2019t mind this if Medium purported to be a publication with an editorial agenda, but it presents itself as a neutral portal for good writing, where writers can build up their audience, etc. And yet, clearly, they give a megaphone only to certain kinds of writers. To answer your question, I\u2019d doubt that any of what I\u2019ve written has EVER been recommended by them\u00a0to\u00a0anyone, because, if it had\u00a0been, the \u201cviews\u201d would instantly have gone into the many thousands in a single day, and I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve had many more followers, etc., not because of any inherent quality of what I\u2019ve written or lack thereof, but rather, simply due to exposure. Having said all of that, the way they allow the \u201cBlock\u201d function to be used is potentially damaging to writers from all political perspectives, so I\u2019d think they\u2019d want to fix that.
