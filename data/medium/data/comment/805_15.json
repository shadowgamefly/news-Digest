{"name": "805_15", "child": "", "content": "Well, going back to the specific points you called out in the article (I had to go back and see exactly what they were): \u201cJust collect emails!\u201d In and of itself, there is not really a strategy there. So yes, this would be pretty useless advice if it didn\u2019t state anything more. However, I\u2019ve built a sizable email list, and have made a decent (albeit not 7-figures) living because of it.\u201cJust build an audience!\u201d Again, in and of itself that means nothing and teaches nothing. But I\u2019ve built a sizable audience from nothing, launched a SaaS business that related to that audience and the business has done phenomenally well, experiencing month-over-month growth for over 2 years because of it.\u201cJust do integration marketing!\u201d Honestly, I have no idea what that is\u200a\u2014\u200anever heard of it before.\u201cJust make your product epic!\u201d Yes, the Field of Dreams is a lie. You can\u2019t just build it and \u201cthey will come\u201d. I get that. I don\u2019t think anyone sincerely believes that all you have to do is build something and let it sit there without doing any work to market, promote or otherwise draw attention to it. So my real problem with this is you\u2019ve painted this polarized, sleazy caricature of those who are teaching honest marketing principles that have, in fact, worked and making a blanket judgement about them like they\u2019re all some sort of snake oil salesmen. If you have specific examples, give them. If you\u2019ve not tried any of that kind of advice and paved your own way, good for you\u200a\u2014\u200asay that. If you have tried taking this advice, talk specifically about it and say why it failed. Don\u2019t paint everyone teaching online with this gross caricature you\u2019ve created. Especially considering the product you\u2019ve built is something the legitimate ones would have been highly interested in if they weren\u2019t otherwise insulted by your generalizations. I mean, you\u2019re free to do so if it makes you feel good. But it\u2019s not going to make your business any more successful pissing off marketers.
