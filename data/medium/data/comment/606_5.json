{"name": "606_5", "child": "", "content": "Great story Maxime. A lot of powerful lessons here, and I wish you luck on your indie endeavors. I think the best part of this piece is that your argument about team size is applicable to any industry. I work in advertising and have spent time at several companies\u200a\u2014\u200aone with 30 people, a large 400 person company, and then back to one with about 30 employees. I find that I\u2019ve really appreciated working at the smaller companies because everyone has more ownership, and decisions made by the higher-ups are much more transparent. People seem to respect one another more because they know each other on a more personal level. You get to work on a diversity of projects with a diversity of skill sets and don\u2019t have to specialize as much. I think it\u2019s personal preference\u200a\u2014\u200asome people like doing one thing really well. But for others, like you and me, who get bored easily just doing the one thing, smaller seems to better. Best of luck!\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "606", "creatorid": "5a53b769e17f", "id": "2c910ea5439a"}
