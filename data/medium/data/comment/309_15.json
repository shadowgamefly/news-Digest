{"name": "309_15", "child": "", "content": "I would add that if you decide to have kids, be prepared to question everything you think you know. Most parents divide their life timelines into \u201cBefore Kids\u201d and \u201cAfter Kids,\u201d and it has nothing to do with your age or previous life experience. A person might reasonably have acquired the wisdom to be a personally fulfilled and productive member of society. But once you embark on raising another entire human being, who has his or has her own ideas about personal fulfillment and social contributions, your previous pillars of wisdom become orders of magnitude more complicated. Your old wisdom is quickly dwarfed, and (if you are the type who reflects on these things and rises to the challenge) you grow into a vastly wiser person. I have heard that it happens again when you become a grandparent, but I have no experience with this. ", "title": "", "parent": "309", "creatorid": "e672eb7b8c0", "id": "cce5117d640c"}
