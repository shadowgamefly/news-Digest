The Founders were very leery of a president morphing into a king and specifically limited the power of the office. Over the years, particularly under Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, and LBJ\u200a\u2014\u200aand due in large part to the Left\u2019s Constitution-is-a-living-document bullshit\u200a\u2014\u200athe powers of the presidency grew hugely. It\u2019s worked out well for the Left (with the exception of the Bush years). Liberals\u200a\u2014\u200abeing the children they are\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t seem capable of seeing beyond the current crisis so they welcomed a president who could unilaterally make things happen. By selecting a disaster of a candidate and then not voting for her, you\u2019ve not only put (what you consider) a \u201cmadman\u201d at the wheel, but by increasing his power, you\u2019ve also given him the keys and a full tank of gas.
