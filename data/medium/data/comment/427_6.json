{"name": "427_6", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m a 50+ year old veteran/doctor who experienced harassment and sexism (and know there was much worse for some women) in the US Army of the 80s-90s. My daughter is an engineer at NASA flourishing and apparently not running into anything like that (I keep worrying any kind mentor might just be creeping on her). FOund the tech/ women in tech articles via medium and have been fascinated by them. I am hopeful that the private sector might someday soon now catch up with the government sector. Sadly I can not yet say that the US military is on a par with NASA as reported by my daughter. Anyway thanks for this and other articles and if anyone has dirt on NASA as well please share it!
