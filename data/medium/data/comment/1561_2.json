End most closed-door exec sessions of Congress and Committees.Provide more avenues for the public to directly argue issues in Congress. Groups of citizens including experts should not be lesser voices compared to K-street lobbyists. In a better system, the different arguments and facts would be made publicly available and open to public criticism/debate prior to Congressional voting.The US Security State now takes up more than 60% of the annual discretionary budget\u200a\u2014\u200athat figure is too large to begin with, it is absurd that the Pentagon has not been audited in 2 decades, and it is absurd that so much of this activity is kept secret from the public while whistleblowers in the public interest are thrown in jail for their efforts.
