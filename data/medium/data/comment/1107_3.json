It sounds more like a couple cool kids in middle school riffing on the class\u00a0dork. (Haw. Haw. Nudge. Nudge.) I\u2019m not even sure what the premise of the book is, since I had to piece it together from mostly random quips. I gather the author of the book thinks Christians should withdraw from society. Does he give any reasoning? Scriptural backing? Historic precidents? I mean it\u2019s a whole book. There must be something in it. How does he deal with scripture like 1 Corinthians 5:9\u201310\u00a0? I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people\u2014\u00a0not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. I don\u2019t always agree with Zack Ford\u2019s articles, but I\u2019ve always found them well reasoned and insightful. Until this. I don\u2019t know what you guys learned from the last election, but making fun of deplorables isn\u2019t a winning strategy anymore.
