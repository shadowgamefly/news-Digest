Forgive me for not sharing with you the Truth that has saved me, and made me whole. You no longer have to bleed out, you no longer have to cry out. Forgive me for not telling you how precious you are to me, how wonderful you are to us, how beautiful you are to the Divine. You call it Universe, I call Him God. Forgive me for not telling you how destroyed not having my father left me, and how my faith has made me whole. Forgive me for not telling you about the spirit who guides me everyday, and helps me go through life. You are forgiven. For all your sins. You are great, and the light of the world. Your story may not fit in society\u2019s box, but it surely is needed to serve others. I love you. I need you. Your father\u2019s absence is probably what has made you extraordinary. I have read your story, I\u2019ve heard your voice. Like always I will respond for my soul is crying with you. You are now forgiven, you can therefore move on. May the divine light shine upon your face. May joy be spoken. Let love be in your life. Forgive me sister, for not telling you that the past is what has made YOU. That man has lost everything. You have nothing to mourn.  Image by Shari M ", "title": "", "parent": "535", "creatorid": "83ee89e71ac4", "id": "1d72d629f8a0"}
