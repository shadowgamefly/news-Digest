For all its destructive power, the MOAB is a conventional explosive bomb. It\u2019s neither a nuclear device nor is it a chemical or biological weapon. In a war the president\u2019s job as commander-in-chief is to outline the military\u2019s overall goal and approve or disapprove the rules of engagement. It is not to specify what or how many conventional weapons may be employed. That\u2019s the job of the professional military.
