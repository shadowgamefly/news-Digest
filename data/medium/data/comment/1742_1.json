I\u2019ve lived in Los Angeles since 2007 and for the last three years my husband and I have gone back and forth to Zurich for his work. Although Zurich is a city (much smaller obviously) it\u2019s easy to be in nature. Switzerland is peaceful, safe and the food is healthier. I thought I was weird or ridiculous for wanting to badly to leave Los Angeles permanently but after reading this it all makes sense! I feel the exact same way. Having nature, walking more and it having the honking cars and smogs makes a huge difference. My anxiety and constant headaches has all but disappeared. Anyway appreciate your words!
