{"name": "920_21", "child": "", "content": "Intuitively, you should be able to solve this with some windowing. I.e., if the search bar only allowed a search window of size K, just build up the first window of size K and then slowly slide it all the way forward (deleting the first letter and working out the last one), then slide it all the way backward. The only case where this would break down is if there are repeated substrings of size \u2265 K. In a pathological case I believe this may lead to an exponential explosion, because you\u2019d have to track down all possible suffix paths. But in any real-world workloads it\u2019d work without a hitch. ", "title": "", "parent": "920", "creatorid": "8bc4e5f8b505", "id": "f554424196e6"}
