{"name": "1449_7", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019ve also read about the positive effect of smiling on mood that @RandyMudge mentions. I\u2019m reading a book Thinking, Fast and Slow and it\u2019s fascinating, and surprising, to learn how our facial expressions can affect our thinking. While I don\u2019t think for one minute that smiling can cure depression, I think it can help lift us. In those moments, we can see a light in the darkness that can be comforting and energising. I agree with Randy\u2019s suggestion of walking in nature\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s an under-used treatment for depression. I haven\u2019t tried Randy\u2019s blade of grass trick (the thought alone made me smile), but walking in nature with trees, flowers, birds and insects, can help over time. For me, there\u2019s nothing that triggers a smile more genuinely than hearing a blackbird sing\u200a\u2014\u200ano mask, just pure delight. When I hear birdsong, I feel hope. Re-connecting with nature holds the key, I think, to a more meaningful life where we aren\u2019t constantly judging ourselves against a societal yardstick where career status, financial wealth, beauty and selfie \u2018likes\u2019 seem to carry more value than what kind of a person we are.
