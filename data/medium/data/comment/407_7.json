Sadly, the whole Free Basics controversy in India was between 2 groups with deeply flawed interests. Fact that one of them has won is of little consequence. Free Basics or not, it makes very little difference for Facebook and Airtel. They tried to expand their user base with a pro-poor strategy. Chances are, even if they got the approvals from Indian Govt, the whole initiative would have failed in its execution phase. Remember Facebook, Google, Apple etc have their own junkyard of failed products. Then we saw these Tech elites. Folks from failed money sucking failed startups. Comedians suddenly donning the hat of protectors of society. People who think they are the guardians of technology, internet and who have the only power to help the poor of this country. They have access to mass and social media and hence do not hesitate to abuse that power. The casualty in this whole circus of greed and ignorance were two entities. One is the idea of free internet itself. No other company (private or public) will ever try to make access to internet super simple. There are just too many Tech elites out there to discredit such initiatives and damage those companies. Other casualty is the poor of this country. They came so close to having free access to information and yet could not quite get there. Yes, this deserves to be celebrated. The fact that a major opportunity to change the landscape of information access in this country was not only killed, but they also made sure no one else will think of such a thing for another 10 years. Lets celebrate the 1st anniversary! ", "title": "", "parent": "407", "creatorid": "aeb8f9f8dd81", "id": "416fd0335f40"}
