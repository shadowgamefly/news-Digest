I\u2019ve been re-assured by a former cardiologist- \u201cafib won\u2019t kill you, you know.\u201d To which I needed to keep an iron tight grip on my husband\u2019s wrist so he wouldn\u2019t choke the man with the amazing bedside manner. Once I dismissed one of my former students when he was about to attach all the EKG electrodes to my chest- the poor kid\u2019s face was beet red. It has been quite a ride, but this needle you speak of, I have never been offered such a miraculous option. Usually they stop my heart with the shock and awe machine. Only once did they have to do it twice. I\u2019m knocking on wood to tell you the last one was November. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve just jinxed myself\u00a0:) but, I still figure it is better than the medicine! ", "title": "", "parent": "213", "creatorid": "a2f2603c79a9", "id": "81510200d4c1"}
