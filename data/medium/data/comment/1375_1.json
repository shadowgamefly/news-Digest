{"name": "1375_1", "child": "", "content": "Key Elements In Building Trustworthy Knowledge System Per your request, our approach to building a trustworthy system has the following elements \u2014 Database starts by defining what constitutes \u201cideal\u201d content within each topic area. Using pro research librarians, there area numerous criteria that are rated on a scale for importance to each topic, thus the ideal varies for each topic.Multiple experts within each topic area identified are vetted for any real or perceived conflict of interest.Multiple experts within each topic area identify what they consider to be the top 5\u20138 superior providers of content in their area of expertise and rate each provider on the same criteria list for an ideal but without knowing what is ideal.Algorithm compares expert ratings for each content provider against ideal ratings to generate numerical percentage of adequacy in reaching the ideal, and then rank lists all the superior providers in that topic.Experts provide a curated description of each content provider\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.Users/consumers can see all expert biographies and actual ratings for each criteria on each content provider offered and, if desired, submit a different rating for any given criterion. If the disparity from a given number of users is wide enough the expert\u2019s recommendation and ratings are reviewed.Experts update their list of superior providers as warranted and queried at a preset time period. Users can recommend superior content providers not listed and are paid a bounty if review determines recommendation is superior.List of superior content providers can be displayed independently, adjacent to search results, accessed by virtual assistants and augmented reality systems. Hope this is clear enough to assess merit of our approach Doc Huston ", "title": "", "parent": "1375", "creatorid": "4561ce40d387", "id": "7f7b970b2ce1"}
