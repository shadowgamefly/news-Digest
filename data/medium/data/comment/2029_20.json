So much talent in the world.. and not enough pie. It\u2019s ironic though; the projects I do for money\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t care alot for. The ones I do for free- are the ones that matter the most. Guess I\u2019ve had to learn over the years to separate music that is business, and music that is artistry. One pays the pills, and the other is the only one I actually give a fuck about so I don\u2019t even think about money. However; you\u2019re right. We\u2019re all screwed in thousands of ways, but, there is always a solution and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not far from it. Thanks for the read, \u2018marketing scum\u2019. Hahaha, that is hilarious btw. Jokes aside; 5 minutes of my life well and truly spent. Cheers. ", "creatorid": "75099b312f06", "name": "2029_20", "parent": "2029"}
