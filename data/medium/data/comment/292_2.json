{"name": "292_2", "child": "", "content": "I recall working at the legendary HHCL in the late nineties. We found a document on the server called Clause 4. It outlined the idea of making all the creative dept freelance and \u2018casting\u2019 the teams in relation to the client briefs. The whole team were horrified. As much as we wall wanted to do high risk creative work. We wanted a low risk existence. Managing our own business affairs was not in our DNA. These days the networking and administrative tools are at our fingertips. And there is no reason to confine ourselves to one company. I\u2019d like to see more \u2018creatives\u2019 take the power and the value in their ideas back from the corporates that employ them.
