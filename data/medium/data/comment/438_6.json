{"name": "438_6", "child": "", "content": "Hi Matt, thought provoking post! I\u2019d like to take the opposite view and mention that our descendants may envy us also! For example, because of our lesser technology\u200a\u2014\u200amy job is in tech, but I sometimes remember wistfully a time where everyone around me didn\u2019t have a smartphone in their hands all of the time. I love seeing people reading actual books on the train, low-tech can be a better experience. Perhaps in the future, when we have implants to digitally enhance our lives, this connection to ever present technology will be even more pronounced; and some may look back at our \u201cbarbaric\u201d ways with jealousy. I\u2019d also mention aswell that loneliness may never be fully solved, VR companions or not; a person can be in a stadium full of people and still feel isolated and unconnected. Education and greater empathy could be more likely to reduce it. One final thing\u200a\u2014\u200aabout not killing animals. Since the advent of cars, the worldwide population of horses has plummeted; if we stopped eating cows, they may go extinct as we\u2019d have no reason to keep breeding them! Just a thought!
