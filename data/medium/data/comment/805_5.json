I have a \u201cguess\u201d that I would like to share with you and see what you think. Also need to mention that it\u2019s not a Saas business but everything you have mentioned here can be applied to my \u201cguess\u201d. Here it is: \u201cA service for designing and developing cross platform email templates\u201d. My main question is how do you initially price your service or what are the metrics you consider your first guess? Also what\u2019s your method to come up with these \u201cguesses\u201d\u00a0? I came up with my guess because I had two clients in the past few months that hired me for developing email templates.
