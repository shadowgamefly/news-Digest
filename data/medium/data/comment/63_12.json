{"id": "b9cae6af93d7", "content": "Hi Florin, My freeCodeCamp local group at Reading, UK is also very quiet. So much so that we have never actually pulled off a meet Up! When I joined fcc, end of March last year, the Facebook group administrator was trying to get a meet up arranged, but it never came off in the end. About, 2 \u2013 3 weeks ago a new member joined our group and he sounded very keen to get a meet up going; so far still nothing happening and I felt a bit guilty because a meet up for me would involve a sixty mile round trip to the local groups town and so I might not attend anyway. What I did do however, is open a new Github account and roughed out a very basic website with the intent of building a group website and also learning the application of Git and Github along the way. I then got in touch with him via Facebook to pass him the Github url. Just a day or so ago the new member I was speaking of did his first Github Pull Request on that repo and I, as administrator of the account, did my first merge! I can\u2019t tell you how please I was with that after being \u201cstuck in my coding silo\u201d for years I had actually collaborated with someone else! If you are doing this with your group please let me know if you can offer any advice and if you aren\u2019t then I hope you might try it yourselves. Your meet ups look amazing and I wish you much success with it in the future. Bye for now and happy coding! ", "creatorid": "ac33ce9e401f", "title": "", "parent": "63", "child": "", "name": "63_12"}
