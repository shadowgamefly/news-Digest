{"name": "18_14", "child": "", "content": "Amazing. You spent a whole year investigating Trump and a million dollars. Along the way you hit all the garbage talking points that the people who elected Trump realized were biased. You remind me of Woodward and Bernstein. They worked on the story to get Nixon for 2 years. In the end they got Nixon on 18 deleted minutes on a tape. Nixon had lied. What\u2019s amazing is that Hillary clintons foundation has raised over a billion dollars literally 100 times the size of the trump charity. There are scandals in Columbia and Haiti that some reporters have followed that indicate the clinton foundation has not been completely honest about how it has gotten or spent this billion dollars. Hillary is documented to have lied to the FBI, the sensate and the American people dozens of times. Hillary and her campaign is shown to have committed numerous dirty tricks that make anything Nixon did look like child\u2019s play. Of course you don\u2019t care about that. The only fairness is that nobody cares about your work. Nothing is going to happen because there is nothing to anything you wrote about. The president is not being investigated or indicted. On the other hand Hillary is still facing 2 large scale investigations into the massive pay for play and money laundering schemes she is almost certainly guilty of.
