Including their picture in the tweet without first understanding the context of the men\u2019s statements, or finding out more about who they were, was too much and rather bitchy. Maybe she was more interested in promoting herself via social media with an inflammatory tweet than correcting the men\u2019s behavior. If Richards had spoken to the men first, she might have found out they were decent guys. They may have even apologized. It could have turned out very differently.
