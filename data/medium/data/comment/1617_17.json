{"name": "1617_17", "child": "", "content": "I know what you and your family went through. I lost my husband at the age of 56 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. It will be 11 years on May 13th. My husband also had the same disease as your wife. He waited over 5 years for a liver. On May 5th, 2005 he had his transplant but only survived eight days. By the time a liver was found for him it was too late. I feel for you. It is a horrible experience to go through and you learn a lot. Please accept my condolences on the loss of your wife.
