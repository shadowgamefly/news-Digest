If I sense an absence of any possibility that any ensuing dialogue, however disputing in nature, will be meaningful or attended by at least a modicum of etiquette, damn straight I block them. End of argument, and good riddance. As for this \u201csilencing\u201d anyone, since when does one person exercising their sacred prerogative not to listen to another, constitute \u201csilencing\u201d them? They can go on and spout whatever they care to spout, lacking only the opportunity to spout it in my direction. I stand by the practice enthusiastically, with my motives answerable to no one, and will continue to enact it when I damn well please. As may anyone else, and I encourage it. If it is a way to limit some of these idiotic and pointless textual shouting matches, and I think it is, then I say \u201cblock away, and don\u2019t explain or apologize.\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1763", "creatorid": "bdc93f756837", "id": "7ba21175328f"}
