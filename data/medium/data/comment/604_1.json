It\u2019s easy to judge from the outside perspective, to say that I\u2019d have done this or that, but in the heat of the moment, we\u2019re all human and have our own self-preservation needs first. There are of course heroes and selfless individuals, but even they make preconceptions and assumptions about what is good or bad before doing the admirable thing. I loved the story.
