It came out of nowhere (so I thought) with severe vertigo (including vomiting) I was unable to eat, to get up and take care of myself\u200a\u2014\u200amy luck or better yet my savior, was a doctor/friend who came to my house and saw the state I was in and literally got me up and going again. This was 13 years ago. I was medically treated for months with the usual drugs and when I felt wonderful again I went off the medication without telling my doctor/friend, so one day, I started crying out of nothing, not understanding what the heck was happening\u200a\u2014\u200aI had no idea I was feeling like that because I was off the drugs\u200a\u2014\u200ato make the story short\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of going back and take the medication, I started taking St. John\u2019s Wart for a while, then slowly weaned it off, as I should have done (in the first place) with the medication, and have been fine ever since then. Do I feel depressed sometimes? Of course! That\u2019s totally normal! One cannot be on top of the world at all times\u2026I do not like to hear people confusing being depressed to having a depression though\u2026 but not everyone is well informed about everything either. I am a true believer that each experience is different because we are all different and after my own, I have been reading a lot about depression, where the medical authorities have not been able to arrive to a consensus, as to whether depression is an illness, a disorder or a condition. The easy way is to categorize it as an illness in order to justify keeping people on drugs for years\u2026people become happy again and the \u201cdrug industry\u201d stay forever happy! This is very sad! After all these years, after reading and hearing so many different opinions, it is my understanding depression is a condition that can lead to illness. This condition functions as an alarm the body sends to let us know we have to change something we are doing wrong. To wrap it up: I do believe my problems are not bigger than yours\u200a\u2014\u200athey are just different. I do believe everyone has problems and stress\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to minimize or solve them is a capacity we have to learn, within us, in order to have a better life. Thank you for sharing your experience Lisa! Be happy\u00a0:) ", "name": "2133_1", "id": "7e520fef01e7"}
