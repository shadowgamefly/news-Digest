{"id": "cd3184ddcb14", "content": "There is clearly a time and a place for a good UI and drag/drop interaction (ahem visualization), and it\u2019s awesome to see people starting to draw a more clear line between the right place and wrong place. I think we see eye to eye on the peril of UI based drag and drop ETL solutions, but not everyone agrees. You didn\u2019t even mention UC4/Automic which is still used at some large companies. Once a given tool is established as the way to solve scheduling and dependency resolution for ETL and plumbed into the infra, it\u2019s always a root canal to replace, even when a majority of the organization would prefer something more programmatic. I\u2019d love to hear some success stories for organizations moving from one tool to another. Where do you start? Even Spark has dependency on the UI for debugging issues in apps, when more straightforward logging would do the trick with less effort, but the JSON API is incomplete compared to the UI. Any solution that buries frequently needed information or functionality behind a dozen clicks seems clearly broken, when the same could be easily accessed from good logging and APIs.
