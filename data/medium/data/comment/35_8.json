I would love to have a good blog and love to be able to use tools to be able to communicate more effectively. I just don\u2019t know where [which platform? Wordpress? Other? homegrown?] or how [if I do Wordpress, it\u2019s a learning curve, is it worth it? Does it have what is needed?]?? One thing I do like a lot about Medium is the linked content and the daily in mail of topics I\u2019d be interested in and who I follow. I don\u2019t know if other blogs do or don\u2019t have these features\u200a\u2014\u200athey seemed to, to a degree, but not quite as evolved as Medium.
