And right there is the reason why I am glad I got a \u201cslap on the face\u201d from this article. I barely get enough rest, and when I wake up the first thing I do is complain. It has become such a habit that everything that I do throughout the day is filled with negativity and anxiousness. I lie to myself saying \u201ceverything is fine\u201d while sitting inside a house on\u00a0fire. After I read your piece I realized that what you do or what you feel in the morning can really, really affect everything that follows. So now I\u2019ll take your advice, and log myself out of the nonsense I have put myself in. Thank you very much. ", "title": "", "parent": "251", "creatorid": "84856139c622", "id": "e3f04e7ba047"}
