The firearm owned by many American revolutionaries was significantly better than the standard issue firearm of most standing armies. The founding fathers intent was to insure that people had access to firearms that were on par or better than any opposing force, foreign or domestic. And beyond rifles, it was common for one or two families in a community to maintain the cannons. If the founding fathers were around now they wouldn\u2019t be lamenting the ability to own a semi-automatic firearm, they would be lamenting the Firearms Act of 1934 that prevents easy access to _actual_ fully automatic, select fire assault weapons and the community owned howitzers. Your racist description rings pretty hollow unless you also have a problem with the other 9 amendments in the Bill of Rights. ", "child": "", "id": "c18a6ca1a395", "title": ""}
