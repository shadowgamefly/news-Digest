{"name": "1838_5", "child": "", "content": "When My partner of twenty-five years died suddenly, his death brought pain, anger, bewilderment and loss upon two women. This man had created a dual life. He never thought to clean up the mess later in life. He let her and I deal with the cataclysm of his end life. After going through so much since that time of 2013, I have become a better person. Through fire and anguish I can be the person who now has wisdom. I would like to add that I have always kept that part of youth that allows for one to experience joy over simple things. Today, on my walk from the pool, I found $2.00! The magic of receiving something from nothing. I also, enjoy the way a child can concentrate on a task that brings them shear pleasure. Kids can spend hours digging in dirt. Children at an early age experiment. From taking their first walk to holding a crayon to color. That is something adults can certainly take cues from.
