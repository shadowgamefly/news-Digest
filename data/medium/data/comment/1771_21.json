First thought: You\u2019ve permanently colored the terms \u201cculture fit\u201d, \u201cpersonalization\u201d, and \u201csafe spaces\u201d for me. I\u2019m glad to have the idea that ease and preference in this domain are diametrically opposed to growth & understanding. Second thought: Our real-life, in-person diversification projects need lots of support as you say, but turning around the trends you mention (privatization of the military, tech-mediated experiences in our formative years) doesn\u2019t seem likely. How can we approximate those experiences? Media experiences could help. I\u2019m imagining shows about the very compelling conflict of people from across our national divide thrown together in their first year at college, on military deployment, etc. Not just using that conflict as a set piece, but digging deep into it with real curiosity about each character and exploring what things can actually be resolved and what things can\u2019t.
