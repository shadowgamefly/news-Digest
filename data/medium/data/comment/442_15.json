{"name": "442_15", "child": "", "content": "\u2018one of the obvious big questions is: why are you here? What is your purpose?\u2019 Well that\u2019s two questions but as the answer to Q2 always provokes the first part of Q1 I\u2019ll let it slide. WHY\u00a0? A good question might at first glance conjure up a simple answer but when you start to delve (with the childlike \u2018but why\u00a0?\u2019) it opens up many more questions, the more you try to explain, the less sure you become of the answer. The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42, but why\u00a0? Our purpose (and that includes all alien and ai lifeforms) is to try to answer the unanswerable question of why. Look forward to seeing the movie. ", "title": "", "parent": "442", "creatorid": "d107113b0382", "id": "9999640c5c02"}
