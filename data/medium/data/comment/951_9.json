{"name": "951_9", "child": "", "content": "Very interesting article! I have some interesting questions that also relate to some challenges I\u2019ve been facing as a Data Engineer. Do your events have any sort of schema? If yes, how do you enforce it and what serialization do you use?Do you guys use Kafka as an \u201cmessage queue\u201d?I assume you use Scala to write your event handlers? Do you use something like Akka Streams?Why Scala and not Java or Kotlin? Did you already have some people experienced with Scala? How was the learning curve for people new to the language and what did you do to make it smoother? (PS: I love Scala!) Once again, thanks for the great post! Looking forward to read more from your team? ", "title": "", "parent": "951", "creatorid": "76ac14b80364", "id": "529af35e6453"}
