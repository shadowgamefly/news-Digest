Social media has changed priorities these days and we have become indolent and more dependent. Excessive use of Social media effects our ability to concentrate on significant work and critical thinking abilities. I realized this when recently I got blocked on Facebook for 60 days\u00a0. And intially I felt like I have lost a part of my life\u00a0. It made me so depressed for two or three days because I wasn\u2019t able to reply unnecessary messages or argue with people on random pages on irrelavant pages or read and like people\u2019s opinions on thier posts. I tried to find some alternatives like Twitter or instagram but they didn\u2019t work for me and I realized that I was wasting so much time on social networks that I wasn\u2019t giving much time on my personal growth. I had plenty of time so I start rebuilding my habits and created some habits that don\u2019t involves social media at all,\u00a0e.g., reading books,sports,learning mixed martial arts,singing. I am expending my skills by learning new things everyday and It has made me confident\u00a0. Excessive use of Social media is harmful\u00a0. Because We\u2019re all just a bundle of habits shaped by our memories. Thank you for the article. ", "title": "", "parent": "1733", "creatorid": "984e8f978260", "id": "613ae8cc441a"}
