{"name": "594_19", "child": "", "content": "Comparing against conversational interfaces misses the point, in a way that we keep seeing. (Last year it was constantly missing the reason for smart watches\u2026) Part of the magic of computing is that it gets cheaper and cheaper. There is no NEED for A to replace B. A and B can both hang around and do their jobs well. It\u2019s not even trucks vs cars; it\u2019s screwdrivers vs hammers. As for Apple, while they have plenty of faults, this is the one area in which I see no need to worry. Apple has been at the forefront, since at least the iPod, of understanding that the future is a personal compute cloud, not a single uber-device that does everything. The underlying technologies of AppleID and authentication, iCloud, and Continuity provide a framework that, while still immature and buggy (and missing a vast amount of necessary technical and UI features) is still a better foundation for putting together these sorts of distributed personal compute ecosystems than anyone else has. Unlike every other company (MS and Windows everywhere, Google and its hopeless pursuit of the tablet) Apple is defined by their insistence on the right UI for every particular computing device. They seem to me likelier than anyone else to ship a conversational computing device that both arrives a year laster than everyone else AND that shows everyone else just how well conversational computing can work when it operates on an entire cluster of devices (watch, phone, TV, iMac) rather than is limited to the UI of a single speaker box.
