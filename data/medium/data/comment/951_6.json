Some reports can\u2019t even be generated anymore because we have too much transactions. This post is a fascinating outlook of how things can be ran at big corp. I always wondered how big companies did accounting. This stuff can\u2019t be outsourced since it\u2019s so tightly coupled to your business logic.
