{"name": "1554_13", "child": "", "content": "Someone, anyone please enlighten me on exactly how requiring an ID to vote is discriminatory to blacks and hispanics. The fact is blacks usually live in an urban area where there is ample transportation to and from a DMV to attain a valid photo ID, whereas poor whites usually live in rural areas where public transportation is very limited. If anything voter ID discriminates against poor whites. This is just another excuse for the democrats to continue using illegals and blacks to vote multiple times.
