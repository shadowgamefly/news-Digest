Cities such as Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston, etc.. are all liberal cities in liberal leaning states and all have strong economies. There are exceptions to this, Charlotte, NC is a somewhat liberal city in a conservative state like NC, but by and large, liberal economic policies work better for everybody than conservative trickle down economies, see Kansas.
