Flight cancelled due to snow, and airlines (Jetblue and Aer Lingus) wouldn\u2019t help us with rerouting because they said Expedia had to do it. Expedia said they couldn\u2019t help; the supervisor I spoke to even lied saying she couldn\u2019t access our file. Unless one has tons of time to spend on the phone unraveling all the problems that arise on at least 50% of Expedia reservations, stay away from Expedia (and probably the other aggregators as well).
