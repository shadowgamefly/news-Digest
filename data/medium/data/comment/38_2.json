{"content": "Hoiberg\u2019s success at ISU was based on one big who could step out and shoot 3s, and four wings who were either slashers or 3 point shooters (preferably both). He has yet to have the roster in Chicago to fit his style: his \u201cinconsistent\u201d rotation is due to his efforts to find a rotation that works consistently. It\u2019s almost as if the front office is intentionally trying to sabotage him by bringing in players who are a bad fit for his system, but I can\u2019t imagine any front office doing that (cough \u201cSanta Clara 49ers\u201d cough). Butler is having a career year, and McBuckets and Mirotic are coming along, so there may still be hope. The real problem is players who are defenders (Gibson, Portis, Lopez) or scorers (McDermott, Mirotic, Valentine) but no two way players other than Butler.
