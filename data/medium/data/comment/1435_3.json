The Liberal ideology doesn\u2019t trust individuals with their liberties, and instead wants to give our government all our liberties in order to enshrine their beliefs into law. All laws, to one degree or another, take away some of our liberties. Some laws are reasonable restrictions on liberties, such as those against murder, rape and kidnapping. But other laws encroach on our liberties beyond what is just and reasonable. Liberals who demand laws that take our liberties want the government to enforce\u200a\u2014\u200aby law\u200a\u2014\u200atheir liberal beliefs at the cost of our liberties. The more laws we have, the fewer liberties we have, and this stealing of our liberties is ALWAYS touted as being \u201cfor our own good.\u201d The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
