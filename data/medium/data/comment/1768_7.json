Only caveat is that it\u2019s slow, outdated\u200a\u2014\u200ain danger of being \u201cmisused\u201d through technology\u200a\u2014\u200aand most of all, rarely looks back at old law to undo them as society moves on and new interpretations might miss their initial mark, if not do worse. Having said that, even legal systems differ greatly, comparing common law in your land with European civil law, remains a subject for comparison in terms of fairness and efficiency.Keep up the great work and thank you for the continuous inspiration!
