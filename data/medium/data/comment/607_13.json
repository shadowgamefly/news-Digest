{"name": "607_13", "child": "", "content": "Could you elaborate on how we\u2019re driving out creatives? Are the artists we send orders to not good enough, not deserving of their work? I was born there, so I certainly hope Chinese people aren\u2019t prejudiced by their race or country. I live with 2 artists in San Francisco, and American artists are under no threat from artists who paint lower cost portrait paintings. More capable artists have jobs at Pixar, Disney, Zynga, and other companies in the entertainment and gaming industry as concept artists and game artists, and artists who lack these opportunities are content to not have to replicate paintings now that we send custom commissions. We enable them to make a living doing what they\u2019re already doing. ", "title": "", "parent": "607", "creatorid": "af1cdd8bb5cd", "id": "1714acf07ee0"}
