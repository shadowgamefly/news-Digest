{"name": "1016_3", "child": "", "content": "Really good points. I\u2019ve recently started implementing a similar workflow. The issue I\u2019m running into is that I\u2019m solely a designer and often times hand off my designs to one of our developers to work their magic. Currently that hand off consists of a set of static comps showing all the different page layouts/views and a stickersheet with various UI elements and their different states laid out, as well as a set hierarchy for typography. I\u2019ll usually build out clickable prototypes in Invision or Adobe XD to show how certain features work, but those don\u2019t usually get handed over. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to do this without the static comps (wireframes)\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "1016", "creatorid": "64743d1df07f", "id": "fa220f382dc"}
