Walking around the Strip or downtown Vegas is a lot like many websites, every ten feet someone is calling out to you, or trying to give you a sample of something smelly or snapping a desk of cards to get your attention and then jamming one in your face. I\u2019m walking hand-in-hand with my wife; what makes you think I want nude girls sent direct to me for fun? You can only take strangers invading your space for so long. You say no thanks and they keep talking, try to ignore them and they yell louder or follow you. See them on your return trip and they literally don\u2019t remember you and do the same crap all over again. These people get paid to be mindless hawkers, just like internet advertisers. It\u2019s kind of sad\u2026 so many people thinking it\u2019s ok to shove crap in your face hoping you pay just to make them go away\u2026 How can you be proud of the money you make if you can\u2019t be proud of how you made it?
