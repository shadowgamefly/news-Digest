This doesn\u2019t show I\u2019m wrong, it just means you\u2019re doing the wrong thing. Judging from your comment, the right thing for you would be: Your significant other finds a job in SF (you work from home so you have a big advantage).You find a cheap[er] place that\u2019s (maximum) 10 miles from where your significant other works, so he can bike there every day (more details here).You move to SF.

If those solutions aren\u2019t humanly possible for any reason, study stoicism or something that would make you appreciate your current situation more (meditation, yoga, gratitude, religion\u2026 anything). That might make you happy with what you have. But all you\u2019re doing right now is blaming: Your apartment complex\u2019s residents.Strangers in Teslas.My post.The Bay Area.
