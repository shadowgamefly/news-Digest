{"name": "442_7", "child": "", "content": "Great article\u200a\u2014\u200aabout the science of interstellar travel, but I think you, as well as mainstream science miss the idea of ET contact and how it will have less to do with material science and more to do with connecting consciousness, both ours and theirs. According to academic mainstream science, somehow, it\u2019s all going to occur using radio waves (a la \u201cContact\u201d) or some kind of air based communication, using our vocal chords to communicate to ETs who do something back in their vocal chords for us to figure out. The reality is that ETs will most likely use some sort of telepathic communication. This idea comes from the anecdotal evidence as purported by people who claim to have actual experiences in ET contact, as well as people who claim to be abductees. I suggest you take a look at the work of Dr. Steven Greer from The Disclosure Project. http://www.disclosureproject.org/ I already know how it goes almost without saying that such ideas are to be immediately dismissed out of hand according to Academic Science Religion which states that if you cannot put it in a test tube it has no merit, and as such it\u2019s all pseudoscience. Got it. Don\u2019t go out on a limb you\u2019ll risk your grants and paychecks. Greer\u2019s work shows that people who can achieve meditative states of consciousness, and can remote view out into the cosmos, can indeed make contact, and invite ETs to come. This is no longer what academics consider pseudoscience, but has been documented in plain sight. There are numerous video documentations showing how people are indeed using telepathic communication to communicate with ETs. Check out Greer\u2019s work at http://www.disclosureproject.org/.
