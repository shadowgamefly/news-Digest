I met several people at the women\u2019s marches yesterday who had also already marched\u2026 in the civil rights movement of the 60s, in ACT UP, in the climate change march, in a dozen other causes. They too, were derided by their so-called allies. But they never thought that staying home and yelling I told you so made them a better person. March or don\u2019t march, just reconsider your smug tone. ", "title": "", "parent": "957", "creatorid": "3aeaa46a3ebf", "id": "2d0852bfd92"}
