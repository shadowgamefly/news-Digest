Nearly nothing is undetermined. And yet. Lots of developers I\u2019m working with aren\u2019t understanding the benefit of \u201edrawing by numbers\u201c. In fact they don\u2019t even read the treatments. Sometimes I\u2019m doing mockups with hype (for smartphone apps) to show both, clients and developers how the interactions are meant. So yes, you\u2019re right. Wireframes are a waste of time. ", "title": "", "parent": "1016", "creatorid": "e47161ba0c40", "id": "45f55fde4316"}
