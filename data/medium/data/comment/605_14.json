{"name": "605_14", "child": "", "content": "Thanks Derek. In most of these situations, I\u2019ve found that at the time you have to make the hard decisions, none of the options look easy or good. If they did, you would have already taken that path. In my personal experience, I\u2019ve tended to close my eyes, imagine what each potential option looks like if executed to its fullest possible extent and chosen the one with the highest potential impact/upside. Since life is short and whichever path one chooses requires an enormous amount of mental, emotional and physical energy, I think it\u2019s hugely important to work on things that you feel personally passionate about.
