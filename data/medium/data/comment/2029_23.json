Long before the internet existed, the same problem occurred only it was much worse (look up\u201cpayola\u201d on a search engine). Today, it\u2019s actually easier to get paid directly for your work. I\u2019m a \u201ccreative\u201d and I do it all the time. And I damn sure don\u2019t charge 10 cents for something that took me an hour (or more!) to create. I can\u2019t speak for Drake or whomever, but most famous musicians make most of their money on concerts and merchandise, not streams and royalties. Why? Because their customers aren\u2019t paying the distributor. The ONLY reason to have a distributor is to increase \u201cbrand awareness\u201d, not to make money (directly). Also, quit complaining about being criticized. If people went to all the trouble to write you and call you a \u201csell out\u201d then at least they care. Far worse to be ignored.
