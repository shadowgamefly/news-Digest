Why not support economic diversity, especially when it improves transportation options for so many people worldwide? As a hearing-impaired person, I remember having to use a pay phone to try to call a cab, which would be very stressful. Most of the time, no cabs were available. Problems such as a driver supply-demand issue or a zealously driven, results-oriented culture are not unique to Uber. Yet, with Uber, I can relax, knowing I can get transportation easily without a phone call and I\u2019ll know exactly how long I have to wait instead of the old days, when I\u2019d be waiting in a dark corner, not knowing when or whether a cab would show up. If we want to castigate companies based on their worst moments\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially ones based on one-sided testimony\u200a\u2014\u200awouldn\u2019t we live in a homogeneous world?
