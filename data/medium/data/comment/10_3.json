{"id": "b6d3bc175300", "content": "You have Stephen King, but you missed several similar books by other extremely successful writers. For instance Lawrence Block has several books on writing that are in King\u2019s class. His \u201cWrite for Your Life\u201d, \u201cTelling Lies for Fun & Profit\u201d and \u201cSpider, Spin me a Web\u201d are well worth a look. Ray Bradbury, P.D. James, and quite a number of other well published 20th Century writers have produced \u201cHow To\u201d guides. Norman Mailer\u2019s \u201cThe Spooky Art: Thoughts on Writing\u201d is another. I know a number of successful authors who praise Francine Prose\u2019 \u201cReading like a Writer\u201d. There are a lot out there, but I regard those published by writers with a long and successful writing career with more respect than those published by people with no evident success in the field. Amazon is filled with advice books produced by people with no catalogue. ", "creatorid": "515d013f4479", "title": "", "parent": "10", "child": "", "name": "10_3"}
