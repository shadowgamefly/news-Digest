I did, too, in my rural Midwest school: I recall learning notes and singing as early as second grade. By fifth grade, I was playing flute, and I continued all the way through high school, learning to play sax and oboe, too! Now, I live in a central California town, where we have one full-time high school band director. There are other music teachers who teach full-time, but their days are split up, with them teaching other academic courses and even driving from several grade schools to middle school to fine arts academy just to remain full-time. So I agree that it is difficult to forsee public schools going back to the model we grew up with. And, as you said, at least the kids are getting a start. Technology, in the case of your Alexa project, becomes a bridge, not the main source of education. Well put! ", "creatorid": "521c304e720c", "title": "", "parent": "61", "child": "", "name": "61_15"}
