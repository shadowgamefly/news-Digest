{"name": "805_4", "child": "", "content": "These are great questions. You\u2019re right\u200a\u2014\u200athere are a lot of things that I personally consider. I wrote Part 1 assuming that the people reading it would be those who had some idea they wanted to build a startup out of. In short and to give you something to work off of, my main considerations are: Size of marketWillingness of market to pay for a solution (and how much)Ease of reaching said market I don\u2019t make every decision based on dollars. But I definitely make sure that if I do something that I will get some ROI on my time, as I view my time as more valuable than money. I\u2019ve done the niche thing before. If the niche is easily reachable and relatable, it\u2019s a great strategy. If the niche is not easily reachable, it can be a real pain in the ass (or a nice defensive strategy against competition). It all depends. But as a rule of thumb, I\u2019ve stopped going after niches that I don\u2019t personally have experience in. I\u2019ve found the learning curve saps so much time and energy, plus a lot of times I\u2019ve found out that I\u2019m just not the right person to deliver a solution in that space. Most niche customers only want to do business with fellow niche insiders, not random technologists bearing dubious solutions of their interpretation of the niche\u2019s problems. Hope this helps. Maybe I need to do a \u201cPart Zero\u201d for The Epic Guide to talk about idea generation and all of these considerations? There\u2019s definitely enough there to do so.
