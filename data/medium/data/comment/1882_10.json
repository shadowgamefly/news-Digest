{"name": "1882_10", "child": "", "content": "Yes! Thank you for your writing and addressing this issue. I think this is something that is all to often left out in the tech world\u200a\u2014\u200apower as much as privilege\u200a\u2014\u200aand it is for me one of the most important things that should be discussed. People also have a right to (and are able to) understand at least the logics of the technologies they use everyday. I try and encourage others to get into tech through what interests them (whether it be cooking, dancing, etc.) to feel more understood and empowered. With all that is happening in the world, this is one part of my way of contributing for the better. But I want to do more and I\u2019m trying to find my way of fighting, my voice in these issues. And your idea of creating and allow for understanding (especially through tech) really is at the centre of it all. Also, related to your idea that you mention that groups of individuals feel like children, you might find this article interesting: \u201cThe Babysitter\u2019s club\u201d by Jesse Barron in Real Life Mag. Relating as well to current events, this quote is striking: We\u2019re in the middle of a decade of post-dignity design, whose dogma is cuteness. One explanation would be geopolitical: when the perception of instability is elevated, we seek the safety of naptime aesthetics. There\u2019s a lot to process here, and a lot of possibilities. I think if we can each find our own way to generate understanding\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever that may be\u200a\u2014\u200ait is some small steps in the right direction, but I guess we will also need institutional change of some sort in the end. But for now, I will keep on with my small little battles, and hopefully others too. Thanks again for creating a space for this discussion!
