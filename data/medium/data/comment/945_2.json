{"name": "945_2", "child": "", "content": "I think this is doubling down on predatory capitalism. Almost all services directed at the extreme poor are making them poorer. If you seed that market, you will just be putting blood in a already infested shark water. PLease learn to discern between Government handouts to corporations (Obamacare) and actual social measures that help the extreme poor. Rule of thumb, if you still buy things, it\u2019s a government handout for corporations. The poor are by definition imperfect consumers because they don\u2019t have choice. This makes them the low hanging fruit of capitalism. Stop listening to neo-liberal propaganda. More of the same will not help. It will just reduce economic freedom and real opportunity.
