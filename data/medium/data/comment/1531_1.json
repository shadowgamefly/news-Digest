{"name": "1531_1", "child": "", "content": "As was said in the article. This is just one of 34 campaign promises he went back on. whether is for NK issues or not I will not debate, because this shows a blatant pattern of just saying something to get elected, and then going back on it when it suits your immediate needs. The fact is that we cannot know what he intended to keep as promises or not but when faced with these situations over and over he constantly goes back on his word. Whether its because he was liar, or just incompetent, I do not know. To me though both things are enough to warrant labeling him completely incompetent to run a high political office.
