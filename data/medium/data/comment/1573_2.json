Republicans paid then-Senator Hillary Clinton this respect when she was nominated for Secretary of State. There are few traditions that survive this long in America. I\u2019m just sad to see it go. It\u2019s a nice idea better suited for the ideal of a politics that is about governing rather than the partisan bloodsport it has now becomr. Elizabeth Warren, like Donald Trump, thrives on conflict and stoking grievances. A couple years ago, Ted Cruz tried to pull the same stunt when he called McConnell a liar on the floor.
