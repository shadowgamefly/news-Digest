Even though the specific if example you use would work in modern JavaScript if such next-line syntax is used after the return, yield or several other keywords you get the worst bug possible in JavaScript, (called out in Crockford\u2019s Aweful Parts), because it is valid JavaScript but does not do what is expected. This is the sort of thing employers would fire a programmer for if discovered (and the main reason most projects of any significant size do not use JavaScript without a bunch of safety nets). Bradley Braithwaithe has an excellent write up on this. ", "title": "", "parent": "410", "creatorid": "4313a0a6db02", "id": "d8c1ce8b3958"}
