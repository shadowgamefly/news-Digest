{"name": "1556_9", "child": "", "content": "The Missouri plan isn\u2019t that wonderful. Like other Progressive Era reforms, it takes power away from voters, who are assumed to be incompetent to elect a judge, but then lets the voters decide whether or not to retain a judge\u200a\u2014\u200abased on what criteria? If we\u2019re going to amend the Constitution, the Federal Reserve Board is a good model: Staggered 14 year terms, so that almost every President gets a chance to pick 1\u20132 justices. Few justices die in office or unexpectedly retire. The justice must be confirmed by the Senate, but there could be a mandatory time limit on confirmation, so that if the Senate doesn\u2019t act within the time limit, the justice is considered to be confirmed. Just convince 2/3 of the Congress and 3/4 of the states and we\u2019re good. ", "title": "", "parent": "1556", "creatorid": "14f8f19f7d9", "id": "b417d67544ca"}
