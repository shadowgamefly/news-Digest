Its so easy to have your standards, expectations take over and even more when you isolate yourself. You expect people to perform to your standard, see by your right and wrong. You expect things to turn out\u00a0\u2026 well, the way you expect them to. I expect having the mindset of low expectations motivates you. What are my expectations after graduation from Computer Science come July, am I expecting companies to come knocking on my door, for an abundant supply of work. What are my expectations when it comes to finance. Now when I consider these things, I\u2019m quite hopeful. Just don\u2019t expect it. Don\u2019t expect the world from yourself. And that\u2019s it, don\u2019t expect\u200a\u2014\u200ajust do. ", "title": "", "parent": "318", "creatorid": "7243f08ba619", "id": "fe94fa455bab"}
