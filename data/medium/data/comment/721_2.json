{"name": "721_2", "child": "", "content": "Good work. Just a suggestion. It\u2019s very important to figure out the \u201cwhy\u201d and the real \u201cpain points\u201d behind users\u2019 reactions and behaviors. For example: \u201cPain point 1: Users are confused about how search results are ordered and displayed.\u201d This is not really \u201cpain point\u201d but users\u2019 reactions. What made users confused? It is because the results shown in a way that doesn\u2019t match their mental model (and what\u2019s their \u201cmental model\u201d)? Or it doesn\u2019t label the sorting method (distance, price etc) so that users don\u2019t know how it is displayed. And very important, what is the exact user needs for \u201csearch results\u201d? What are the most important information for users? How can we help users find the most valuable information and make the right decisions fast? \u201cPain point 2: Users did not find the current sort bar helpful\u201d Why not helpful? What are not helpful to users? What do users need? \u201cPain point 3: Users expressed that they were most interested in reviews and rating but did not navigate to the \u201crestaurant information\u201d page\u201d \u201cExpressed interest\u201d is not \u201cpain point\u201d, \u201cdid not navigate to a page\u201d is not a \u201cpain point\u201d but a behavior which was observed by you. What made them \u201cdid not navigate to\u2026\u201d? The way it placed (in a not obvious location)? Or restaurant information is not important to users. What are the \u201crestaurant information\u201d? How about \u201cphone number\u201d or \u201copen hour\u201d or other information that might be useful? Why do users say they are most interested in reviews and rating? What the value of \u201creviews and rating\u201d for them? Obviously can help them make better and faster decision, right? What else they care about? Ask Why, a lot of Whys, until you really figure out the \u201cpain points\u201d, not user response, not user behaviors, not your observations, not your assumptions, or even not \u201cusability\u201d issues.
