{"name": "442_8", "child": "", "content": "Arthur Clarke once said, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d As a life long science fiction reader-65 years-that\u2019s as good an explanation as I need. the movie isn\u2019t about science but communication. From a science point of view the alien\u2019s control of gravity is the big story and that\u2019s not even mentioned in the film. I think math would be the first step in communicating with them but prime numbers? How do they count? And would it be base 7 rather than base 10? Interesting movie. For another view of first contact try First Contact, a short story by Murray Leinster, which would make a cracking film.
