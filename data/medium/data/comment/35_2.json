While you played the what-if game and did some educated guessing, the OP focused on the small sample size of video that\u2019s there, plus the stats, and made little to no assumptions. That being said, it is a fact that Westbrook, for whatever reasons, is the only player in more than half a century to be as trip-dubby as The Big O\u200a\u2014\u200aand even the OP, possibly to avoid said speculation, can or will not really make sense of it, he just has to accept it like we all do. Even with roughly 90% of video data missing from back then, it should be undeniable that today\u2019s players are more evolved and would crush the early League. After all, those were the giants on whose shoulders they are standing nowadays. Concerning your extrapolation of Westbrook\u2019s stats to back then\u200a\u2014\u200athey might be accurate in regards to their deviance from the League average, but at the same time they neglect that back then, the pool of human beings that the league derived its players from was nothing in comparison to today, and players like Westbrook, LeBron, Shaq etc. would have been much more likely to become impossible outliers like Wilt\u200a\u2014\u200aor the Big O. It requires some special prerequisites to be a Bill Russell, Wilt or Big O, but it also comes with a certain boost to be such a special player in a league as weak as back then\u2026and if you adjust for the lack of basketball common knowledge back then when transporting Big O to today, you should also adjust for Russ, who probably would find a way to dribble the ball a little earlier if it were called\u2026 By the way, it might be just me, but your last sentence can easily be read as patronizing: \u201c Good writeup, can tell you have a way with words and hopefully had fun writing it.\u201d.
