I\u2019ll subscribe to Ezra Klein\u2019s idea that politics has completely devolved into identity and I\u2019ll add that the Democratic Party has failed to create a unifying identity. Obama the candidate used uniting oratory, but Obama the President retreated into governance by interest group alignment. It was interesting that Obama was so inspiring as a candidate and so boring as a President. Hillery campaigned like Obama governed. I get it that many worthy projects are premised on the idea of identity, but without a unifying identity it is ultimately a program for anarchy. PS Where\u2019s the underlying fight now? Communism vs capitalism has been replaced by Oligarchs against the people. It\u2019s not that we want to level everything down, but we need leaders, especially the capitalist, to lead like America is the shining city on a hill. The \u201cKoch crowd\u201d is looking more and more like the Russian Oligarchs. Von Mises and Rand have led you down a blind and dead end ally. Come to your senses Gorsuch.
