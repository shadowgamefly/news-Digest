{"name": "1560_7", "child": "", "content": "The \u201crevolution\u201d requires persons to be awake, and this \u201cawareness\u201d must be focused on \u201cprimary causes\u201d not the effects of them, and YOU are 253 YEARS past, what caused this. The people that revolted back then, wanted to be \u201cincluded\u201d by those that gained CONTROL of the \u201cthen\u201d colonies in 1763\u2026..and the \u201ccolonies\u201d has contributed \u201clittle\u201d to the \u201cvictory\u201d, and such things cost money and was for all intents and purposes, a world war fought by an aspiring \u201cempire\u201d who, while victorious, hither and yon, found themselves a bit pressed for \u201cmoney\u201d, back when money WAS MONEY. Some \u201ccolonists\u201d had it good, after all those initial \u201cthrusts\u201d\u2026\u2026and they managed to secure \u201choldings\u201d that were \u201cinherited\u201d\u2026.and those \u201cfamilies\u201d felt they deserved \u201cinclusion\u201d in the \u201caristocracy\u201d that was \u201cthe empire\u201d. Not only that BUT, this new and upstart \u201caristocracy\u201d had been built on \u201cslavery, land grabbing and speculation, and smuggling\u201d and after this \u201cconsolidation\u201d of the eastern seaboard of North America\u2026.they were looking westward and DROOLING!!!! BUT\u2026.the way west, did not belong to the \u201cempire\u201d, the mississippi and Ohio were its limits\u2026.spain was in florida and west, as were the french, and then spain again\u2026..and it was a mess. Not there was not LAND available WEST of the colonies, and it was calling\u2026..but it was occupied by the \u201cindigenous occupants\u201d and \u201cthe empire\u201d chose to allow them to continue to occupy it, as a buffer\u2026..it was exhausted and broke and it needed time\u2026so Franklin failed in his petition for Pennsylvania, and reps from Virginia also failed. \u201cThe empire\u201d also had no need for \u201cslaves\u201d, they had a sufficiently impoverished labor class to meet their needs\u2026.and they had already figured out that wage slavery worked, even with africans, so they began employing them as \u201csoldiers\u201d in the caribbean. ( and would do so after 1776 ) That left smuggling, and now that \u201cthe empire\u201d had won, this too was threatened in that the costs of victory needed to be recovered, and smuggling hindered that\u2026..so ultimately, the \u201cambitions\u201d of the colonists were blocked across the board\u2026.so the revolution was not fought for the nobel cause of freedom, but for the thwarted ambitions of those who had been excluded from the \u201caristocracy\u201d of empire, and the tyranny it imposed. The \u201ctyranny\u201d that threatened \u201cslavery\u201d. The \u201ctyranny\u201d that prevented western land grabs, land speculation and the genocide required to make it REAL. The \u201ctyranny\u201d that made smuggling of goods and slaves riskier. In short the thwarted ambitions of an excluded \u201caristocracy\u201d, who\u2026.after victory, constructed a \u201cgovernment\u201d to preserve it, while it pretended to be \u201csomething else\u201d\u2026.and whose history is a continual effort to preserve that ambition. The \u201crevolution\u201d did not succeed\u2026it simply passed control to \u201cothers\u201d who sought the same result\u2026.they are now \u201cthe empire\u201d and you are its victims.
