{"name": "1234_1", "child": "", "content": "Dear H, I have\u2019nt been very present on Medium since last summer, so I sort of guess that you have been going through really hard times for awhile. So have I. My mother\u2019s health went from bad to worse during the last year, and she passed away three months ago. I deleted my old Medium account four days after that, I have been back for about a month now. I won\u2019t go all \u201cmemoirish\u201d on you, this is just to say we seem to be in the same boat although for different reasons. Is it synchronicity is it G.O.D., it\u2019s all the same to me\u00a0: it is, I deal with it\u00a0, you deal with it, we deal with it. If we had\u2019nt had previous interactions here, I would\u2019nt have dared respond to you in such a direct way, and that this exchange could happen gave me one good reason to stay around a little longer. So thank you for your good words, and you are truly welcome ", "title": "", "parent": "1234", "creatorid": "56e754610571", "id": "6b7d358f3ca7"}
