{"name": "425_9", "child": "", "content": "I work in the accommodation industry. It\u2019s a joy to see accommodation providers yearning for more direct bookings. Exorbitant commission. That\u2019s one of the major driving forces. It makes my toes tingle to know that there is a battle, albeit a tiny one. Many accommodation owners aren\u2019t willing to bend over backwards for OTAs anymore. They\u2019re taking the fight to the OTAs. My wife and I had first-hand experience, while on honeymoon last year. We were peeking at the dinner menu one evening, while standing at the front desk. It was too expensive. So we asked about it, and the lady behind the counter told us that dinner was included in the price. It was one of the perks of making a direct booking. That\u2019s MORE than enough reason for us to NEVER use an OTA. There\u2019s something wrong in the OTA industry. If it considers draining its customers a good business practise, it needs reform. Companies like Guest.Direct are trying hard to bring together guests and accommodation establishments, but it\u2019s in infant stage. A long way to go still.
