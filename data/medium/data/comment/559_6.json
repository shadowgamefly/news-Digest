{"name": "559_6", "child": "", "content": "Another fine piece of observation coupled to your talent to convey great meaning. As one who often confuses polysyllabic offerings with meaningful utterance, I\u2019m grateful for how you framed this work. Your themes often call to mind my own upbringing in a small town in western PA, complete with tromping through the woods every chance I got and attending a small country church. While visual memories of that time remain sharp, your skill at translating your experiences into words consistently and effectively evokes fond memories.
