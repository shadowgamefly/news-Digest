{"name": "1879_8", "child": "", "content": "Thank you for sharing your story. My husband is half Persian and his dad lost everything to bring his children to the states in the 70s. He started all over again and became a successful business owner. I have so much respect for my father in law and for your mother too. To have lost her husband/your dad so young and still do whatever she could to make life a better place for the both of you is an incredible story and that incredible story continues through your success. Thank you again for sharing your inspiring story. ", "title": "", "parent": "1879", "creatorid": "37db20f7a5c6", "id": "e37a42a8bc1c"}
