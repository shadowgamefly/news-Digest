There have always been and there always will be, people in the world who are ONLY AS FAITHFUL AS THEIR OPTIONS. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are with at any given time. No one person is ever perfect or even enough for them because they will eventually be driven to look for the next new thing. It\u2019s who they are. People don\u2019t change unless they really fundamentally want to, and even then it is a steep uphill battle. My apologies for wading in with unsolicited advice. Cheating is a hot button topic for me and it chaps my backside when the person who was cheated on blames themselves. Please believe me when I say that you are enough and for the right person, you will be an embarrassment of riches. Wishing you smoother sailing ahead!
