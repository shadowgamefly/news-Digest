I don\u2019t think people have any understanding of how much time even simple wireframes take to make, factoring in breaks/devices/scaling and all the rest. I always feel that they provide little context and even a small change that needs to be actioned across them all can mean ages spent making adjustments across multiple layouts. I also feel that making wireframes without any styling or copy is pointless as both give the flat designs a lot of their context. I think we\u2019re moving to the point where prototyping tools are the only way to move forward- Adobe (finally) released the windows beta of XD the other day and even though it\u2019s early days it feels like a solution that solves at lot of the problems I\u2019ve been finding recently. I\u2019m glad someone has as Sketch so far also remains unavailable on Windows. ", "title": "", "parent": "1016", "creatorid": "a110128d8e31", "id": "403250d77286"}
