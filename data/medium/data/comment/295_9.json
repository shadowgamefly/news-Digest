{"name": "295_9", "child": "", "content": "Hey Tomas, These are my thoughts. Just because you choose to spend your personal time with more accomplished people, that doesn\u2019t mean that your work/career/business/mission (whatever you decide to call it), cannot be directed towards the ones that are looking for a way to grow. In my head, this scenario doesn\u2019t the reasoning that someone is better, or worse. Learn from the ones that you can, and help the others that need help with learning. But, if you spend more time with the more accomplished ones, you will grow more, ergo, your influence to everyone else can grow as well. Hope it makes sense!\u00a0:) ", "title": "", "parent": "295", "creatorid": "206228785f04", "id": "14027f5cb5da"}
