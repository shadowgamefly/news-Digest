S\u2019alright it\u2019s just the ageing process rather than being in the same shoes as you\u00a0:) Having worn those same shoes for a long time now, here\u2019s a few of my (sometimes painful) learnings: There\u2019s a tendency to create standards or make tooling decisions prematurely. It\u2019s always best done off the back of some real-world experience. TCP/IP\u2019s evolution is a great example of this. Corporations like standards because it means cost savings, great for the bean-counters but potentially lethal for technical work when the wrong tools are forced upon you. Test, learn, adjust.When making technical decisions, have the team make those choices. Sit in on the discussion, help it along, share your experience (last as you rightly observe) but if at all possible let the team decide. Which brings me to a more general point\u2026Your team(s) will be practising every second of the day what you only get to do occasionally, leverage their growing capability to mentor you. You\u2019ll have a nose for what\u2019s interesting or difficult, they\u2019ll be able to ground you in reality and teach you what you need to know about those things.Servant-leadership\u200a\u2014\u200aI can see that already in your words but IMO it\u2019s key. You\u2019re there to support the team, that means more than anything else, stepping back, helping them step forward. Your ultimate success is to make yourself redundant. Don\u2019t lead, be a peer, help them surface hidden issues, work with them to resolve them. My favourite question? \u201cWhat can I do to help you with x?\u201d I hope that helps!
