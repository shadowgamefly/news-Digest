{"content": "As a basketball fan, I would love for the 76ers to throw a ton of money at Wade this offseason. Having a leader like D-Wade in that locker room with young guys like Saric, Embiid, Simmons, Covington, Okafor, etc. would be huge for Philly. With Wade, that team might end up with a 4 seed in the East next year. 2 years/$48 million\u2026would be worth every penny.", "child": "", "parent": "35", "title": "", "creatorid": "93a1fa56373f", "name": "35_5", "id": "cfc6b0e3a0ec"}
