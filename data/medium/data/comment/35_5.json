{"name": "35_5", "child": "", "content": "Did you know he gets more possessions per minute than anyone in history right now? So in taking Westbrook back to 1962, you\u2019re taking back everything around Westbrook\u200a\u2014\u200aall medical, same coach, etc. And totally forgetting how he\u2019s performing relative to that environment (and yet, somehow it\u2019s going back with him to ALSO give him an advantage in 1962). Outliers, in their own season and/or generation Does Oscar, an outlier for over 50 years, not also still be an outlier? Westbrook has 41 triple doubles, but at a time when there\u2019s the most triple doubles in history. He\u2019s barely double the 2nd place player (Harden, 20) and 3rd (LeBron, 12) and so on. Today there have been 110 triple doubles. Westbrook has 41. Do you know how many of the triple doubles Oscar had in 1962? How much of an outlier was Oscar year over year of his career? How much is Westbrook? Basketball Training We can then talk about how good Oscar got without even having a functional gym in high school, as the original author noted. Take an NBA player from today and put him in 1995 would be an equivalent amount of \u2018extra\u2019 training Oscar would have gotten with just basic training necessities afforded to him. I\u2019m fine with or without the handcheck rule, but giving the transported player the \u2018environmental\u2019 benefits you are attributing to the era of the more advanced player, to the player in question, or in this case, Oscar. The Evolution of Human Size Per the health/nutrition angle. If you\u2019re giving Westbrook to 1962 you\u2019d probably have to take away those things. This is gesturing, which is harder to do than say statistical comparisons of a player in their era where vastly more variables are equal and can be accounted for. But let\u2019s try it. Let\u2019s look at what would become of Oscar, if you gave Oscar today\u2019s training, today\u2019s nutrition. Let\u2019s look at weight. A typical 15-year-old boy weighed 135.5 1966 and 150.3 pounds by 2002, an increase of 10.9%. The average weight for men rose \u201cdramatically,\u201d in the CDC\u2019s words, from 166.3 pounds in 1960 to 191 pounds in 2002, or 14.9%. Should we give Oscar 15% increase? Let\u2019s look at NBA players, specifically chosen (not true samples of population) over time. Let\u2019s take a look at height. The average height for men increased from just over 5-foot-8 in 1960 to 5\u20139 in 2002. One inch. 68 inches to 69 inches, or 1.4% taller. Not much. We\u2019ll get to NBA players in a second, just trying to establish as much apples to apples as we can. src: http://www.livescience.com/49-decade-study-americans-taller-fatter.html If you look at this study on heights of players on NBA rosters (doesn\u2019t mean they played that much, I took a study on height by mins played as to get a more \u2018true\u2019 height of height on the court). The average increase in height over time of NBA players from 1962 to 2015? 3.3% Oscar was 77 inches, he\u2019d get 2 inches. Westbrook is 75 inches, he\u2019d lose 2 inches. Oscar is now 6'7 in 2017, Westbrook is 6'1 in 1962. If you look at the same chart for weight from 1962 to 2015, the average goes from 200 pounds to 216 pounds, an increase of 8%. Oscar was 6'5 and from rookie year to later in his career somewhere between 205-225 pounds. So he\u2019d be 221 to 243 pounds if he came to today, just giving him the \u2018average\u2019 increase. Although, we should probably pro-rate how much of an outlier he was in 1962 to his fellow player and add that too. That would give Oscar a 12.5% increase [his outlier to his generation] * avg increase of all players, which comes to 13.5%. So in weight Oscar\u2019s weight has a range of 227\u2013255 lbs. So we\u2019d see Oscar rolling on the court at 6'7 253 pounds. Is there such an athlete today? Yes, his name is LeBron James. So physically, today, Oscar would be LeBron. But Oscar was also well above average in terms of shooting for his era. He even led the league in FT% twice. Players of this generation who led the league in FT% twice? Steve Nash, Reggie Miller, Peja Stojakovic. His FG% is 55% now mind you. His FT% would be around 90.4%. We can do some projections for his 3PT shot, but I don\u2019t have the data with me, it\u2019s on my database at home tho. I\u2019ll see if I can pull up some numbers if this picture isn\u2019t already apparent to you. If your curious on an actual study on bodies of athletes. You\u2019ll see it\u2019s more about selection and technology. So yes, as a whole, most players have progressed. But outliers, which most of these stars were\u200a\u2014\u200ahave no increased much. If fact, Wilt Chamberlain would still be more athletic than 99.9% of the athletes of today. Don\u2019t forget, he trained for the triple jump, the high jump (without advances of the \u201cFosbury Flop\u201d), the 400 meters, etc. Here\u2019s an actual study on athletes over time:  This is only a teaser, I suggest, if this topic interests you at all [whole basis of your argument], you should read the book. I have a few others I\u2019ll have to see if I can dig up. [I\u2019m trying to disprove my ignorance\u200a\u2014\u200ahow am I doing so far?] He\u2019s some closer looks at the super athletes training for a specific event and only 1\u20133 events total. How far they got with ALL the knowledge of what Oscar and Wilt had (plus much more, e.g. Fosbury Flop) plus nutrition, plus training, etc. World Record High Jump Progression: World High Jump Record ProgressionImage World High Jump Record Progression in Paul DeVos's images albumibb.co World Record Long Jump Progression: World Record Progression Long JumpImage World Record Progression Long Jump in Paul DeVos's images albumibb.co World Record Triple Jump Progression: World Record Progression Triple JumpImage World Record Progression Triple Jump in Paul DeVos's images albumibb.co Encouraged or discouraged? These are the best of the best getting all the advances in technologies used [hope you watched the TedTalk video, especially when today\u2019s athletes had to use the technologies of yesterday, e.g. 1962], advances in nutrition [no longer drinking rat poison and booze as \u201cperformance boosters\u201d], etc. Oscar only gets about a 2\" increase on his vertical, Westbrook loses about 2\" without the outlier respective to their generations kick in. My guess is Oscar gets a bigger boost than 2\" and Westbrook, even in a generation where many jump very well, still gets an increase vs a decrease. But to sum it up. Oscar is 6'7 255 lbs in 2017. Oscar shoots 55% FG and 90.5% FT. If I remember right, his projected annual 3PT% would be 36\u201342% annually. Westbrook is 6'1 185 lbs in 1962. His FG% is 38%, his FT% is 87.5%. I won\u2019t give you the rate statistics for PPG, RPG, APG as before\u200a\u2014\u200anot sure you\u2019d believe them any more now. This is all without factoring in these environmental changes. I think they\u2019re pretty hard to prove. But, as you can see, if we did factor in the physical things, they would be way more beneficial to Oscar than they would to Russell.
