{"content": "So, what is the \u201ca lot\u201d that choosing one or the other says about you? Are you arguing that choosing Harden means you\u2019re not fooled by the slight statistical advantage that Westbrook has by being surrounded by worse talent? Most of the article points out what I think is the objective truth\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re both incredible players having incredible seasons, and both are playing at MVP levels (along with Kawhi and LBJ). If Westbrook is surrounded by a worse supporting cast and has slightly better totals as a result, doesn\u2019t that simply equalize them? I totally agree this is an incredibly tight race\u200a\u2014\u200abut that fact leads me to think there are totally valid reasons to select any of the 2, if not 3\u20134. The more interesting angle to me, is if someone takes a hard stance on saying it\u2019s definitively one or the other. I think that says more about you as a fan than what your final selection is.
