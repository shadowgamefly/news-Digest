{"name": "730_15", "child": "", "content": "Hey, Ted! I\u2019m not against redesigns(I\u2019ve mentioned also the example of good redesign)\u00a0:) I just want to focus people on few things like you can get real experience instead of redesign some popular servicesyou can get new contacts working on real projectsyou can get new contacts working on real projectsreal project will get for you real feedbacks from customers/ownerspopular services already have designers and money, so better to help someone who dont\u2019have itdon\u2019t be so optimistic thinking that you are professional if you have likes of your redesigns at Dribble Offensive style of the first part of the article here just to force people to pay attention to some problems we have in the designers community. Let\u2019s imagine you are a new designer, you was creative, you know what\u2019s colors in trend right now and you created a redesign of Facebook, and also you want to get a feedback from professionals but no, you will get only \u201cCool, Awesome\u201d, because everyone will be kind to you. As a result\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will continue to do similar mistakes. Then your work will be published at Muzli for example, you will start to think that you are really good professional(but it\u2019s again not true), then probably you will be hired by company who will decide that you are really cool because you have 100500 likes at Dribble, but you still not a professional and you probably fail UI/UX of that project. My idea is to dispel these misconceptions. So please don\u2019t think that I\u2019m against this kind of job, I\u2019m just trying to provide for people information about how to make a deal with redesigns and what could be the right way.
