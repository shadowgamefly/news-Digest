BTW, I stopped using OTA and aggregator years ago. Even when they offer a better deal, it is never more than 5\u201310% less than the what you would spend buying directly from the airline, but then if there is any trouble, and there is always some trouble when you don\u2019t book directly, you have to pass hours on the phone with their costumer care to solve them. I prefer to spend a bit more and save myself the hassle\u2026 ", "title": "", "parent": "425", "creatorid": "e83c4e95adbc", "id": "d91bb68d6bc1"}
