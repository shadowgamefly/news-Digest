{"name": "593_24", "child": "", "content": "For me there are many things that stand out as evidence that Apple is suffering from an extreme case of hubris, but particularly telling are: Watch Jobs introducing the iPhone or the iPad, or better yet the MacBook Air. He\u2019s genuinely excited about the product, about how it\u2019s going to change your life, for the better. Now watch the MacBook Pro launch. The execs are proud of it being thinner and lighter and how revolutionary the TouchBar is, but they don\u2019t seem to care for the product as a whole, just how some facets of it demonstrate how clever they are.\u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d. Not so much that the book exists, but that Apple released it while the furore (warranted or not) over the MacBook Pro was in full force.That everything they do now requires elaborate engineering that they\u2019ve invented new techniques for. Even the book needed them to invent new inks and printing techniques, because no-one in the 600-odd year history of printing has ever been as clever as them.That the engineering, and their cleverness, is more important than the device. Sure, Jobs used to tout the advances that they\u2019d made to allow Apple to fabricate a product, but it was the product itself that was the most important thing, that was the star of the show. Now we\u2019re subjected to engineering porn as Ives tells us how clever Apple are at making things. Things that, year on year, seem to serve the customer less and Apple\u2019s ego more.
