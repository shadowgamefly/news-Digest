{"name": "728_24", "child": "", "content": "I get it; you want a quick way to build the CSS visually. I would say, though, that if you\u2019re exporting CSS straight out of Sketch to be implemented in a project you\u2019re going to be implementing bloated, non-DRY code. How about treating visuals as a guide to your design \u2013 since that\u2019s what they are \u2013 and using any additional resource available (CSS exporting, Zeplin, Invision Inspect) as tools to support that guide, ready for writing your Sass (who write vanilla CSS these days?!) in a logical, DRY, production-ready way. I for one would rather the Sketch team focussed on making a stable, safe-to-use product \u2013 in a working environment, upgrading Sketch is a no-go for at least 4\u20136 weeks after a launch \u2013 than adding a feature which can be implemented in other ways since it is only creating a visual treatment anyway.
