In my first startup we weren\u2019t organized, will was low and one co-founder wasn\u2019t giving his maximum so 2 of us suffered. In another startup I worked for, we had nice team, but organization was bad and CEO wasn\u2019t respecting us at all, saying: you are necessary evil, a means to an end. The most important thing is to find very good business partners, who are willing to sacrifice and be very motivated at all times, good and bad.
