This is beyond useless information and crosses over into irresponsible. To suggest this survey should be the basis of anyone\u2019s decisions\u2014especially those starting out careers in tech and programming\u2014is downright unethical. The survey results we all need to see is one that we will never see because the engineers worth following DO NOT ANSWER SURVEYS. I will stick with direct connections with businesses and groups of respectable, employed engineers and informally drawing conclusions from them over a beer or their extremely rare tweets or conference discussions over this bogus information any day. Based on the logic of this post we should all eat at McDonald\u2019s because they have served over 4 billion people. I suppose we can all use this as a perfect example of confirmation bias when considering actual statistical analysis that matters. I just recommended FreeCodeCamp to an adult getting back into tech after retirement yesterday and this single post has seriously given me pause about any further recommendations.
