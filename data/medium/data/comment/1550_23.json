{"name": "1550_23", "child": "", "content": "America was not designed to be a one party country. The last time this happened we had a Civil War. Republicans by trying to turn us into a one party country are doing themselves a disfavor because all they are doing are creating more people who don\u2019t want to conform to the one party or people who will decide that one party\u2019s ideology is not for them. After all, that is essentially what is happening in the Middle east isn\u2019t it? The Radical Islamist Muslims are trying to force all Muslims into their mold and if they succeed they would become the most dangerous group on Earth. That is why America and Nato and various nations are fighting in the Middle east isn\u2019t it? Yet at the same time, republicans are fighting to make us a one party country living under and eventually being forced to live under their rules? THis country seems to be running on hypocrisy more and more. And world leaders (except Putin of course!) but especially Europeans who have experienced and know what dictatorships look like are keeping their eyes on on an America who has elected trump. Because they know that once a dictator has conquered his own country, that same dictator will cast his eyes on other countries much like Putin has.
