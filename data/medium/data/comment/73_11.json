{"name": "73_11", "child": "", "content": "It\u2019s laughable to call the posse comment nasty. I cannot comprehend how you interpret it that way. There is a huge disconnect between the way the media has reacted to this story and everyone else. The Ringer, The Jump, and others have criticized Phil and have supported Lebron\u2019s notion that the comments were offensive and racially motivated. The large majority of regular people, who have this quality called common sense have cited this story as just another example of hypersensitivity. And the fact that the media isn\u2019t calling out Maverick Carter for looking at the antiquated definition of posse instead of the intended informal version(a group of people who have a common characteristic, occupation, or purpose) is flat out embarrassing. This kind of language policing is partly why Trump won but you guys still don\u2019t get that fact. Suggesting that using the word posse is offensive is a joke to rational, normal people who aren\u2019t warped by the politically correct movement.
