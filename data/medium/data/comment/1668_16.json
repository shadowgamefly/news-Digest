Did I mention that it\u2019s a game I really like?. Anyway, I\u2019m very impressed and inspired by your post and I thought, man\u2026 I could perhaps make or rather build and play it, I\u2019m not a gammer but this paticular game is one I can play hours on end with no problem. Unfortunately I\u2019m very new to programming, and every concerpt you mentioned above is somewhat gebrish.\u00a0:( What would you recommend I learn so I could be ready to hangle something like that? I just know HTML & CSS. ", "title": "", "parent": "1668", "creatorid": "63f81207583a", "id": "7a44a9c8e43c"}
