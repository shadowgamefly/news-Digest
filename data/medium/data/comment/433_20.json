{"name": "433_20", "child": "", "content": "One of the things I am most consistently surprised (or perhaps just disappointed) by in these relentless and unending reports of discrimination in the tech industry is how HR teams appear, repeatedly, to be powerless, and to enable the discriminatory behaviour. I know many passionate and brilliant HR professionals and have a tremendous respect for them and the work they do. I suspect the people in HR who enable, foster and feed discriminatory workplaces are not terrible people\u200a\u2014\u200abut they do have a terrible decision to make: Do the Right Thing or Lose Their Job. Part of the systemic problem we face is that HR isn\u2019t empowered sufficiently making it safe for them to do the right thing. HR isn\u2019t a proxy for Management. They are there to build and sustain the culture of an organization and to protect every single team member. Being a \u201chigh-performer\u201d MUST INCLUDE being a great leader and building-up your team, one person at a time. It can never be an excuse for covering for discrimination or any other behaviour that violates the missions, values and culture of an organization.
