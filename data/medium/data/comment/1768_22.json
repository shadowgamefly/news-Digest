There are some who spoke to this (a couple are even alive and famous today), and proposed ways of compensating for it (there is no known solution). The idea that keeps recurring is antifragility. The version (applied to judicial process) I remember best is from Herbert\u2019s \u201cThe Dosadi Experiment\u201d (1977). Other discussions I\u2019ve read are in economics (Hayek, Bastiat, Taleb, etc.). All are concerned with resilience, first, last, and always. The proposed workarounds are unsympathetic to the players, in some cases verging on barbarity. Humanism does not enter materially into any of these system designs. Resilient biological organisms have redundancy, as do all antifragile systems. Unfortunately, most redundancy has come to be viewed as unnecessary overhead. The human drive for efficiency and optimisation continuously trumps the importance of resilience. Thus why \u201clean\u201d manufacturing is so incredibly vulnerable to logistical disruptions. As a species, we come to solutions through (often highly destructive) trial and error. It\u2019s a very evolutionary process. Somewhere, that bastard Darwin is smiling.
