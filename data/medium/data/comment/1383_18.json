Except your blatant and outright display of agreeing to the power that wants all of not just your possessions yet also your mind and soul and spirit. you believe by writing such absurd rhetoric that you can have a part of the big picture. YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE BIG PICTURE. YOU ARE GIVING IN TO YOUR SELFISH AMBITIONS THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE IN COMMON AND THAT REALITY FOR YOU WILL BE SOON COMING ", "title": "", "parent": "1383", "creatorid": "c64937a11e", "id": "5752b64994d0"}
