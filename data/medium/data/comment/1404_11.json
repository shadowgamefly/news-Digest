{"name": "1404_11", "child": "", "content": "Thanks for this article, Rahaf! I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ve always been someone who loves to be part of a tribe. As a community manager I thus focus on creating a tribe. The community I\u2019m responsible for now discusses a highly intimate subject (sexuality) but I\u2019ve witnessed different types of behaviour by members. We have the typical tribe members but also others members who only sign up to ask a question or look at some pictures and then disappear. They usually don\u2019t put as much thought into filling out their profiles as the tribe members do, also their postings are usually much shorter. I struggle to explain to my tribe members why we don\u2019t ban the typical eco-system or single-serving members from participating in our community. I\u2019d love to exchange experiences with other community managers who have had to bridge the same gap between different member types in their communities.
