{"name": "601_4", "child": "", "content": "This is the one of the best and toughest lesson one learn as founder. If you don\u2019t tune with your co-founder well and ignore all the signals that you don\u2019t work well/ miss red flags. Then you are just being inefficient dragging along. Startup\u2019s are tricky business, There is no cookbook recipe. If there is one, it has to be your gut feeling: Never loose sight of it.  Lot of serial entrepreneur talk\u2019s about perseverance and how that\u2019s the most important ingredient of a successful startup. At the core i also believe that it\u2019s the biggest factor between success and failure. But perseverance is not the only factor. This was one of the reason, i was investing energy, time and sweat in a startup. Where every time my gut feeling said, out team doesn\u2019t work well together. But perseverance is not the only one factor!!!!! Startup\u2019s are tough fair enough!!! But if they are not making you happy every single moment be it success or failure. Then it\u2019s time to re-evaluate basics. I think cash crunch, bad customer retention though they are issue your startup is facing, still they give sense of purpose to fix them. If there is stagnation, wavelength issues\u00a0, no active discussion on daily basic, energy level which gives you high everyday then perseverance/ Money is not going to help you. Think & Win!!!!!
