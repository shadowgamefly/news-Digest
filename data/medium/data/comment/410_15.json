{"name": "410_15", "child": "", "content": "The most important standard isn\u2019t style; it\u2019s consistency. Whatever style standard you choose for a codebase, it\u2019s important that new additions are consistent with that style. What drives me up the wall isn\u2019t a coding style that is different from my own, but rather a codebase which adhered to absolutely no specific style throughout, even within the same file. Look, if you\u2019re going to use tabs, be consistent, and use tabs everywhere. If you\u2019re going to use spaces, use them everywhere. The same goes for spacing around parentheses, brace positioning, variable naming, etc. The files which have a mixture of multiple styles are the ones that drive even non-pedantic programmers up the wall. And the reason for this is simple: mixed styles make the code extremely difficult to read and sometimes difficult to debug. How many times have you sat there trying to figure out a weird bug, only to find out it was caused by a miscapitalized variable name or an assumption based upon badly indented code?
