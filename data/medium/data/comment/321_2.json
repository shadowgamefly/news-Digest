{"name": "321_2", "child": "", "content": "Okay I have one thing that it keeps beeping here inside when I hear rules. Having rules and/or adding more rules to your life besides all that you are living with, makes you more like a robot. You are very very far from that, but the fact is fact. The more algorithm you have the more you will become a droid. Instead I would prefer to setup goal(s). And on the way to make it you can decide if the goal worth to invest time and create rules to reach it. So rules are fine, but only if there is a goal for that. Otherwise you will just create \u201ca\u201d program. Yourself. ", "title": "", "parent": "321", "creatorid": "37eb863c44b4", "id": "c2c1f8c3d128"}
