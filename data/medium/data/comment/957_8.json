{"name": "957_8", "child": "", "content": "I\u2019m almost 66yrs old and have marched, knocked on doors, mailed flyers, contributed time, money and effort to a number of candidates and issues I\u2019ve been passionate about over the years. We won some, we lost some, we inched forward, never fast enough, never far enough. And yes, it was always disappointing & frustrating to see the light come on in the eyes of so many\u00a0\u2026 AFTER the fact. But, you don\u2019t slam the door in their face, you take the support you can get, when you can get it and move forward, perhaps a little more cynical, definitely wiser, but hopefully not so jaded that you give up or shut down, stop listening or stop caring.
