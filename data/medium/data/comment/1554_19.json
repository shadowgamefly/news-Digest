{"name": "1554_19", "child": "", "content": "Who of the commenters has ever lived in a black majority city? A city where all the positions of power are held by black people. Whether elected or appointed, not by virtue of personal merits or qualifications, but merely because of racial choices. Choices forced by archaic and antiquated laws like Affirmative Action or just because of fear of shakedown by black political and other interest groups. Blacks, not all, but the majority, rally behind any black individual that decries injustice without verifying the truthfulness of any claim. Come to cities like Saint Louis, Detroit, Baltimore, and many others like these ones, and live at your expenses the sad experience of being a middle aged white person and experience the real racism that these individuals are capable of. The same individuals that blindly rally behind any thug screaming racism ( see Ferguson, MO) and turn around and join their power to knowingly crush any other race! Unfortunately I live in this city and fight every day against the hypocrisy of the screaming black groups of power, the most relevant of which is Urban League!
