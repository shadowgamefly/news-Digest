{"name": "1512_2", "child": "", "content": "Stop being so selfish. Being white, straight, and healthy is irrelevant here. The real privilege you have is the one that lets you say \u201cmen should do things for me because of how I feel\u201d with any kind of straight face. How many people get to cherrypick from their subjective, personal experiences and then demand reality conforms to that? You don\u2019t seek to understand or even find out who your ideological opponents are or why they believe the things they do because you don\u2019t have to. That\u2019s class, social, political, and even legal privilege. And a lot of those opponents are women. A lot of them are not white. Do you think the patriarchy brainwashed them so they experiences are not valid? Why do you think your personal beliefs are universal to all women? That state congressman suffers from a delusion that\u2019s currently in outbreak status in Republican circles: an utter distrust of women. Unlike feminists, who distrust both women and men that don\u2019t think like them? First, that \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d is a false label. These are human issues No, they are feminist issues. Second, that the overwhelmingly male executive branch of our government is currently waging a war on women Which demographic comprises the majority of the electorate? Are you saying women are waging a war on women? Lastly, that the resistance to Tr*mp\u2019s white-dude coalition needs male ally-warriors for the counter-attack. Fantasy novels are called \u201cfantasy\u201d for a reason. The real, adult war is a bit more nuanced than total good vs. total evil. Because the way many Republicans currently in office would have it is for women to have a simple choice: either abstain from sex or put your health, your ambitions, and your plans on the line, because if you get pregnant, tough luck. And that\u2019s not a choice at all. You mean the same exact choice men have to make? I have yet to personally meet a man who has stated that he is against abortion. But I\u2019ve met several women who are. By the way, that riddle? You\u2019re right in that its old. The first time I heard it was before 2010 in high school. It took me about three seconds to solve the first time. ", "title": "", "parent": "1512", "creatorid": "99878d9f0eb8", "id": "e156e1087569"}
