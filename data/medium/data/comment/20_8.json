{"id": "deb205075cc5", "content": "Why didn\u2019t this so-called \u201cjournalist\u201d cover Obama\u2019s administration with this same zeal? Or how about investigating Hillary Clinton and the \u201cpay for play\u201d deals she made, or the Clinton Foundation\u2019s involvement in laundering Russian money while Hillary gave the Russians twenty percent of all US uranium ore while Secretary of State? This so-called \u201cjournalist\u201d thinks that, because money was sitting in the Trump Foundation, that it wasn\u2019t \u201cspent.\u201d Of course it was spent! I consider my donations to the Salvation Army to be \u201cspent, whether it is actually used right away, earmarked for a specific future purpose, or is \u201cjust sitting there\u201d in a bank account. I certainly don\u2019t have possession of the money anymore, nor any say in how it will be used. Neither did Trump. The effort of this so-called \u201cjournalist\u201d wasn\u2019t journalism; it was strictly to \u201cget Trump,\u201d and he just knew he\u2019d got him. He didn\u2019t. Trump\u2019s money was legal, and was legally spent. Invest this same effort on a Hillary investigation and you\u2019ll uncover not only improprieties but outright illegalities, and either get a Pulitzer or end up on the Clinton Death List.
