{"id": "dec25936daf5", "content": "Interesting article. I\u2019d love to know more about the visualisations data engineers produce (could you share some examples in a new post?), what tools are used to produce them and what science/best practices are followed to ensure they are effective. Engineers who claim to be able to create visualisations and analytics tools for other users blurs the line with data/analytics-product designers\u200a\u2014\u200aso do you feel there is a gap between data engineers and designers? If so, should product designers working on analytics try to learn some elements of data engineering in your view? Perhaps you view the development of analytics tools as purely an engineering problem? It\u2019s difficult to tell but would be great to understand your view on this further\u00a0:) ", "creatorid": "81661e1b84ca", "title": "", "parent": "116", "child": "", "name": "116_6"}
