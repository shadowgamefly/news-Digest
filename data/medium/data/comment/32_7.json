{"content": "As many other posters have already said, why is James Harden the probably MVP? I think it is a two way race but the obvious lead must and should go to Westbrook. Leonard is great, but he isnt putting up historic numbers while both harden and especially westbrook are. The only plus Harden has over Westbrook is that his team is simply better. He has better shooters and a perfect coach for the system. The drop of Harden on and off are not close to as significant to that of Westbrook. OKC would be a team battling for the first overall pick without him on it. ", "child": "", "parent": "32", "title": "", "creatorid": "22ad4a0bd7d7", "name": "32_7", "id": "8ff192f1195d"}
