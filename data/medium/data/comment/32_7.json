Westbrook is a TD machine and it is impressive but less so once you realise how he achieves those triple doubles. Meanwhile we have candidates from other top teams who play extraordinarly efficient game: Lebron, Kawhi, Thomas and Curry (who imho sneaked into the conversation with his play lately\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019s been the leader of the best team in the league, he is deadly efficient (even tough it\u2019s his worst season as far as efficiency goes), is always the main focus of opponents defense even without the ball, is actually a great underestimated team-defender (he is just too small to be great 1-on-1 defender although he is still better than Thomas) and his stats are on par with his 1st MVP season. If Curry played with the same mindset and freedom that Westbrook has I honestly believe he would average 40 points per game and would one day drain like 25 3-pointers in one game. I mean I would rather have Curry (arguably the best team player in the league with the way he sacrifices his game), whose mere presence alters the whole playing field instead of Westbrook running amok.
