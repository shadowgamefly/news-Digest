{"name": "1562_4", "child": "", "content": "So\u2026.in other words, standard operating procedure for the republican party. What would be hilarious is anyone acting at all surprised by this. The republican party and all its membership are concerned with one thing\u2026power\u2026and are willing to do anything to get it and maintain it. That includes colluding with Putin and his Russian mafia. That said, I\u2019m guessing that many republican senators really are sorry they had to do this\u2026sorry because they know that, as republicans, they were using the filibuster to hold up the appointment of judges much more than Democrats. Over the last 30 years, republicans used the filibuster much more, and now, they won\u2019t be able to. So, don\u2019t be surprised if the next time the Democrats are about to gain control of the senate, the republicans use the lame duck session to reinstitute filibuster for all judges\u2026and do it with a straight face, because that\u2019s just who they are.
