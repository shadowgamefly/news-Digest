I use softer phrases and tones most of the time. It is situational. I most recently fell off the wagon in my own home. I would expect that I had a buildup and just let the F word out of my mouth over and over again, purging the thought. I do not throw words away. I move words further back in my storage unit. I have a very hard time not thinking them at all as they are a part of my vocabulary. I have a lot of choice words built up. It felt very freeing to let it go. Better it was in my home with no one around. Being beaten, punished and manipulated into silence has not stopped cussing or expressing feelings. As a child we learn it somewhere and once the words are heard they are a part of our thought vocabulary. Habits are hard to break. I still rebel in thought. I am by no means a master of myself, but continue to attempt to make the improvements. I attempt to look at the things I have overcome as a way to not give up or completely give in. I am also back to drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and not eating the right foods. I recently had too many big changes in my life going on at once and tanked in these areas. I have however done better in the tit for tat of my responses. Not responding at all is very difficult for me. I am still thinking the thoughts of one upping comments in return when any unkind word or label is being placed upon me. I will keep working on it one thing at a time. Trying to un speak is a whole new language for me. \ufffdJ\ufffdY\ufffd\ufffd ", "creatorid": "48eeb4a1bea9", "title": "", "parent": "58", "child": "", "name": "58_23"}
