Everyone has ID, you can\u2019t open a bank account for the mandatory direct deposited benefits and SSI and welfare unless you have Government issued ID. It is Federal law. You can\u2019t cash a check, rent a car, get insurance, or use your new Obamacare policy unless you show Government issues ID. So Liberals are claiming only loyal Liberal voters never have ID? So that means loyal Liberals never have a job and never will? You can\u2019t work unless you fill out an I-9 with your employer, guess what you have to have to fill out that I-9?
