I have been through hell with my last relationship. I was like losing my grip. But I am glad I can move on. Then, \u201cYou\u2019re different person than you were last year\u201d. I think I have experienced that. I think I have learned and observed many things from my past. The two more points that relate to me are \u201cYou\u2019ve achieved something worthwhile\u201d for most of the time I felt I have done nothing in life because my reference of a success is beyond my reach or when my friends mentioned this and that that I have never done, I felt like I failed. But, you reminded me that actually I have achieved several things in my life that made me proud of myself. The last is, \u201cYou have the strenght to be happy\u201d. I believe happiness is made by ourselves not depends on others. So, yes\u2026I can be happy. I have just opened my medium again for I didn\u2019t take the bus last week, so I missed my reading time, including your response. Glad, I can reply your response now.
