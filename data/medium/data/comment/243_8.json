{"name": "243_8", "child": "", "content": "There\u2019s no reasonable way to use injury designation as a means of protecting against these situations. Teams can and will find a way to skirt those rules, or invent nagging injuries. And a fine by the league does nothing for those most impacted by these decisions, the fans. If the NBA really wants to focus on those most impacted, they would implement a rule that would require teams to compensate fans impacted by these situations. In other words, if say two of the top players on the team are benched for a non-injury or non-emergency situation, the fans who had a valid ticket for that night would be entitled to a future ticket of their choosing in a comparable section. You can use whatever metric makes sense for \u201ctop\u201d player (highest salaries on the team, best PER, number of jerseys sold, etc). The point is that teams will think twice about the impact of their decisions if they would have to potentially forego future revenue and negatively impact their own fans. I\u2019m sure there are some issues with that proposal, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable place to start.
