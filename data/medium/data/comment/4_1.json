{"id": "ed6885d66fa2", "content": "Experiencing self vs remembering self, is an excellent framework from Daniel Kahneman. It highlights, the actual experience and what we may remember from that experience in future. I highly recommend reading it, it opened my eyes, on how to look at \u201chappiness\u201d! Also, Buddha\u2019s saying, \u201cattachment is the root of suffering\u201d, hard to deal with, given that capitalism rules the world! We are bombarded with, craving for more things! Given the complexity of genetics, wiring of the our brain, culture and environment, and not knowing what is the purpose of our life in this planet, for me, it is hard to fake happiness! unless, you numb your brain, believe in a fictional story (any religion), and live in a la la land.
