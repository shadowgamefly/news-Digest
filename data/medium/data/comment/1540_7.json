{"name": "1540_7", "child": "", "content": "It grows unceasingly clear from the geometric progression of, and the sort of lies being told by (and for) Trump, that for his Hail Mary play he is counting on ultimate support from those people that have something most of America lacks: hatred so blinding (racial and otherwise) as to create a obedience to absolute ignorance beyond our grasp to comprehend. And what is the result of that hatred, bottled for eight years (and even fifty?) Violence. We\u2019ve seen countless instances since the election (and even as was daily encouraged by Trump from early in the campaign.) For many of these dangerous people, what Trump offered wasn\u2019t jobs, or \u201cgreatness for America\u201d. Many millions saw Trump as an outlet for their violent hatred. And if a man as insane as Trump sees his power diminishing, is there really any question what extreme measures he\u2019ll undertake to maintain his control, not over humanity, but over planet Earth itself? These people have spent a lifetime creating sex-fueled control fantasies of exactly the same sort Trump has. Trump\u2019s involves fame. Theirs involves guns. Many, many guns. As we saw in Uganda, when violence begins, humanity falls by the wayside. We must all continue to work for a peaceful solution. I suspect even trolls don\u2019t hate liberals as much as they would despise being controlled by nazis and fascists. (I\u2019m pretty sure skinheads won\u2019t offer healthcare\u2026.but then neither do republicans.) ", "title": "", "parent": "1540", "creatorid": "7da26a3244a7", "id": "48481f334378"}
