{"name": "1885_4", "child": "", "content": "By all means, apply to Y Combinator. Its not that hard to do and you don\u2019t have anything to lose. We at nderground applied to Y Combinator and didn\u2019t get in. Getting into Y Combinator is about twice as hard, statistically, as getting into an Ivy League school. Just to set expectations. What Y Combinator delivers, more than anything else, is a path to venture capital funding. nderground has not followed this path and I think that this might be a good thing. There is a huge amount of pressure for quick results once you accept venture capital money. It can take a long time to build a social network and a group of users. Not all applications worth building go viral. Venture capital is often based on a grow explosively or die approach to companies. This doesn\u2019t always happen. It is very difficult to tell whether something will go viral until it does. ", "title": "", "parent": "1885", "creatorid": "7093ff1752fc", "id": "6aeb7a5482fe"}
