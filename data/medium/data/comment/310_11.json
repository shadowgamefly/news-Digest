You made a point saying that \u201cping-pong-email-conversations\u201d should be avoided by taking your time and communicating in a structured (content PLUS format) way. Otherwise (my) 10 \u2013 30 business emails a day could amount to 100+ emails a day\u2026 However the style of writing also depends on your messages\u2019 recipients- for a hedge funds mngr having to read more than \u201ccall tmrrw 6pm rgrds to xy portfolio?\u201d could be seen as waste of time- the same message could be the last one to a corporate\u2019s procurement manager\u2026 I hope a got my point across;) Thanks for the article!
