I\u2019m bad at fights and I get super sad when people get hurt, even if one or all of them are awful shits, but especially when none of them are and everything used to be supportive and constructive like five minutes ago. I get stressed and I don\u2019t get over the loss and then I can\u2019t sleep (more so than usual).You\u2019re most definitely one of my special peeps on here. My Medium experience so far has truly hinged on the monumental efforts of a handful of amazing souls (and counting!!! There are so many wonderful people here) and you are one of them. I\u2019m grateful for it every damn day. ", "child": "", "id": "e42b30156cd5", "title": ""}
