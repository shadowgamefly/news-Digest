{"name": "551_2", "child": "", "content": "Life is not bad. I am just very sad and do not know how to get past it. I believe between my mom, my sister, my grandson, and my home\u2026 there\u2019s been no closure and may never be. I need to make myself happy. Thank you for this moment-it feels good right now. That was me earlier. My Google was signed into my alter ego that writes even less than I write. Anyway, thank you Tessa for including me. I have been awfully depressed. My heart wants to be home in Hawaii and I\u2019m not sure I get to go back because I have a very special grandson and when he went into a coma two years ago, it took me more than 24 hours to get to him and my then 18 year old daughter. I was there over a month after spending two and a half months in Nevada helping my mom pass. Anyway, I am \u201cstuck\u201d in SoCal, which I used to love, but everyday I do not wake up and think how beautiful it is here and it hurts so bad. My last daughter moved from Hawaii to Oregon last month\u2026 and it makes me feel like I will need to be rich to go back so I can afford to go back and forth. And that\u2019s just one thing making me sad, this is an entire book; I\u2019m off to read your rambling now that I have rambled myself.
