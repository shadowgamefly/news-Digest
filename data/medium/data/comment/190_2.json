{"name": "190_2", "child": "", "content": "I generally tend to avoid commenting on these kind of posts ( I mean, personal\u2026 with creativity issues\u2026 mainly because these kind of issues are personal- and the solutions generally tend to be individual- what works for me will never work for you, and vice versa\u2026) )\u00a0\u2026 but, every now and then- there is a text that resonates with me and my experiences and above anything else, I see an issue I can actually help with Yours is one them I am not too certain why, but I think it is mainly because, unlike with the vast majority of people posting stuff, you seem to be genuinely interested in creating (writing) something meaningful- from what I have seen you do not seem to be one of those characters that are putting stuff out there looking for some sort of validation or a large number of likes and hits\u2026.\u00a0\u2026 if you are anything like me (and you seem to be\u200a\u2014\u200aa lot) than, you have had that need ( not desire, need) to express (create) for the sake of creation- nothing else\u2026 and that ( together with the idea of perfectionism- (which I am very familiar with) is a big part of your problem\u2026 If I may\u00a0\u2026 you wrote\u00a0: \u201c I took a conventional path to success and lost parts of myself along the way. My hypothesis (my hope, really) is that re-awakening my creativity will help me rediscover myself and figure out what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d I understand what you are talking about when you say that choosing a conventional path to success has made you loose parts of yourself and your creativity\u2026. a lot of us were faced with the same thing at some point\u2026 I have seen many, many people who were taken by the momentary idea of what it means to be successful ( on which I fortunately never truly subscribed)\u00a0\u2026 and\u00a0, a decade or two later, they figured out that while they were looking for that success idea (which was never theirs to begin with)\u00a0.. they lost contact with the person they were when they started looking\u2026. Some made it back\u2026 others never did- just like with anything else- it then depends on the person but, one thing that doesn\u2019t vary is the approach\u2026.. you see, you say that re-awakening your creativity might help you re-discover the creative person that god hidden away (she is still there do not worry- the fact that you are even thinking about these things shows that she\u00a0, although weak, is still not dead)\u00a0\u2026 but that is simply wrong. Trying to do that will make you feel even worse, and you will not get your creativity back What you need to do is the opposite\u2026. you need to find \u201cthat person\u201d who was creative\u2026 and the writing will come, you will hear you voice. You see, despite of what we would like to believe, our creativity depends a lot on our emotional state\u2026 and more often than not, the worse off we are, the better we write\u2026..An excellent description of the entire subject can be found in a movie Barfly (if you do not like reading Bukowski)\u2026. I do not remember the scrip word by word- it has been years since I have seen it- but there a scene in which Rourke says that \u201cnobody who could write worth a damn could ever write in peace\u201d\u2026.. and there is nothing more truer than that\u2026\u00a0I am not saying that now you should go back to your student days, give up your job, get evicted and then try to write\u2026 but, if you need to break a cycle, get off the \u201cwriters block\u201d\u2026. ( I hate the expression)\u2026. get out of your comfort zone\u2026. do something new, risky, have something meaningful at stake\u2026.. and trust me\u2026. before you know it the words will be flowing our of your fingertips\u2026. it is not about hoping that by being creative again that person will show up\u2026. it was that person who was being creative- and the only way to re-awaken creativity is to re-awake the \u201cyou\u201d that was creative\u2026 ( And yes, we all have several; versions of ourselves\u2026 and through our lifetimes, we tend to develop quite a few)\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. I hope that what I am saying is making sense\u2026. Another thing\u2026. I am not 100% certain of this, but.. well, correct6 me if I am wrong\u2026. (again) I really understand the \u201cperfectionist\u201d part\u2026 I am one of those characters that is not satisfied until I am in a position to say \u201cThis is the best I can do\u201d\u00a0\u2026. and, as good as it is\u2026 it also creates limitations while creating. It took me a while to figure out how to make it work\u2026 It is actually quite easy\u2026 just, whatever it is that you are writing\u2026.. DO NOT STOP TO FIX ANYTHING\u2026 this is a critical part of the creation process, especially when working on the first and second draft\u2026. As you are probably well aware by now, once we start writing, get into our creative/mental space\u2026.the smallest intrusion breaks the connection. Am am certain you had those \u201cepisodes\u201d when you start writing something and the entire thing just keeps coming from out fo somewhere,the sentences appear in your head faster than you can type them\u2026. this is the point where most writers loose it\u2026. while working on those first couple of drafts\u2026 we can not afford to stop and check the syntax, spelling.. whatever. IF we do, we get out of that \u201czone\u201d and we never finish what we started- or, even if we do, it is far from what we thought it should be\u2026. so, although I know how hard it is\u00a0, simply ignore every mistake, typo or anything while you are creating\u00a0\u2026. just keep writing.. there is always time to fix the grammar, the syntax, the typos\u2026 everything can be fixed in the 3rd, 4th 5th\u2026 draft. But, if you loose that chain of thought which made you start writing.. everything else is useless\u2026 Do not try to \u201cfind\u201d your voice\u2026. it is there, just let it be heard\u2026. DO not stifle it by thinking about how it will sound, or (the worst mistake anyone dealing with creative work can do) or by comparing it with other voices, even the ones you like hearing- even the ones that have influenced you for your entire life\u2026 you are not them. what worked for them will not work for you. what I am saying is that it seems to me that you know very well what you are supposed to do\u00a0\u2026. so, simply do it\u2026. do not think about how good or bad it will end up being, will people like it, or even the correct spelling\u2026.. because, at the end of the day, the only audience you should be worried about is you\u2026 the moment you are happy with what you did- it is all OK. But of you are not happy with your work- all the praise in the world will not help you feel better about it (Of course.. I am writing all of this because, from what I have read, Igot an impression hat we have some very similar character traits\u2026 but, if I am wrong, and you are actually looking for cheap validations and a lot of clicks and likes.. then my advice is useless) so, just let your fingers do the writing, let the story run through you until it\u2019s end without even the smallest interruption, and, I promise, you will hear your voice louder and clearer than you ever though possible.
