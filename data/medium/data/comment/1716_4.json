Yes, Neuroplasticity is a wondeful way to assist with removing bad habits. Just make a list of everything that you would like to change like you have. Neuroscientists tell us that the best place to start is by learning to recognize the trigger for your habit, then begin to override and rewire neuro pathways of that habit by consciously and mindfully replacing the bad habit with a healthy one instead. The brain is extremely malleable and each time we replace a negative habit with a positive action it\u2019s like laying down a new groove in our minds, and the more we repeat the positive habit, the deeper the grove gets, until eventually over time we\u2019ll find that we\u2019ve truly changed the way our mind behaves. It\u2019s all about self discipline. You will get to a time and place that you will be unable to live with the negative habits anymore. Hope this helps you. Lots of Love, Marina ", "title": "", "parent": "1716", "creatorid": "3258ee8f7437", "id": "689ff8ed4723"}
