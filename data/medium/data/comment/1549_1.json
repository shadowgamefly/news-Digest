Look at Nixon\u2019s stand against his own marijuana commission. This commission\u2019s report said that marijuana posed no\u00a0. addiction and was benign next to alcohol. But Nixon ignored the report and re classified marijuana as a class 1 drug. John Ehrlichman wrote in his book, that Nixon did it to disenfranchise people of color and hippies. Then Reagan\u2019s policies put the voter suppression on steroids, with his war on drugs. All political with no bases in reality. Drug addiction should be handled by the Medical Community, not law enforcement. ", "title": "", "parent": "1549", "creatorid": "f47c012a2c84", "id": "5c0e04df4e78"}
