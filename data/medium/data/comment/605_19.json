{"name": "605_19", "child": "", "content": "Jason, Thanks for sharing your struggles. As a product developer, who is also a photography buff, I\u2019m happy to hear you weren\u2019t too close to the market fit problem to see it. As impressive as the technology is, using it to adjust focus on snap shots seemed like a party trick that would soon get old. Perhaps, I\u2019m old school, but I find that the best pictures are the result of time and attention when composing them. The same thing goes for developing products. Nice to hear your board was able to take the long view and see the value in the technology and team. Good luck following the new direction\u00a0\u2026 and continuing to keep a clear head if the new path needs refinement.
