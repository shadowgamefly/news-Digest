{"name": "1207_11", "child": "", "content": "Editor\u2019s pick, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Congrats, Rebecca! It\u2019s not only that you are a hell of a writer, but perhaps more to the point: the compassion you have in you shows through the words and it hits you in the face. It makes the reader feel part of the human race and this reader in particular feels connected to all women who, like me, suffer(ed) from depression. In my case the depression is caused by a lack of serotonin (chemical inbalance in the brain), which was solved by what I like to call my happy pills, that completely changed my life and made me the happy girl I once was. I advise all sufferers: go and get help! You are a walking example of how love and especially compassion can change the world. Fine illustration, too. I will share on Twitter.
