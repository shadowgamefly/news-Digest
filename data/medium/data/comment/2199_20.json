I\u2019m a freelancer \u2018solotrepeneur\u2019 (I love that btw) running my own business from home and I can definitely see where you are coming from with some of your points. However I find the lack of routine liberating in a way, and I feel a lot more at ease mentally. As long as you have the right mind for it (i.e. self-motivation and hatred for laziness) it\u2019s actually remarkably embracing to not have a daily grind. It encourages creativity and promotes independence. If you can succeed with no \u2018structure\u2019 to your day, then you can probably succeed in most circles of life. Anyway, thanks for the article Bianca, really enjoyed it! ", "name": "2199_20", "id": "4b40a053c91f"}
