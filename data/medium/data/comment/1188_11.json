The problem is we often don\u2019t know that we are entering toxic work environments until we get there. That is meant to be the function of the \u201cred flags\u201d I shared. I believe they signal bad work environments. These companies should have to work hard to be competitive in the talent marketplace. That means they need to work harder to be better more inclusive work environments for everyone. That being said we all have bills and sometimes we have to make concessions for opportunities that can propel us forward. So long as we are conscious of those concessions and have a plan for how long and how much we can stand then we are working the system. It\u2019s not working us.
