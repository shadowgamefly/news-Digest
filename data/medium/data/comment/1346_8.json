{"name": "1346_8", "child": "", "content": "I did a similar experiment when I was first trying out Medium. I posted a story without sharing it anywhere else and was shocked when I got hundreds of readers who actually engaged either through recommends or leaving notes. I honestly thought I would get zero, so hundreds was a big deal to me. My intent was to practice writing and not garner an audience, so I was impressed with how Medium was still able to find an audience for what I wrote just through it\u2019s own community. These days I mostly post to Medium without sharing anywhere else because I like the dynamics of the Medium community over others. I love the highlight feature because it tells me which parts of my post resonates the most. I love how people can respond to posts and how those are all linked together. It is truly a modern platform for the modern world and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve finally found a place that has somehow inspired me to actually write.
