{"name": "315_5", "child": "", "content": "Well it defines a lot of places where I have worked. They bring you in to make changes and then the very ones that hired you begin to tie you down. It\u2019s like some blind game that everyone is in on and you become the titled troublemaker and of course everyone steers clear of you. So this mission to implement change becomes a cat and mouse game until finally you call the corporate leader out on the carpet and usually he or she begins to play dumb and act as if you are making up all of this. What I have found is that sometimes it\u2019s best just to do your work and let others do whatever they choose to do. But whenever an opportunity comes along to bail out take it. Don\u2019t start thinking things will change because usually they won\u2019t. You can\u2019t implement change where no one wants to change and you can\u2019t save the ship while working in the boiler room because when it hits an iceberg you will surely be the very first one to drown and the others will make sure no one throws you a life line.
