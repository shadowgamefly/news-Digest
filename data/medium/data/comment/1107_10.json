{"name": "1107_10", "child": "", "content": "Two major problems with this article. First, written by a self-proclaimed gay atheist, there\u2019s no way a reasonable person could conclude everything in the article isn\u2019t bias. The average middle school student could read this tripe and realize the author wrongly assumes many issues in ways that support his own hate and lack of tolerance and respect. Second, and this is really a tangent issue to my first point, assuming that equality between unequal things is necessary or desirable is a joke. Same sex (pseudo) marriage IS NOT, and never can be, equal to real marriage between one man and one woman. Even the LGBT knows this obvious reality. Any argument to the contrary would necessarily require one also support bestial marriages, polygamy, NAMBLA and every other \u201calternate\u201d arrangement. To argue against the equal nature of these alternate choices under the guise of the typical harm and/or consent basis, is nothing more than a veiled attempt to establish and impose a superior moral position, which is exactly what the LGBT, this author and every other \u201cdain bramaged\u201d liberal whines about when they hypocritically attack anyone who dares to voice an opinion counter the the LGBT \u201chandbook!\u201d ", "title": "", "parent": "1107", "creatorid": "3620e9f5c0c8", "id": "be50e71cf8b3"}
