{"name": "594_5", "child": "", "content": "If the \u201cdisembodied voice\u201d can be more intelligent and can show those images up on any device, on any display, surely that\u2019s a greater end to aim for that one tied to a device and particular ecosystem? Alexa seems hugely promising. Of course we still want screens; we still want to take pictures and more, but, i\u2019m not going to ask Siri or Alexa to take a picture for me? So, a dedicated tool for that feels essential. Alexa is one thing for now, but it looks to be an intelligent assistant that can do many other things across devices; that\u2019s a goal worth aiming for.
