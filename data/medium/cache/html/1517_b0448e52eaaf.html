On Fulton Street in Bed-Stuy, it feels like someone or something has died, and the silence is so heavy that even the thick, solid brownstones seem to be sagging under its weight. The eyes I meet on the street are haggard, as if they’ve been up all night fighting some new and violent truth, and I feel just as bowled over by this truth as anyone else. It surprises me that my lack of faith in this country, its systems, and its flag have not insulated me more — that my cynicism has not done a better job of protecting me from this heartbreak.</p><p name="c843" id="c843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wonder how this day is being experienced by those on whom this nation’s brutalities have always laid more heavily — those who, perhaps, have always known America better than I. It’s not that I thought this place was what it claimed to be, but I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">did</em> think we were at a different stage in its history. It feels like waking up late at night on the subway home, realizing you’ve been on the wrong train all along. I wonder whether the trajectory of America has been abruptly altered, or merely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">revealed</em>. And today it occurs to me that <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlktempleisraelhollywood.htm" data-href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlktempleisraelhollywood.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">King’s arc of the moral universe</a> is indeed long, but perhaps it doesn’t bend toward justice at all, just bends.</p><blockquote name="cb2f" id="cb2f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">I wonder whether the trajectory of America has been abruptly altered, or merely <em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">revealed</em>.

Bush is president. The US has recently paid for a coup to overthrow a democratically elected government in Haiti. Before that, Afghanistan and Iraq, the Patriot Act and Extraordinary Rendition. On and on it goes, like some horrifying roller coaster you can’t get off. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">And the flags. </em>The flags are everywhere now,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>laying claim to every crack and crevice of public life: Street corners and cranes and front doors and windows. They have even made their way inside my own home, screaming out through the television screen.</p><p name="6604" id="6604" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of this transforms me. I find a pair of quirky, radical high school history teachers who take me under their wings, read Noam Chomsky and Malcolm X and Emma Goldman, and ultimately, I join the movement — specifically the anti-war movement. We march in the streets, shout at the top of our lungs, piss off our parents, and curse out our leaders. We are fierce, courageous, and earnest, but honestly, most of the time it feels like the war is a gigantic, lumbering elephant and we are mosquitoes, barely even cracking skin. We have some of the biggest demonstrations in world history,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> and hundreds of thousands of people die anyway</em>. It’s hard to describe the collective shame and helplessness that this kind of failure elicits in us, but I feel it in my body every day — in hardened eyes, slumped shoulders, an armored chest.</p><p name="3fcb" id="3fcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This country is doomed</em>, we think. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">These people are too far-gone</em>, we say. They call us anti-American, and in our defiance, we agree; we say that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">they can have their fucking America</em>. Even the word itself erases an entire continent to our south. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We don’t need it.</em> If America is Bush, the war machine, austerity, the prison system, bombs at abortion clinics and mosques, Guantanamo, and Halliburton, then we don’t want anything to do with it anyway. If America is genocide and slavery and empire, then it was never ours to begin with. Besides, we have visions of freedom that span beyond these borders.</p><p name="d3f1" id="d3f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sort of rejection seems like the only reasonable thing to do, the only way to make sense of history and the present; perhaps, even, it is the only way to survive this kind of loss. But for me, it is also the beginning of a long retreat.</p><p name="8711" id="8711" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stop paying attention to electoral politics, stop thinking of the state as an avenue for any sort of change, stop even wanting to intervene in it, much less reform it. I stop thinking about scale as a relevant factor in our organizing, stop talking politics with people who aren’t in the movement, stop even reading the news. I join a left that seems, every day, to drift further and further away from trying to build political power, away from attempting to win over the public, away from working class people, and deeper into a bubble of its own. We have our own organizations, our own publications, our own trainings, our own spaces, and no need for anyone else. We find belonging in lack of belonging, and it protects us.</p><p name="982e" id="982e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We do good work, learn important lessons, and have big dreams. But in the end, so many of those dreams remain our little secret, tucked safely away, out of sight to the rest of the world; and really, the rest of the world is out of sight to us too.</p><h4 name="776b" id="776b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Challenge</strong></h4><p name="bdaf" id="bdaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It’s the morning of February 3rd, 2017. I’m at my desk at home, in Brooklyn, sunlight creeping through the blinds on the window to my left. I’m hovering between work emails and Facebook, following the rabbit hole of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/yemen-bodega-brooklyn-immigration-ban/515670/" data-href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/yemen-bodega-brooklyn-immigration-ban/515670/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bodega Strike</a>, in which thousands of bodega owners and workers from across New York City — most of them Yemeni and Muslim — have gone on strike and gathered at Brooklyn’s Borough Hall to protest the immigration ban. The images show a jarring sea of brown people waving American flags. I watch the videos, and the deafening chants of “USA! USA!” vibrate through my speakers.</p><p name="3f01" id="3f01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The flags blind me. An old reflex jumps from my body, transporting me back to 2004, when this country suffocated me with its flags, and I snap my laptop shut. I am struck by the competing emotions surging through me — admiration, humility, inspiration, repulsion, confusion, shame.</p><p name="8354" id="8354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How can these people, of all people, find ownership, belonging, and even love in a place like this? Maybe they don’t get it, I think. Maybe they wave the flag for safety from those who speak most loudly in its name, act most violently on its behalf; perhaps this is what they think they have to do survive. Or maybe they really <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">do</em> love this place, even through the heartbreak. Or maybe they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> to love it, and their flag-waving is not a celebration of the vision of the founding fathers but a calling into existence of a dream not yet born.

What’s more, the right wing offensive underway will likely create even further instability — more deportations, more Black and brown people locked up, more debt, more unemployment, more pipelines on Indigenous land, more policies that hurt women and queer and trans folks, more impacts of climate change, more surveillance, more war.</p><p name="7d8a" id="7d8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can expect more crisis. But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity, and our opponents know this. In fact, as Naomi Klein’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Shock Doctrine</em> teaches us, crisis is part of their playbook.</p><p name="3c16" id="3c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For Trump, a deepening crisis is an opportunity to continue barreling forward as planned; after all, crisis has always been part of his narrative. He will blame it on his political enemies and those communities already under attack, and use it to expand his agenda. The rest of the Republican Party, the defense industry, and much of the business class, will likely go along with it, unless and until they think the ship is actually sinking. The white nationalists and other far right wingers coming out of the woodwork in droves will use it as an opportunity to keep pulling the whole political map in their direction; they now have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/turn-on-the-hate-steve-bannon-at-the-white-house.html?_r=1" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/turn-on-the-hate-steve-bannon-at-the-white-house.html?_r=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a man in the White House</a> to help them do it.</p><p name="d21d" id="d21d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For establishment Democrats — as well as for Republicans who defect if and when the instability deepens enough to effectively incapacitate the administration — the crisis will provide the opportunity to name Trump as the problem, while preserving business-as-usual. If we get rid of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">him</em>, they’ll tell us, everything can go back to normal. Normal<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>will be ushered in by corporate Democrats and “moderate” Republicans, protecting many of the same interests, featuring a reversal of only the most egregious elements of Trump’s policies, and keeping in tact the rest — much of which was already enshrined by the administrations that came before this one.</p><p name="5821" id="5821" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But as <a href="https://mic.com/articles/166720/blm-co-founder-protesting-isnt-about-who-can-be-the-most-radical-its-about-winning#.6n6pKF87u" data-href="https://mic.com/articles/166720/blm-co-founder-protesting-isnt-about-who-can-be-the-most-radical-its-about-winning#.6n6pKF87u" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alicia Garza</a>, <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/win-populist-times/" data-href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/win-populist-times/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Matthew Smucker</a>, <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/stop-trump-10-point-strategy/" data-href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/stop-trump-10-point-strategy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">George Lakey</a>, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/trump-black-lives-racism-sexism-anti-inauguration/" data-href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/trump-black-lives-racism-sexism-anti-inauguration/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Keeanga-Yahmatta Taylor</a>, and many other leaders and mentors are telling us, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this crisis is an opportunity for the Left too</em>.

It is an opportunity both to take the streets, and also take over real levers of power. It is our chance to reject both Trump’s white economic nationalism and the corporate Democrats’ multicultural neoliberalism — to bring to life a new kind of politic that combines racial, gender, and economic justice to unite the majority of the population against the elite. It is a chance to build a mass movement that has equity and solidarity at its core, that takes leadership from those impacted by the systems we’re fighting, that works for all of us.

I wonder how I can possibly hope to belong to a place like this, how I can identify with a dream that has caused so much pain to so many people. I know, also, that to be a popular movement, we will have to make a bold claim that this place belongs to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">us </em>instead of<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> them,</em> and I wonder if it’s really possible for me claim this place belongs to me, when everything I know here stands on land stolen from people who were murdered for its theft, where everything I touch was built with labor extracted from people brought there in chains, where so much of it is made of wealth taken from around the world at gunpoint. It occurs to me that it is a huge risk to identify with this place and its mythology, to be popular, to enter into struggle over the whole of this country, knowing that so many of the examples of populism before us watered down their politics to accommodate the ruling class, sold out their grand visions of tomorrow for partial gains of today, abandoned those most oppressed at the finish line. It feels dangerous to grow — to welcome into our movements the many people who are becoming politicized in these times — knowing that the greater pains and burdens of entering into the delicate and never-ending experiment of solidarity will fall on those already most impacted by the system. It strikes me, too, that it’s frightening to have the kind of hope a struggle like this demands. After all, where there is hope, there is also often heartbreak.</p><blockquote name="fcfb" id="fcfb" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">I wonder how I can possibly hope to belong to a place like this, how I can identify with a dream that has caused so much pain to so many people.</blockquote><p name="a251" id="a251" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">But I know, just as well, that our past failures are not inevitable. We can embrace the malleability of this place called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">America</em>, contest our enemy’s hegemony over its dreams, care about this country and this land and these people, while telling the truth about its brutal history and present, honoring the people who lived here before us, and seeing nationhood not as a barrier to internationalism, but a stepping stone towards it. We can join with the growing majority of people standing in opposition to Trump, while still going on the offensive against all of his enablers — the Republican Party whose agenda he is carrying forth, the huge corporate interests he has since installed into government, and also the Democratic Party establishment whose marriage to Wall Street helped create the conditions for this upheaval in the first place. We can be popular, and big, and speak in a language that the public understands, while bringing a critique of capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy into the mainstream, while holding up a vision for the world we can have if we fight for it, while saying words like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">single payer healthcare</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">universal basic income</em>, even <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">reparations</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">socialism</em>. We can grow our movements dramatically, invest deeply in the transformation of the millions of people looking for a political home in this moment, and build deeply across race, class, gender, and sexuality, while still demanding more from each other, while practicing solidarity and accountability with the wisdom to know that we will fail and try again and fail better if we keep trying.

It is a golden opportunity to finally translate our proven ability to shift the national discourse into a concrete capacity to actually achieve our own purpose — to move from having influence to having real power.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":7,"end":19,"href":"https://mic.com/articles/166720/blm-co-founder-protesting-isnt-about-who-can-be-the-most-radical-its-about-winning#.6n6pKF87u","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":21,"end":45,"href":"http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/win-populist-times/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":47,"end":59,"href":"http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/stop-trump-10-point-strategy/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":61,"end":84,"href":"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/trump-black-lives-racism-sexism-anti-inauguration/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":137,"end":183},{"type":2,"start":1015,"end":1038},{"type":2,"start":1061,"end":1070},{"type":2,"start":1086,"end":1091}]},{"name":"e8e8","type":1,"text":"This crisis is, in the end, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Left to lead.

I know, also, that to be a popular movement, we will have to make a bold claim that this place belongs to us instead of them, and I wonder if it’s really possible for me claim this place belongs to me, when everything I know here stands on land stolen from people who were murdered for its theft, where everything I touch was built with labor extracted from people brought there in chains, where so much of it is made of wealth taken from around the world at gunpoint. It occurs to me that it is a huge risk to identify with this place and its mythology, to be popular, to enter into struggle over the whole of this country, knowing that so many of the examples of populism before us watered down their politics to accommodate the ruling class, sold out their grand visions of tomorrow for partial gains of today, abandoned those most oppressed at the finish line. It feels dangerous to grow — to welcome into our movements the many people who are becoming politicized in these times — knowing that the greater pains and burdens of entering into the delicate and never-ending experiment of solidarity will fall on those already most impacted by the system. It strikes me, too, that it’s frightening to have the kind of hope a struggle like this demands. After all, where there is hope, there is also often heartbreak.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":402,"end":405},{"type":2,"start":415,"end":421}]},{"name":"fcfb","type":7,"text":"I wonder how I can possibly hope to belong to a place like this, how I can identify with a dream that has caused so much pain to so many people.","markups":[]},{"name":"a251","type":1,"text":"But I know, just as well, that our past failures are not inevitable. We can embrace the malleability of this place called America, contest our enemy’s hegemony over its dreams, care about this country and this land and these people, while telling the truth about its brutal history and present, honoring the people who lived here before us, and seeing nationhood not as a barrier to internationalism, but a stepping stone towards it. We can join with the growing majority of people standing in opposition to Trump, while still going on the offensive against all of his enablers — the Republican Party whose agenda he is carrying forth, the huge corporate interests he has since installed into government, and also the Democratic Party establishment whose marriage to Wall Street helped create the conditions for this upheaval in the first place. We can be popular, and big, and speak in a language that the public understands, while bringing a critique of capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy into the mainstream, while holding up a vision for the world we can have if we fight for it, while saying words like single payer healthcare and universal basic income, even reparations and socialism. We can grow our movements dramatically, invest deeply in the transformation of the millions of people looking for a political home in this moment, and build deeply across race, class, gender, and sexuality, while still demanding more from each other, while practicing solidarity and accountability with the wisdom to know that we will fail and try again and fail better if we keep trying. We can enter powerfully into electoral politics, build grassroots political power, take over every potential vehicle for change available to us, while still insisting that movements are what really drive social change, that nothing can replace the hard organizing it takes to bring people together to liberate themselves, that meaningful change demands powerful and uncompromising civil disobedience that removes our consent from the institutions that cause harm.
