Rice. Granddad was a Texas evangelist and founding editor of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Sword of the Lord </em>newspaper, the most influential publication among fundamentalist Christians during the last half of the 20th century. Thousands of white folks — and a handful of blacks — attended John R. Rice’s city-wide revival campaigns during the 1930s and 40s and walked a sawdust trail to kneel at a makeshift plywood altar and invite Jesus into their hearts. Younger Baptist preachers who attended those revival meetings, read the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Sword of the Lord</em>, and were mentored and supported by my Granddad, included neophytes such as Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell and Bob Jones, Jr., each of whom spent years on Granddad’s Board of Trustees.</p><figure name="870b" id="870b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 541px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 77.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*zM3B-ZKAsoy8HYfOZRdKIQ.jpeg" data-width="825" data-height="638" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*zM3B-ZKAsoy8HYfOZRdKIQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zM3B-ZKAsoy8HYfOZRdKIQ.jpeg"></div></figure><h4 name="ea6c" id="ea6c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">We Shall Overcome</h4><p name="e26f" id="e26f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Singing at many of those mass revival meetings was an African-American gospel musician named Elbert Tindley. Tindley was a lyrical tenor with a beatific smile whose voice soared above the crowd. He was heir to a long tradition. His father was the Rev. Dr. Charles Albert Tindley, a minister and gospel music composer, civil rights leader and pastor of the Tindley Temple Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, who played a pivotal role in developing black gospel music at the dawn of the 20th century. Charles Albert Tindley wrote a gospel song titled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I’ll Overcome Someday</em>. The lyrics of Tindley’s song echoed a deep yearning among African-Americans for a world that transcended their mundane experience of slavery, racial violence, poverty, and oppression. The song underwent a process of evolution over the next 50 years or so. By 1960 it was known as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We Shall Overcome</em>, and it was sung by thousands throughout the Southern civil rights movement.</p><figure name="7e9f" id="7e9f" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 313px; max-height: 475px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 151.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ibnp1iUffQNPLGW5clRa7Q.jpeg" data-width="313" data-height="475" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*Ibnp1iUffQNPLGW5clRa7Q.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="d04b" id="d04b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although Granddad had grown up in the racially segregated South, and the vast majority of those listening to his hell-fire-and-damnation sermons were white, he was proud to call Elbert Tindley “my dear friend,” and to claim that he himself was free of any unchristian “race prejudice.” Granddad genuinely believed that he had with God’s help moved beyond the narrow bigotry of his Texas heritage. In a sermon he published as a pamphlet in 1956 titled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Negro and White</em>, he said:</p><blockquote name="dc4e" id="dc4e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“For most of my life I lived near colored people. I worked with colored people and sometimes employed colored people. I have preached in Negro churches. I had Negro choirs to sing in my church. However, my viewpoint is not a typically southern viewpoint. I have lived in the North for sixteen years. I brought from British Guiana in South America a fine Negro young man and helped put him through Moody Bible Institute. He looks to me as to a father…Several of my daughters have worked for months and years in Sunday Schools for colored people in Chicago. They did visitation in the homes of Negro people, loved them, won them to Christ, and taught them the Bible. A colored boy, seventeen, now in the University of Chicago, visited us the other day. A great many Christian Negroes take <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Sword of the Lord </em>and read my books, and I value them most highly. So since I have an intimate knowledge of southern white people and understand their viewpoint, and since I love and respect colored people and have worked with them often, I think I can deal without prejudice as a minister of God with the great principles and problems of race segregation or desegregation.”</blockquote><p name="c602" id="c602" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">My grandparents had six daughters, and every daughter attended Wheaton College — a leading evangelical school — where they met and married Baptist preachers (whose numbers included my own father). The sizable extended family in which I grew up — John R. Rice’s wife, daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren — thought of him as the kindest, funniest, most ethical and admirable human being on earth. Granddad could do no wrong. He was a font of wisdom, humor, and benevolence. Indeed, in all his life not a rumor or taint of scandal or unethical conduct ever clouded his reputation — unlike so many other evangelical luminaries.</p><h4 name="3244" id="3244" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Ice Cream Integration</h4><p name="7aa2" id="7aa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A story told by my aunts — his daughters — highlighting his views on race, concerned his close friendship with Elbert Tindley. One evening in 1948 at the Winona Lake Conference Grounds in Indiana after a session of the “Sword of the Lord Conference on Soul-winning and Revival,” John R. Rice invited Tindley to join the Rice family for dessert at the conference grounds café. When Tindley arrived with John R. and Lloys Rice and their six daughters, the owner of the ice cream parlor refused to serve Tindley and announced that blacks were not welcome in his store. Rice was fiercely indignant and led his family out of the store. He announced that he would tell other Christians not to patronize the store until the owner changed his policy. Quickly, the store owner calculated the impact on his business of a boycott by John R. Rice. Tindley was served along with the Rice family.</p><p name="1335" id="1335" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that my Granddad’s “love and respect for colored people” generally, and for his friend Elbert Tindley in particular, co-existed in a complex admixture with prejudice, blindness, and insensitivity to the call for racial justice that resounded through the South in the 1960s.</p><p name="1be5" id="1be5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In that same 1956 sermon, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Negro and White</em>, in which Granddad declared his “love and respect,” he also decried</p><blockquote name="ff78" id="ff78" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Violent agitation (that) goes on to stop segregation. That agitation I believe is usually uninformed, and it often does more harm than good. The agitation is often carried on by those who are not particularly good citizens nor good Christians, and very often for selfish purposes. The socialists, the communists, the professional and paid Negro leaders, and politicians who hope to gain votes, raise enmities, hurl epithets, threaten force, and incite hate.”</blockquote><figure name="ba63" id="ba63" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 358px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 68.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eGzmqjC3QR8hvK23qR5jaw.jpeg" data-width="605" data-height="412" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*eGzmqjC3QR8hvK23qR5jaw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*eGzmqjC3QR8hvK23qR5jaw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Martin Luther King, Jr., Montgomery, AL in 1956</figcaption></figure><p name="672e" id="672e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">He allowed that Martin Luther King, Jr. and other activists might be “well-meaning and very sincere colored people.

Beyond any shadow of doubt, as replies from editors in all the principal Southern cities have shown to a national magazine which made a survey, the races are farther separated now than they have been in the memory of living people. There is more suspicion, there is less friendly contact, there is less chance to work out the problems. The action of the Supreme Court (in Brown v. Board of Education), the lawsuits and accusations of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the political speechmaking have done great harm.”</blockquote><h4 name="af0c" id="af0c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Emmett Till’s Murder</h4><p name="56f3" id="56f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Remarkably, Granddad concluded that these “racial agitators” were the ones truly responsible for the murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Negro youth who had been savagely beaten to death by white men in Mississippi the previous August of 1955 for his supposed crime of “looking at a white woman.”</p><figure name="5290" id="5290" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 494px; max-height: 470px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 95.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*G-95qT7kl1_iN8k-1cUeOA.jpeg" data-width="494" data-height="470" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G-95qT7kl1_iN8k-1cUeOA.jpeg"></div></figure><blockquote name="4a52" id="4a52" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“That colored boy, who attempted to embrace and to make a date with and to seduce the young married white woman, was spurred on by widespread feeling, a cocky attitude agitators have cultivated among colored people. Remember, it was down in the delta country in Mississippi, where a white woman dare not walk the streets alone at night or go anywhere alone at night because of the animosity and the standards of the large Negro population. On the part of colored people, all this agitation makes for bad incidents. It makes for cases of murder and rape. It makes for some rare cases of vengeance and cases in which offended white men, even good men, take the law in their own hands.”</blockquote><p name="f2db" id="f2db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">A crucial reason to maintain racial segregation, said Granddad, was to protect the health of white people:</p><blockquote name="951e" id="951e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Some years ago in Atlanta, Georgia, I am told, a check proved that venereal disease was ten times as frequent among Negroes as among white people. I know that in Dallas, Texas, where I long lived, the ratio was similar. Now suppose that the question of whether white people and Negro people should use the same swimming pools in the parks in Atlanta comes up. Do you see any reason why intelligent and kindly white people would prefer that Negro people have their own parks and swimming pools and white people use different parks and swimming pools? I think any parent can see that it is not merely race prejudice to prefer that.”</blockquote><p name="302a" id="302a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He added, generously, “I am not saying that Negroes are inherently inferior. Perhaps with the right kind of encouragement and help they will keep on growing culturally and raise their standards. With the right kind of preaching and teaching, they may grow the finest moral standards.”<br>It was an article of faith in my family that we did not share the blatantly racist attitudes of some in our Southern culture; we were better than that. When I was ten years old, my mother Mary Lloys caught me with other children singing “Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the toe, if he hollers make him pay, fifty dollars every day.” She walloped my bottom, and then sat me down to instruct that “civilized people never use that word, the proper pronunciation is NEE-gro.”</p><p name="c39b" id="c39b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nonetheless, I soaked up racial assumptions and attitudes like a sponge. When I was 11, our family moved to the small town of Millington, Tennessee, where my dad became pastor of the Southside Baptist Church. Our family was poor — the church never paid him more than the bare minimum needed to sustain our family — but we were also privileged.</p><h4 name="5cb7" id="5cb7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">My White World</h4><figure name="567b" id="567b" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 350px; max-height: 152px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 43.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gu9n986dAJE8b3llmINIAQ.gif" data-width="400" data-height="174" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*gu9n986dAJE8b3llmINIAQ.gif" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*gu9n986dAJE8b3llmINIAQ.gif"></div></figure><p name="5001" id="5001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The dentist office where my mom took me on a cavity-filling adventure had a sign on the front door that said, “Colored Entrance in Back,” and the barber where my dad took me for 25-cent haircuts had no such sign but also never had a Negro customer sitting in one of his big old leather and chrome high chairs. I saw no Negroes in our public library where I read every single book on the science fiction shelves, and there were no Negro children in attendance at my Millington Central School. The closest I came to one of those mysterious Negroes was when I saw one trudging along the side of the road as I zipped by in my whites-only school bus. Or when I came home from school on Tuesday afternoons to find Mary, a Negro woman hired by my mother at seventy-five cents an hour, upstairs singing away as she ironed our clothes. I visited Mary’s home, a shack in the middle of a cotton field, only once, in the company of my mom, when we delivered a paper bag filled with castoff clothing once worn by my brother John and me — shirts, shoes and pants — for use by Mary’s son. At the time I never questioned our errand, or my mom’s relationship to Mary, or the fact that most of the clothes John and I wore were themselves hand-me-downs from some other white family, so that Mary’s son would be wearing, in effect, doubly cast-off clothes.</p><figure name="9d25" id="9d25" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 368px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 70.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZGZ_2VT3OcHStf8l7xw6cg.jpeg" data-width="1440" data-height="1009" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*ZGZ_2VT3OcHStf8l7xw6cg.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZGZ_2VT3OcHStf8l7xw6cg.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Millington Central High School in Millington, Tennessee</figcaption></figure><p name="21aa" id="21aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When two black children showed up at my school in September of 1963, I experienced a seismic shock that would shift my consciousness and alter the course of my life. A slim, scared-looking boy and a wide-eyed girl, they were met by a howling mob of my eighth-grade classmates, screaming, cursing, jostling them. I stood several paces across the hallway crying uncontrollably and deeply ashamed that I had no courage to walk across the hall and stand together with those black children. Somehow, along with the racial ideas I had inherited from Granddad, I had also received the notion that other people, no matter the color of their skin, should be treated with respect and compassion. My favorite song in Sunday School —<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> “Red and yellow, black and white, all are precious in his sight, Jesus loves the little children of the world.”</em>— had revolutionary implications I had never seriously considered.</p><h4 name="1185" id="1185" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Troubling Questions</h4><p name="b0a5" id="b0a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">After that morning I began a radical shift in my thinking. Over the next three years, quietly and with increasing urgency, I began to ask questions: How could my classmates call themselves Christians and yet behave in such a way? Why did no one in my family comment on or condemn the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which took place in that same month of 1963? Why did my church close its doors to black people? Why did everyone I knew who claimed to be a Christian either maintain silence in response to the movement for racial equality or actively condemn it as “communist-inspired”?</p><p name="8458" id="8458" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My regard for Granddad, along with my relationship with my parents, underwent a gradual transition, took on a troublesome complexity. I still loved Granddad, still admired and respected him, still thought he was the wisest, kindest, and funniest person I knew. As a man, he was still my highest model for who I wanted to be. But I was beginning to arrive at disturbing conclusions about my own family and our core beliefs. And I began to take my first tentative steps toward a critical rejection of Granddad’s politics and his religion.</p><h4 name="b959" id="b959" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Selma Project</h4><p name="9635" id="9635" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">By my last year in high school, I was attending civil rights marches and antiwar teach-ins. By my early 20s, I had thrown myself fulltime into the struggle for racial justice. I moved to Alabama in 1973 to join the staff of the Selma Inter-religious Project, a nonprofit organization created after the 1965 march across Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge, to provide ongoing technical and legal support to grassroots civil rights activists across Alabama’s Black Belt.</p><figure name="bacf" id="bacf" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="640" data-height="480" width="640" height="480" src="/media/951e6dcfa683500c02b3030cdb09b011?postId=dc2fac75826b" data-media-id="951e6dcfa683500c02b3030cdb09b011" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="8d25" id="8d25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There in Alabama I again confronted this difficult contradiction. Many of the local civil rights leaders I worked with were black preachers, mainly Methodists and Primitive Baptists with a few Pentacostals thrown in. And these men, whom I admired and respected, shared a heartfelt set of essential theological doctrines with Granddad: a belief in heaven and hell, the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, inerrancy of scripture, the blood atonement — in short, what they considered fundamentals of the faith, doctrines that had given their name to Granddad’s fundamentalist movement. When I visited the home of a black Baptist preacher named Reverend Jedediah Sullivan in Prichard, a small community just north of Mobile, I found in his library a complete set of books authored by my Granddad: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Soul Winners Fire; We Can Have Revival Now; Prayer: Asking and Receiving; When Skeletons Come Out of the Closets; The Ruin of a Christian; The Home: Courtship, Marriage and Children; Seeking a City</em>, and many others. Reverend Sullivan heard from me of my connection to John R. Rice, and he was overcome with emotion. Tears rolled down his wrinkled cheeks. “Oh my,” he said, “Your granddad, he was a man of God, a sweet, sweet man of God. I have read his books so many times and I have learned so much from him. I am honored and grateful to have you in my home.”</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="8b77" id="8b77" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 750px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*whD2Tr3XJIXpYmJfydkaSQ.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="1200" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*whD2Tr3XJIXpYmJfydkaSQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*whD2Tr3XJIXpYmJfydkaSQ.jpeg"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6ef0" id="6ef0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Reverend Sullivan may have been right. My granddad, John R. Rice, may well have been a man of God. I believe he was. But he was also a man in whose veins ran the blood crime of human slavery, just as it does in mine. In the marrow of his bones, he carried the stain of racist ideas and the potential for racist assumptions, just as I do. He was the son of his father, my great grandfather, Will Rice, who was born into a slave-owning family before the Civil War, whose earliest memories were of blood and fire and death, whose family lost everything in that war, who grew up, in Texas, to become both a Baptist preacher and a leading member of the Ku Klux Klan, and who justified his own acts of violence and hatred against black people. John R. Rice was a man who intended to escape, and believed he had escaped, from the ideological bonds and political assumptions of slave-ownership. He was a man certain he was embracing a new vision for how blacks and whites might coexist and even thrive in the South. He was a man who believed he loved all people, who wanted to save all people from the flames of a literal hell. But in the end he succumbed to the brutal claims of Southern history.</p><blockquote name="298c" id="298c" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">For thus hath the Lord said unto me,<br>Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.<br>Isaiah 21:6</blockquote><figure name="43bf" id="43bf" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--pullquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 227px; max-height: 346px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 152.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*zkceLXl0XYgVZcItM9-SLA.png" data-width="227" data-height="346" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*zkceLXl0XYgVZcItM9-SLA.png"></div></figure><p name="9913" id="9913" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My first reaction on hearing that Harper Lee’s new novel <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Go Set a Watchman</em> offered a different perspective on Atticus Finch, showing us a frail and elderly Atticus, 20 years older than in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mockingbird </em>and displaying the deep-set racial attitudes characteristic of my Granddad, was to want to buy the book and burn it, or flee any room in which someone was reading it.

Charles Albert Tindley wrote a gospel song titled I’ll Overcome Someday. The lyrics of Tindley’s song echoed a deep yearning among African-Americans for a world that transcended their mundane experience of slavery, racial violence, poverty, and oppression. The song underwent a process of evolution over the next 50 years or so. By 1960 it was known as We Shall Overcome, and it was sung by thousands throughout the Southern civil rights movement.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":557,"end":578},{"type":2,"start":860,"end":877}]},{"name":"7e9f","type":4,"text":"","markups":[],"layout":2,"metadata":{"id":"1*Ibnp1iUffQNPLGW5clRa7Q.jpeg","originalWidth":313,"originalHeight":475}},{"name":"d04b","type":1,"text":"Although Granddad had grown up in the racially segregated South, and the vast majority of those listening to his hell-fire-and-damnation sermons were white, he was proud to call Elbert Tindley “my dear friend,” and to claim that he himself was free of any unchristian “race prejudice.” Granddad genuinely believed that he had with God’s help moved beyond the narrow bigotry of his Texas heritage.

Rice invited Tindley to join the Rice family for dessert at the conference grounds café. When Tindley arrived with John R. and Lloys Rice and their six daughters, the owner of the ice cream parlor refused to serve Tindley and announced that blacks were not welcome in his store. Rice was fiercely indignant and led his family out of the store. He announced that he would tell other Christians not to patronize the store until the owner changed his policy.

I saw no Negroes in our public library where I read every single book on the science fiction shelves, and there were no Negro children in attendance at my Millington Central School.

At the time I never questioned our errand, or my mom’s relationship to Mary, or the fact that most of the clothes John and I wore were themselves hand-me-downs from some other white family, so that Mary’s son would be wearing, in effect, doubly cast-off clothes.","markups":[]},{"name":"9d25","type":4,"text":"Millington Central High School in Millington, Tennessee","markups":[],"layout":4,"metadata":{"id":"1*ZGZ_2VT3OcHStf8l7xw6cg.jpeg","originalWidth":1440,"originalHeight":1009}},{"name":"21aa","type":1,"text":"When two black children showed up at my school in September of 1963, I experienced a seismic shock that would shift my consciousness and alter the course of my life. A slim, scared-looking boy and a wide-eyed girl, they were met by a howling mob of my eighth-grade classmates, screaming, cursing, jostling them. I stood several paces across the hallway crying uncontrollably and deeply ashamed that I had no courage to walk across the hall and stand together with those black children. Somehow, along with the racial ideas I had inherited from Granddad, I had also received the notion that other people, no matter the color of their skin, should be treated with respect and compassion. My favorite song in Sunday School — “Red and yellow, black and white, all are precious in his sight, Jesus loves the little children of the world.”— had revolutionary implications I had never seriously considered.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":721,"end":833}]},{"name":"1185","type":13,"text":"Troubling Questions","markups":[]},{"name":"b0a5","type":1,"text":"After that morning I began a radical shift in my thinking. Over the next three years, quietly and with increasing urgency, I began to ask questions: How could my classmates call themselves Christians and yet behave in such a way? Why did no one in my family comment on or condemn the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which took place in that same month of 1963? Why did my church close its doors to black people? Why did everyone I knew who claimed to be a Christian either maintain silence in response to the movement for racial equality or actively condemn it as “communist-inspired”?","markups":[]},{"name":"8458","type":1,"text":"My regard for Granddad, along with my relationship with my parents, underwent a gradual transition, took on a troublesome complexity. I still loved Granddad, still admired and respected him, still thought he was the wisest, kindest, and funniest person I knew. As a man, he was still my highest model for who I wanted to be. But I was beginning to arrive at disturbing conclusions about my own family and our core beliefs. And I began to take my first tentative steps toward a critical rejection of Granddad’s politics and his religion.","markups":[]},{"name":"b959","type":13,"text":"The Selma Project","markups":[]},{"name":"9635","type":1,"text":"By my last year in high school, I was attending civil rights marches and antiwar teach-ins.

Many of the local civil rights leaders I worked with were black preachers, mainly Methodists and Primitive Baptists with a few Pentacostals thrown in. And these men, whom I admired and respected, shared a heartfelt set of essential theological doctrines with Granddad: a belief in heaven and hell, the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, inerrancy of scripture, the blood atonement — in short, what they considered fundamentals of the faith, doctrines that had given their name to Granddad’s fundamentalist movement. When I visited the home of a black Baptist preacher named Reverend Jedediah Sullivan in Prichard, a small community just north of Mobile, I found in his library a complete set of books authored by my Granddad: The Soul Winners Fire; We Can Have Revival Now; Prayer: Asking and Receiving; When Skeletons Come Out of the Closets; The Ruin of a Christian; The Home: Courtship, Marriage and Children; Seeking a City, and many others. Reverend Sullivan heard from me of my connection to John R. Rice, and he was overcome with emotion. Tears rolled down his wrinkled cheeks. “Oh my,” he said, “Your granddad, he was a man of God, a sweet, sweet man of God. I have read his books so many times and I have learned so much from him. I am honored and grateful to have you in my home.”","markups":[{"type":2,"start":798,"end":999}]},{"name":"8b77","type":4,"text":"","markups":[],"layout":3,"metadata":{"id":"1*whD2Tr3XJIXpYmJfydkaSQ.jpeg","originalWidth":1600,"originalHeight":1200}},{"name":"6ef0","type":1,"text":"Reverend Sullivan may have been right. My granddad, John R. Rice, may well have been a man of God. I believe he was. But he was also a man in whose veins ran the blood crime of human slavery, just as it does in mine. In the marrow of his bones, he carried the stain of racist ideas and the potential for racist assumptions, just as I do. He was the son of his father, my great grandfather, Will Rice, who was born into a slave-owning family before the Civil War, whose earliest memories were of blood and fire and death, whose family lost everything in that war, who grew up, in Texas, to become both a Baptist preacher and a leading member of the Ku Klux Klan, and who justified his own acts of violence and hatred against black people. John R. Rice was a man who intended to escape, and believed he had escaped, from the ideological bonds and political assumptions of slave-ownership. He was a man certain he was embracing a new vision for how blacks and whites might coexist and even thrive in the South. He was a man who believed he loved all people, who wanted to save all people from the flames of a literal hell. But in the end he succumbed to the brutal claims of Southern history.","markups":[]},{"name":"298c","type":7,"text":"For thus hath the Lord said unto me,\nGo, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.\nIsaiah 21:6","markups":[]},{"name":"43bf","type":4,"text":"","markups":[],"layout":2,"metadata":{"id":"1*zkceLXl0XYgVZcItM9-SLA.png","originalWidth":227,"originalHeight":346}},{"name":"9913","type":1,"text":"My first reaction on hearing that Harper Lee’s new novel Go Set a Watchman offered a different perspective on Atticus Finch, showing us a frail and elderly Atticus, 20 years older than in Mockingbird and displaying the deep-set racial attitudes characteristic of my Granddad, was to want to buy the book and burn it, or flee any room in which someone was reading it.
