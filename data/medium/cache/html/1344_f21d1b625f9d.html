Her first week on the clock she reached out to Postmodern Jukebox — a band with a tremendous YouTube following for their vintage renditions of pop songs, led by trained jazz pianist Scott Bradlee — and asked if they would be interested in collaborating with an orchestra for a Roaring Twenties style party. What a “supremely awesome request” was the response from the band’s manager. The event went on to achieve triple the attendance of the last gala with more than half of attendees being new to the organization. And, here’s the kicker: the average revenue per patron who returned in the year after the event (i.e. their value to the organization in the 12 months following their first interaction with us at this event) was $438 in ticket sales and donations, all completely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">new</em> money the organization had not previously seen. That’s not chump change, especially given these people’s previous value to us was zero. In fact, the ROI per each returning patron was 1403% in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just one year</em>.</p><h4 name="f7cd" id="f7cd" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The ROI per each returning patron was 1403% in just one year.”</h4><h4 name="fdc7" id="fdc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">How it Was Done</h4><p name="8196" id="8196" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Unpacking this success, there were a lot of things we did as we revamped our special events. In this business, it’s never build-it-and-they-will-come; it’s always work, and a lot of work in a very short period of time is what we hustled to do:</p><p name="0555" id="0555" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Location/venue.</strong> We knew if we were going to attract a different demographic, the country clubs of yore were out.

No full dinner, and no guaranteed seat, but plenty of ambient seating options and cocktail tables to gather around. We sold a lot of these, and this was the entry point for most new people. We also offered our standard $500 dinner ticket and hosted tables, and those folks enjoyed the best seats at tables right in front of the stage, a full three-course meal, and hosted wine all night as usual for high-end special events at that price.</p><figure name="fcb6" id="fcb6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 438px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1QixyJMSg0HJXe2IhJ4Eaw.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="600" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*1QixyJMSg0HJXe2IhJ4Eaw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1QixyJMSg0HJXe2IhJ4Eaw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Left: Dinner ticket buyers (higher price more typical of a gala with prime seating and dinner); Right: Cocktail ticket buyers (lower price with drinks, appetizers, and dance floor)</figcaption></figure><p name="0abf" id="0abf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Intentionally sought out young volunteers</strong>.

We knew that getting these new attendees to come back again was where the real challenge resided in terms of making all this work worth it, so we created a station where guests could write postcards (fitting with the theme and the new invention of airmail in the 1920s), to themselves or to friends, to whoever and as many as they wanted. After the event, we stamped and mailed all of them, and all those guests received their own memory elicitation device reminding themselves what a great time they had.

We (i.e. all performing arts organizations) blow people away at our regular concerts, and we (i.e. the California Symphony) wanted to do that here, too. Postmodern Jukebox is known for putting on incredibly entertaining shows (they even have a professional tap dancer!), and we knew that adding an orchestra would only enhance their performance. And we were right; PMJ and the musicians of the California Symphony rocked it. A question we’re often asked is how the musicians felt about it. The answer is good, and almost all their comments were in fact very similar to what we heard from patrons: “What a fun show that was! That was so awesome to see so many new people! Everyone was really into it!”</p><figure name="f3bf" id="f3bf" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 438px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KBOpYW1DPzPiJYAPFX88xA.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="600" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*KBOpYW1DPzPiJYAPFX88xA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KBOpYW1DPzPiJYAPFX88xA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Performance with Postmodern Jukebox, their first orchestra collaboration.</figcaption></figure><p name="4120" id="4120" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Didn’t call it a gala</strong>. Never once did we call this event a gala — not internally or externally. We gave it a name, Speakeasy Symphony, and we developed a new vocabulary for how we talk about our events. Instead of saying “gala,” we use words like “fun” and “entertaining.” We know, this is [not] deep. But before you think George Merriam and Noah Webster are rolling in their graves, consider the business we’re in, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">entertainment</em> business, and at the end of the day, we are vying for people’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">entertainment</em> dollars. In other words, we now don’t ask, “What can we do for our next gala for it to really be a great fundraiser?” Instead we ask, “How can we create a program or event that is interesting and entertaining and FUN?” We have proven that if we can do that, people come and then the money follows.</p><h4 name="e732" id="e732" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Consider the business we’re in, the <em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">entertainment</em> business, and at the end of the day, we are vying for people’s <em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">entertainment</em> dollars.”</h4><h4 name="2f3a" id="2f3a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Moving Forward</h4><p name="b74f" id="b74f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">What do you do after an event like that? How do you follow it? Two main tracks emerged for us in our event follow-up:</p><p name="75cb" id="75cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Use the data to see what worked.</p><p name="0772" id="0772" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Plan next year’s event to be just as good, but different.</p><p name="add7" id="add7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have said again and again on this blog that new audiences are NOT the Holy Grail. New audiences matter, and yes, as a field, we must be cultivating new audiences; however, getting someone to attend for the first time is not the end goal. Most orchestras are very successful at getting people to come once; it’s getting those people to come back a second time and ultimately cultivate a longer-term relationship where most of us actually need to focus.</p><p name="392d" id="392d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we did that. We invited those newcomers to return again and again, and it played out like this: now, two years, later, 11% of those first time attendees have returned. In the first year after the event, only 5% had returned, which on the surface, to us sounded really horrible at first. We dug deeper and learned that for those who did return, the average revenue per patron over the following year was $438 in ticket sales and donations. As we said at the top of this post, that’s $438 in new revenue <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">per person</em> in just one year that the California Symphony had not previously seen, and it’s a lot higher than the one-time ticket price that patron paid originally (remember, most of those new people originally came in at the $125 cocktail price….one year later they are spending $438 a year on average, which is nearly two and a half times what they originally spent — THAT’S not too shabby we decided.).</p><h4 name="7045" id="7045" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“When you only have 6–7 concert sets a year, it’s really difficult to argue that any of those shouldn’t serve your core audience well.”</h4><p name="56c3" id="56c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As we set out to plan the following year’s special event fundraiser, we loved the idea of using a non-traditional venue and knew we wanted to keep that element. We also knew we wanted to strike a better balance between new attendees and our core audience. Side note: perhaps this is a consideration more relevant to small and mid-size budget organizations because when you only have 6–7 concert sets a year, it’s really difficult to argue that any of those shouldn’t serve your core audience well.</p><p name="63d7" id="63d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A new event, called Cirque du Symphonie (think Cirque du Soleil with live orchestra), was the answer to that, and we did land a healthier mix of new attendees versus core audience:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2eda" id="2eda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">More of our core patrons wanted to come. Closer to a 60/40 (returning/new) split instead of over half being new like it was for Speakeasy Symphony.</li><li name="62cd" id="62cd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">New attendees = 37% (again, reflecting a better balance of new and returning patrons)</li><li name="7bac" id="7bac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">New donors realized through the event = 30%</li><li name="62ca" id="62ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">New patrons who have since returned (at the time of this writing, we are nine months after the event) = 6%, which is on par with, albeit slightly ahead of, the trend we saw after Speakeasy Symphony (which was 5% first timer return in 12 months following the event).</li></ul><p name="df63" id="df63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This season, we are coming up on our third year of this revamped special event series as we celebrate the orchestra’s 30th anniversary. The theme is “Symphony Surround,” and the orchestra will literally surround guests at dinner tables as they perform. Lined up is superstar violinist Anne Akiko Meyers who had a connection to our orchestra when she first performed here at the young age of 24; she returns now in gratitude for the California Symphony’s role in launching her career. Plus, it’s at another rad venue: the Blackhawk Automotive Museum full of one-of-kind classic cars (even the non-gear heads will enjoy the vintage bling on these cars).</p><figure name="fd6a" id="fd6a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 438px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*G_SUqsGIyaj3itbxFkb8JA.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="600" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*G_SUqsGIyaj3itbxFkb8JA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G_SUqsGIyaj3itbxFkb8JA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Symphony Surround is the third iteration in the California Symphony’s newly designed special event model.</figcaption></figure><p name="741a" id="741a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">In summary, special events — like almost everything else we do as arts organizations — are hard and getting harder. Board consultant Chuck Loring said it best at a recent board development seminar produced by the League of American Orchestras, “We have to ask ourselves how special events fit in with our overall stewardship plan. We have to make sure we are creating repeat donors. Before you ever plan another event, you should first decide what the second date is AFTER this event before deciding to do the event in the first place.” Here, we are constantly asking ourselves if the juice is worth the squeeze, and at one point nearly four years ago, the board decided the answer was no, it wasn’t worth it, at least in its then format. We took a risk (which in hindsight wasn’t really much of a risk since something needed to change) to hit the reset button and completely re-imagine the way we thought about fundraising events for our organization. And we’ll never look back and say the word “gala” again.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="u-paddingTop10"><div class="container u-maxWidth740"><div class="row"><div class="col

Her first week on the clock she reached out to Postmodern Jukebox — a band with a tremendous YouTube following for their vintage renditions of pop songs, led by trained jazz pianist Scott Bradlee — and asked if they would be interested in collaborating with an orchestra for a Roaring Twenties style party. What a “supremely awesome request” was the response from the band’s manager. The event went on to achieve triple the attendance of the last gala with more than half of attendees being new to the organization. And, here’s the kicker: the average revenue per patron who returned in the year after the event (i.e. their value to the organization in the 12 months following their first interaction with us at this event) was $438 in ticket sales and donations, all completely new money the organization had not previously seen. That’s not chump change, especially given these people’s previous value to us was zero.

As we said at the top of this post, that’s $438 in new revenue per person in just one year that the California Symphony had not previously seen, and it’s a lot higher than the one-time ticket price that patron paid originally (remember, most of those new people originally came in at the $125 cocktail price….one year later they are spending $438 a year on average, which is nearly two and a half times what they originally spent — THAT’S not too shabby we decided.).","markups":[{"type":2,"start":505,"end":515}]},{"name":"7045","type":13,"text":"“When you only have 6–7 concert sets a year, it’s really difficult to argue that any of those shouldn’t serve your core audience well.”","markups":[]},{"name":"56c3","type":1,"text":"As we set out to plan the following year’s special event fundraiser, we loved the idea of using a non-traditional venue and knew we wanted to keep that element.

We have to make sure we are creating repeat donors. Before you ever plan another event, you should first decide what the second date is AFTER this event before deciding to do the event in the first place.” Here, we are constantly asking ourselves if the juice is worth the squeeze, and at one point nearly four years ago, the board decided the answer was no, it wasn’t worth it, at least in its then format.
