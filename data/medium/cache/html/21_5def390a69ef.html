The year was 2013 and he was the unknown star of a movie no one had heard of, made on the cheap, and directed by a guy who hadn’t made anything in six years. Blair was sitting in a vast auditorium in France with hundreds of strangers, seated beside his friend and collaborator, the writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who had risked everything to get their grisly drama, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em>, into the world. Finally, people were about to see what Saulnier and Blair had accomplished together. They had reason to be scared.</p><p name="698a" id="698a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Several months prior, Saulnier stood in front of a camera and made a pitch. He needed to raise $35,000 via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958674053/blue-ruin" data-href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958674053/blue-ruin" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> to finance his movie independently. Saulnier described the movie as “a revenge film equally suited for art house cinephiles and die-hard genre fans.” Somehow, he compelled 438 donors to kick in $37,828. But even that wasn’t enough — after reaching the Kickstarter goal, Saulnier dumped thousands of his own savings, mortgaged his house, liquidated his wife’s retirement fund, and dove headlong into credit card debt before <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> was funded and ultimately completed. Eight months after the Kickstarter campaign, the movie made its premiere at the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/18/11-films-that-were-booed-at-cannes/" data-href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/18/11-films-that-were-booed-at-cannes/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jeer-happy</a> Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors’ Fortnight, and that’s where Blair became really nervous. With no distribution, debt looming, and anonymity haunting them, the fate of the movie — and something resembling the future — hung in the balance.</p><p name="95aa" id="95aa" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I can’t imagine what it must have felt like for Jeremy,” Blair says. “Even for me, just being secondarily involved, there’s this huge pressure.” Blair knew that it wasn’t just that audiences needed to like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em>. Someone needed to pay for it.</p><p name="5285" id="5285" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You gotta sell the thing, and if it doesn’t sell,” Blair says, “they might have to move or they’re gonna be broke. Everything was on the line.”</p><p name="3aa5" id="3aa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later that day, the movie <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/deals-weinsteins-radius-buy-blue-ruin-after-cannes-premiere-92541/" data-href="http://www.thewrap.com/deals-weinsteins-radius-buy-blue-ruin-after-cannes-premiere-92541/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold</a> to the Weinstein Company’s boutique outfit, Radius, for a reported $500,000 — enough to recoup the Saulniers and provide a budget to distribute the movie. The world would see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em>, and Jeremy Saulnier would not be homeless. In a statement issued shortly after the deal was made, Radius copresidents Tom Quinn and Jason Janego said: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> is a masterpiece and a future cult classic. It is one of the most exceptional discoveries of the last few years thanks to Jeremy’s deft hand.”</p><p name="622a" id="622a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Less than one year later, the movie premiered in America. And while it earned less than $1 million during a brief theatrical run, Quinn and Janego were right: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> has become a kind of cult classic, a vicious and precise thriller that singes the eyebrows. It lives on, but not through midnight screenings or hipster video store clerks. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> entered the wider consciousness when the movie was made available to stream on Netflix — then quaintly known as Netflix Instant — in August 2014.<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>Netflix famously does not reveal streaming viewership data, but the mostly anonymous Saulnier’s little-seen little movie predicted a vast wave of possibility, foretelling a major shift in the industry.</p><p name="e3b2" id="e3b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> is a modern indie movie success story; its arc recalls the ’90s heyday of the Weinsteins, Quentin Tarantino, and the acquisition hype cycle. But it leveraged the new vagaries of movie production, including an evolving festival culture, streaming platforms, and crowdfunding. In many ways, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> is much like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Reservoir Dogs</em>, a movie that arrived like a comet 25 years ago at the Sundance Film Festival. But it’s different, too — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Reservoir Dogs</em> was a video store phenomenon made by a director whose cinephilia was forged in a video store. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> is a streaming baby, christened by Netflix.</p><p name="55da" id="55da" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“When I was working on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em>, that was the first time we were exposed to this whole world of streaming,” Blair says. “And at first, it’s not that we were suspicious; we were just like, ‘I don’t know how this works. Are people even gonna see it if it’s just on demand?’ And as it turned out, it seems as though people saw that movie much, much more on streaming platforms than they did in the theater. It makes a lot of sense, especially for smaller movies that maybe don’t have a big star in them or maybe they don’t have a ton of money for promotion and they can be discovered by word of mouth.”</p><p name="c81e" id="c81e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With its success has come the spoils of a bona fide indie movie hit: Saulnier has become a name-brand filmmaker after last year’s (even grislier) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Green Room</em>, and the sad-eyed Blair has become a working actor in Hollywood — he appeared in the Matthew McConaughey drama <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gold </em>earlier this year and will be in the forthcoming Steven Soderbergh comedy <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Logan Lucky</em>. Blair’s a filmmaker in his own right now, too. His directorial debut, the similarly violent crime drama <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em>, premiered at Sundance in January, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. But Blair wasn’t much scared at the premiere of this movie. Its future was clear.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="e048" id="e048" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 188px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 18.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XgGimpgWG1U_dmeiT60x8Q.png" data-width="2506" data-height="472" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*XgGimpgWG1U_dmeiT60x8Q.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*XgGimpgWG1U_dmeiT60x8Q.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d18f" id="d18f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“When we took this one to Sundance this year, its distribution was already all stitched up. It had been from the beginning,” Blair says. “It was kind of relaxing because there was nothing to worry about. Obviously you hope people are going to enjoy it and the audience is going to like it and it’s gonna get reviewed nicely, but at the very least, we didn’t have to worry about who was gonna buy it, because it was already a done deal.”</p><p name="dd0b" id="dd0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Blair didn’t have to contend with the typical festival experience: He didn’t have to idly wait to hear about bids on his movie. He didn’t have to field calls from his agent or pitch the marketing vision to executives. He didn’t have to haggle over recutting or reshooting the movie’s violent conclusion. And he didn’t have to wait very long for the rest of the world to discover his movie, and that’s because <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em> was paid for and is distributed exclusively by Netflix. In a highly unusual strategy, four weeks after he took home the Grand Jury Prize in Park City, his movie was made available to the streaming service’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/01/19/netflix-subscriber-growth-continues-unabated-as-margins-improve/#40f1f5d852dd" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/01/19/netflix-subscriber-growth-continues-unabated-as-margins-improve/#40f1f5d852dd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">approximately 94 million subscribers</a> worldwide.</p><p name="1732" id="1732" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“With <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Blue Ruin</em> … we took pretty much a full year of traveling to different festivals to promote it before it came out,” Blair says of the movie, which appeared in theaters more than 11 months after that fateful night at Cannes. “And in this case, it was like almost less than a month. A <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much</em> faster turnaround.”</p><figure name="3df9" id="3df9" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 350px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0-bh0BDxAGIVV7qumQywmQ.jpeg" data-width="2500" data-height="1667" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*0-bh0BDxAGIVV7qumQywmQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*0-bh0BDxAGIVV7qumQywmQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Quentin Tarantino and John Cooper at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival (Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p name="88e3" id="88e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Independent cinema is moving out of the art house and into every house. The collapse of this viewing window and the bidding-war armistice has been mitigated by prefab dealmaking. Technocratic distribution companies like Netflix and Amazon have upended the state of independently produced movies. Film festivals that screen these movies were once the bastion for work created beyond the perception of Hollywood’s studio structures — films that were either unable or unwilling to penetrate the cast iron gates that lead to the moviemaking seats of power. The festivals were a home for insurgents, temples that hoisted Tarantino, Michael Moore, Sofia Coppola, Kevin Smith, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, Todd Solondz, Todd Haynes, Ava DuVernay, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, and dozens more into the frame. Today, a movie that has been bought, paid for, and strategized against a global calendar by a massive public company is dissonant with the spirit of independent movies.</p><p name="0c99" id="0c99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is happening is not an erosion of indie cinema, per se, nor a dissolution of risk-taking work — Saulnier’s and Blair’s films are unforgiving and uncompromising genre movies, as likely to bleed and wail as anything from 1992. But their parentage raises some fascinating questions about origins, funding, and accessibility in an evolving movie culture. Netflix and Amazon are eating yet another part of the entertainment community. But what happens when everything has been swallowed up?</p><figure name="6ce4" id="6ce4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 40px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 5.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*LGn3x085RUn-eHmA." data-width="700" data-height="40" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LGn3x085RUn-eHmA."></div></figure><figure name="ad1d" id="ad1d" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 37%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="500" data-height="185" width="500" height="185" src="/media/41bbf1a340f9e420c07e4903e1f69ca9?postId=5def390a69ef" data-media-id="41bbf1a340f9e420c07e4903e1f69ca9" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F377971916%2FButtersDoctor_bigger.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="1fe2" id="1fe2" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap"><span class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="width: 194px; height: 111px;"><span class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 57.3%;"></span><img class="graf-dropCapImage" data-image-id="1*U4ZO7z4wZ8tnBa0PSylM6Q.png" data-width="260" data-height="149" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*U4ZO7z4wZ8tnBa0PSylM6Q.png"></span><span class="graf-dropCapText"><span class="graf-dropCapQuote">“</span>W</span></span>e’re not the same,” Ted Sarandos <a href="https://deadline.com/2016/05/tk-netflix-ted-sarandos-bright-screening-room-mike-fleming-interview-1201752057/" data-href="https://deadline.com/2016/05/tk-netflix-ted-sarandos-bright-screening-room-mike-fleming-interview-1201752057/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Deadline</em></a> last year. “[Amazon] put themselves in the place of Sony Pictures Classics. That’s not really a disruption as much as it is a replacement. What I’m trying to do is take the benefits and the beautiful byproduct of the internet, which is all about consumer choice, and apply it to movies where no one else has. The theatrical movie window is the only window that really still exists. Every other form of entertainment is pretty much available to consumers where and when they want it. Perpetuating the movie window — adding new money to perpetuate the old system — I don’t think is really that interesting.”</p><p name="bdf5" id="bdf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sarandos is the chief content officer at Netflix, and his gentle trolling of Amazon is notable. (Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on the record for this story.) Both companies have grand ambitions in the movie business, which consumers will see in releases in coming months. But before that, we can see how they plan to overwhelm the industry in the same way that they have in TV. Netflix goes direct to its service, with virtually no theatrical window. Amazon operates in a more traditional fashion, holding the window open before sending its original films to its streaming platform offered via Amazon Prime. Amazon applies lessons learned from working within the Hollywood studio experience; Netflix defies them at will. Their strategies are different, but the endgame feels largely the same — attack the most vulnerable market in movies: the little guys.</p><p name="aef4" id="aef4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In recent years, many of the indie-boutique shingles that the major studios once supported — Paramount Vantage, Warner Independent Pictures — have closed up shop. They’ve become victims of an increasingly corporatized, IP-centric major studio strategy. Those that remain, including Fox Searchlight, Miramax, and Focus Features, have been weakened. These satellite operations working inside corporations supported independent filmmakers and smaller projects, in an effort to serve arthouse audiences, court award season prestige, and provide the corporations a bit of soul. The continued dissolution of these outlets has created an open lane. In their place, a new breed of independent-minded curators — based largely in Silicon Valley and Seattle — has risen. The tension between them starts in theaters and ends at home.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="6efe" id="6efe" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 221px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 22.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0uUk04uzUYfFkwzrlL_HvA.png" data-width="2506" data-height="554" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*0uUk04uzUYfFkwzrlL_HvA.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*0uUk04uzUYfFkwzrlL_HvA.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d0cf" id="d0cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“If Screening Room happened,” Sarandos said last year, “that would be real disruption.”</p><p name="7c9e" id="7c9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Screening Room is the much-ballyhooed initiative by Sean Parker, onetime Facebook president and entrepreneur.

But in the year since it was announced, and right underneath its nose, Sarandos and his friendly competitors at Amazon have been subverting the very process by which movies are seen, giving people who are uninterested in the theatergoing experience a way to get their content quickly and easily. They have built a Screening Room experience inside their own business model.</p><p name="631d" id="631d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There’s no physical supply chain,” Sarandos told <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Deadline</em>. “So the idea that you could do something on a global platform was impossible then and more than possible right now — and the norm.

Sarandos fashions himself as an old-school Hollywood Showman–meets–Silicon Valley Great Man — Steve Jobs with a creased copy of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Kid Stays in the Picture</em>. These are incisive and persuasive words from someone who has spent a lot of time imagining how best to completely upend a system he perceives as broken. Or, at least, ready for the taking. It’s Ayn Randian thinking, and perhaps justified.

But recently, the visibility of everything he’s made has been elevated on a streaming service.</p><p name="aa0e" id="aa0e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Drinking Buddies</em> honestly found its biggest audience on Netflix,” Swanberg tells me after the premiere of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Win It All </em>at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. “It’s become pretty clear to me over the last few years that the work that I’m making is finding its audience there. And so I have [to face] the question as a filmmaker and Jake [Johnson] and I as business partners: Do we go where the audience is or do we make the audience come to us? I just think it’s not our nature, we’re not the kind of guys that are going to put our foot down and be like, ‘No, you have to experience it this way.’ If there’s a big audience over there that wants to watch it, and we already made the movie we want, that makes the most sense to both of us.”</p><figure name="6c6c" id="6c6c" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="/media/2d1ba50a88e5511c57ecb49c5fd36fb2?postId=5def390a69ef" data-media-id="2d1ba50a88e5511c57ecb49c5fd36fb2" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FScKPEIg62eI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="d6d7" id="d6d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Win It All</em>, like Swanberg’s previous Netflix-distributed films <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Digging for Fire</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Drinking Buddies</em>, was made for less than $5 million and grossed far less than that; these are movies you can, and maybe should, stream. They are stylistically sturdy but unglamorous and crafted with a workaday mien that suits their makers. They glide, but they don’t necessarily soar. Netflix is the perfect home for them. And it’s the only place Swanberg and Johnson took a rough cut of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Win It All</em>, the only partner they were interested in.</p><p name="ef94" id="ef94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swanberg has even expanded to TV with <a href="https://theringer.com/easy-is-auteur-tv-done-right-33b301f335da" data-href="https://theringer.com/easy-is-auteur-tv-done-right-33b301f335da" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">the anthology series<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> Easy</em></a> (also exclusively available and paid for by Netflix), which resembles the style of his movies. A second season is already in production. Its success insinuates an emerging aesthetic: Netflix-core. Soon, there may be no movies and TV, only Netflix and Amazon and other streaming bankrolled product. In the meantime, for an artist like Swanberg with a modest background and limited reach to this point, the collaboration is a win, no matter the length or form.</p><figure name="9d70" id="9d70" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 20.8%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="800" data-height="166" width="525" height="109" src="/media/3d10ad4d685d4df790f5b979d6ef9148?postId=5def390a69ef" data-media-id="3d10ad4d685d4df790f5b979d6ef9148" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000216619840-9mtiv5-t500x500.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="7e7d" id="7e7d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“After making <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Easy</em>, where the show goes up on the same day to 170 countries all around the world, Netflix called me and they were like, ‘It did really well in America.

It’s just that they never had a chance to see it because a French distributor and a German distributor is like, ‘I’m not about to lose $300,000 trying to turn French people on to mumblecore movies.

But with the Netflix access, those people finally had a chance to see my work and they were like, ‘We like it!’ Now we get to go back to them and say, ‘Check this one out.’”</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="6d2c" id="6d2c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 196px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 19.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OJ6S7rAjzqAGAOkNcF4JrQ.png" data-width="2506" data-height="492" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*OJ6S7rAjzqAGAOkNcF4JrQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*OJ6S7rAjzqAGAOkNcF4JrQ.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="363c" id="363c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Swanberg is an artistic pragmatist who has found a distribution partner that suits his pragmatism. Swanberg and Johnson, who made his name as one of the stars of Fox’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">New Girl</em>, throw their own money in together for these projects — and they both speak forthrightly about upending the financial models of moviemaking, finding ways to get the most money to the people most responsible for their creative execution. It’s an intriguing anti-Hollywood populism, crafted by a mumblecore pioneer and a sitcom star — the duo have formed a sort of modern-day Robert Altman–Elliott Gould–style pairing. Johnson — who was featured in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Jurassic World</em> and has a part in the upcoming <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mummy</em> reboot starring Tom Cruise — is particularly intimate with the corporate machinery that can envelope a creative project.</p><p name="940c" id="940c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We get to cut out all middlemen and just make work and say, ‘Do you guys like it?

That’s not Schmidt! Oh, it’s the other one.’ Just hit it. And you start it and if in those first few minutes, you’re out, I get it. But if you’re in, and you like it, then that’s actually the fan we want who then goes, ‘What else have they done?’ And I’m like, let’s just make movies for that person and say, ‘Yeah, you want to watch this one again?’ You just put your baby to sleep, you got two hours before it starts crying, here’s an hour and a half.

So there is something odd about wanting audiences to experience the movie, which follows a hapless Chicago gambler who just so happens to come into the possession of a big bag of cash, at home on Netflix. For Netflix’s part, the equation is still evolving.</p><p name="5dcc" id="5dcc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There’s a romantic notion about the film being on a big screen,” said Sarandos last year. “There’s definitely something about a premiere at [main Sundance venue] Eccles that you can’t replicate — that I can’t replicate — but the fact is, that happens for a couple hundred people once a year. We’re doing it every day for the world. People who are discovering a movie that might change their life; that’s who they’re talking to. We have to get rid of the romantic part. I don’t really think that they’re mutually exclusive.

We premiered on a Saturday and then starting Sunday, there are phone calls — ‘Oh, we’re gonna do this,’ and, ‘We want to sit down with you, but we want to change these pieces,’ and, ‘We want to take it into direct to VOD, but here’s how we’re gonna do it.’ Other people were like, ‘We’ll just put it on the screen now.’ There were some people who didn’t want to touch it; there were some people who were like, ‘What if we reshoot this piece?’ All that is part of the conversation.”</p><p name="8e15" id="8e15" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We were open to whatever anyone was saying,” Dillard says. “But — and maybe it’s naive — we wanted to see this movie in theaters. I understand that the distribution model is rapidly changing every single day and Netflix and Amazon are just as good as opening on 2,000 screens. But for this movie [theatrical distribution was the right choice], and honestly that was motivated by what the energy of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sleight</em> was at the festival.”</p><p name="359b" id="359b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sleight </em>follows a young street magician who gets caught up in a drug dealer’s web and is forced to use some of his skills to escape — it’s a genre movie, craftily made on the cheap.

It helps with customer perception, it helps with filmmakers, so we’re very supportive of the theatrical window.”</p><p name="5e6c" id="5e6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That sentiment is still powerful for a filmmaker like James Gray, who has released five films with independent distributors.

People assume that art forms last forever. But let’s face it: If you were a composer of opera, you would be in deep trouble. Opera was a popular medium in 1860 or 1870 and when Verdi died, 400,000 lined the streets of Rome for his funeral. And today you can go to the opera, but you dress up and it’s $300 for a great seat, which is crazy. And who can pay that? It’s become a rarefied thing. And I started to see that movies, the tradition where you go and sit in the theater and pay your money and eat your popcorn, enjoy that as a communal experience, that that was under grave threat. This was 10 years ago. I don’t think that anything I’ve said then was disproven by anything happening now. I think where we’re headed, which is a world that is [dictated by] Amazon and Netflix, is essentially you watch these things at home on your 60- or 70-inch television. I’m against that.”</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="d02f" id="d02f" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 164px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 16.400000000000002%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*j63WmfPWz1eXwBPx2sCG_Q.png" data-width="2506" data-height="410" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*j63WmfPWz1eXwBPx2sCG_Q.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*j63WmfPWz1eXwBPx2sCG_Q.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6937" id="6937" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Netflix has announced at least 20 more original films that will be released on its service this year, ranging in size from Sundance to Sandler. Amazon Studios is newer to the field, releasing one film in 2015 and 15 last year, including major achievements, like Park Chan-wook’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Handmaiden</em> and Jim Jarmusch’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Paterson</em>,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>that would otherwise have been forced to find distribution with one of the boutique distribution houses. Amazon has 14 films planned for this year, including production and distribution for Todd Haynes’s followup to<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> Carol</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Wonderstruck</em>,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>as well as Richard Linklater’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Last Flag Flying</em>, a sequel to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Last Detail</em> starring Bryan Cranston; it produced, and will co-distribute, Doug Liman’s John Cena–starring <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Wall </em>with Roadside Attractions; it also picked up distribution for the Sundance darling <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Big Sick</em>. Amazon’s strategy, overseen by Price, Head of World Wide Film Jason Ropell, and Head of Motion Picture Production Ted Hope, is an amalgam that is driven by taste and inbound experience. Hope, whose Good Machine Films production company was a driving force in ’90s indie cinema, has brought 30 years of knowledge to Amazon. He’s an idealist in a confusing environment.</p><p name="d790" id="d790" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I really do believe that we, the creative community, are on the precipice of what I think will be the greatest period in filmmaking ever,” Hope said last summer at the Seattle Film Festival. “I know you all want to know about the secret Amazon algorithms for how we pick our films and spend money. … I constantly say, ‘Why do movies suck? Why are these scripts just not better?’ This is my first pass at talking about how we can engineer better movies.”</p><p name="505e" id="505e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hope buys what he likes, and what he thinks can work, but he’s begun blending social media observation and digital data tracking with gut-level decision-making. He’s an Amazon man now. “I have a personal aesthetic of appreciating noble failures,” he said last summer. “As a student, I learn when it doesn’t work; it helps me as an artist. But I know the audience doesn’t like those, so as an executive, I can’t really go out and try to spend my money on noble failures.”</p><p name="5056" id="5056" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes that results in a Todd Haynes movie. Sometimes it’s a John Cena war flick. And sometimes it’s a remake of a giallo horror classic, like Luca Guadagnino’s upcoming <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/02/amazon-suspiria-remake-berlin-filmnation-luca-guadagnino-dario-argento-tilda-swinton-dakota-johnson-1201899562/" data-href="http://deadline.com/2017/02/amazon-suspiria-remake-berlin-filmnation-luca-guadagnino-dario-argento-tilda-swinton-dakota-johnson-1201899562/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reimagining</a> of Dario Argento’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Suspiria</em>. Movies are still a mystery, a shot in the dark. But some fear that the unknown is evaporating from the equation.</p><p name="9939" id="9939" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have a bunch of young filmmakers who come to me and they say, ‘Hey, I made a movie for $800,000 and people like it and it’s getting a small, theatrical release, which is actually costing me money, and then I made this deal with Netflix for $300,000,’” says Chris Moore. “So the next time they go do it, they figure, that movie was pretty good, everybody seemed to like it, all we got was $300,000 from Netflix, so I got to make the next one for $300,000.”</p><p name="a3c5" id="a3c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as the viewership data is locked for these movies, so are the budgets. The raft of small films that have been bought and paid for by Netflix enforce a new kind of relationship that more closely resembles the old studio-contractor model that employed actors in the 1930s and ’40s: Netflix owns everything. There are no DVD sales, no international receipts, no TV syndication deals. The only difference is the absence of the creative shackles that Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner employed. Swanberg returns to Netflix because he likes what he hears from the company and the financial security it provides. McDowell likes the reach. Blair likes the ease of use. The appeal of Netflix, and its war chest, is incalculable right now.</p><p name="a4cd" id="a4cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ted Sarandos is evasive about the financial impact of spending at will and flooding the market with content. His is a scale-building pursuit, the vision of a seemingly never-ending library, each title opening with its very own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN1jB5UZ650" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN1jB5UZ650" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cherry red, animated Netflix logo</a> at the start.</p><p name="d15c" id="d15c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We don’t spend any time talking about Wall Street when we do content acquisition deals,” Sarandos said last year. “It serves our model probably in the same way it does to make a season of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">House of Cards</em>. It’s about making content that people love, value and associate their Netflix membership with. So when they say, ‘I’m a subscriber to Netflix because I love <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Orange Is the New Black</em>,’ or, ‘I can’t wait to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Crown</em>,’ they know they can’t do it anywhere else.</p><p name="0c16" id="0c16" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Movies, it’s tough to have the same economics because it’s two hours of watching instead of 13 hours. But [the forthcoming Will Smith film] <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bright</em> is a movie that they would have seen in the theater, yet because they’re Netflix members they get to watch it whenever they want, wherever they want, at the same moment. There’s no window, no waiting. The producers will make money, and they chose this over the other models. They didn’t do it because they had a point to prove or they had any interest in Netflix’s value market gap. They did it because this was a more profitable way to make and release movies. Our first ambition is that it becomes like a major studio slate.”</p><p name="0ac4" id="0ac4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For Netflix, that means more, bigger, and wider. But it also means being everything. To be a major movie studio is to serve every so-called quadrant, to market-test and research human interest. And to take chances inside of that research.</p><p name="a548" id="a548" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So when I say I think about it as a slate, I think about it both in volume and scope from a couple of tentpoles, some nice films in the middle, and some great independent,” Sarandos said. “What I’m really excited about is our original films that we’re producing.”</p><p name="3f63" id="3f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Sarandos does provide — what differentiates him from, say, Harvey Weinstein — is full-blown creative control to his filmmakers. Every single filmmaker I’ve spoken with this year has testified to the astonishing freedom the companies provide. “If you disagree with a note from Netflix or Amazon, you can have a creative discussion about it,” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gilmore Girls</em> creator Amy Sherman-Palladino <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-the-monster-thats-eating-hollywood-1490370059" data-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-the-monster-thats-eating-hollywood-1490370059" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently told</a> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Wall Street Journal</em>. “It’s not viewed as, ‘You didn’t take my notes? You’re an enemy and I’m going to cancel your show.’”</p><p name="c5c6" id="c5c6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’ve done this one time and I don’t know if my experience is different from other people’s experience, but from what I saw, the sort of creative freedom that was given to me is a really, really attractive feature to this model,” says Macon Blair. “And also the fact that they can get down with stuff that, for whatever reason — whether it’s the cast or the content or the subject matter — might not be viable for other places.”</p><p name="7448" id="7448" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Netflix closing the door for dozens of theatergoing opportunities is a strange conundrum.

[It’s] also going to be on Netflix, and I can’t say this with any kind of certainty, but I would guess, because the script is very dark and kind of weird and challenging, that Netflix might have been able to confidently take a chance with it in a way that other places wouldn’t. The movie is right in Jeremy’s wheelhouse, so I think fans of his will really enjoy it, but it may not have happened if not for Netflix rolling the dice on it.”</p><p name="7653" id="7653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not everyone is so bullish on the future foretold by this brave new independent cinema.
