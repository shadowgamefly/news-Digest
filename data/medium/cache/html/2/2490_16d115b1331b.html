The incident occurred last night when Arihant was playing games on the handset while charging it at his home at Uday Nagar village, 100 km from here, they said.<br>Police said Arihant has fractured his fingers and also sustained injuries on his face and in eyes due to the blast. He was taken to a private hospital in Indore last night.<br>A doctor treating Arihant said he was out of danger.<br>“However, blood supply to one of his fingers is stopped.

The man’s father found him dead, with scorch marks on his chest. The cause of death was suspected to be electrocution.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">JULY 2013: WOMAN IN CHINA DIES WHILE USING IPHONE 5</strong><br>23-year old Ma Ailun from Xinjiang, China died when she answered a call on her iPhone 5, which was charging at the time. Apple issued an apology , stating, “We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the Ma family. We will fully investigate and cooperate with authorities in this matter.”<br>The woman’s family insisted that, unlike the Thai man’s case above, she was using the original charger, purchased at an Apple store. AppleInsider, however, described the woman’s charger as “an unofficial third-party adapter.” Some reports of the incident point out that woman answered the phone just after getting out of the bath, and that overloads and electrical failures are common in Xinjiang. As The Guardian noted: A current of more than 200mA (0.2A) can be lethal if it passes through the heart. If the charger is not earthed, or if the person taking the call provides a better path for current – say from a damaged wire – then the effect could be lethal. Someone who was wet after a bath might provide just such a pathway for a lethal current.<br>Note that other “debunking” sites have said it isn’t clear if this event ever really occurred, but we feel that Apple’s apology, along with reports by AppleInsider and Reuters, is sufficient confirmation that the incident did in fact happen.</blockquote><blockquote name="e1c5" id="e1c5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">JULY 2013: CHINESE MAN ALLEGEDLY ELECTROCUTED BY IPHONE 4</strong><br>A week after the incident above, a 30-year old man was left<br>comatose after being “suddenly shocked” while plugging in an<br>iPhone 4.

Take, for example, two similar cases in 2014, in which Samsung cell phone users woke in the middle of the night to find their phones smoldering. One incident was that of a 13 year old girl in Texas , while the other was a 25 year old woman in Kent. Samsung has warnings not to smother phones: Covering the device with bedding, your body, thick clothing or any other materials that significantly affect air flow may affect the performance of the phone and poses a possible risk of fire or explosion, which could lead to serious bodily injuries or damage to property. Further, it is recommended not to use non-approved chargers,<br>“Use of a non-Samsung-approved battery or charger may present a risk of fire, explosion, leakage, or other hazard.”<br>As noted above, portable cell phone chargers which are recharged separately and then act as a battery backup, have also had a few isolated cases of explosion in recent months.</blockquote><p name="3065" id="3065" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IS A CELL’S RADIATION 1000 TIMES STRONGER WHEN THE BATTERY IS LOW?</strong><br>Another assertion made in the narrative above is that the boy’s phone exploded due to increased radiation caused by a low battery. This was not part of the original report by The New Indian Times, and was apparently added later to the “warning” which circulated on social media.</p><blockquote name="f41d" id="f41d" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The assertion that a cell phone emits more radiation when the battery is low, however, is incorrect. It is a weak signal that will prompt your mobile phone to work harder, not a weak battery. A CNN article notes, “A weak signal will also cause your phone to work harder, giving off more radiation. So avoid using your phone in elevators, buildings and rural areas. Research shows your device emits more radiation when transmitting than when receiving.”</blockquote><p name="7cb4" id="7cb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Charging while using the phone is in fact not recommended. Because while the phone is charging, whole power is used to charge the phone. That’s why your phone gets charged within the usual time. Usually when the charging is complete, the phones firmware stops the charging process internally (at least in some phones). Also the phones battery comes loaded with a temperature monitor circuit which gives a feedback signal to the phone to stop/adjust charging current if the temperature increases beyond certain limits. But when you use it, power is drawn from the battery and as a result the battery heats up. Still the charger continues to charge it because the battery voltage<br>is below the cutoff. As a result every time you use it when charging, the battery is not getting the full charging power -and it acts like the charger is what feeding the phone literally- so it keeps on charging and also warms up the battery a lot more due to both charging and discharging at the same time.</p><p name="1fbd" id="1fbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it’s a good quality battery, it signals back a temp feedback stopping the charging process even if its still plugged in.</p><p name="3135" id="3135" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s now really important as a matter of fact that we ask ourselves this one salient question “Is my phone more important than my life?”.</p><p name="fb56" id="fb56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, I’ll give you my reply “No, it’s not worth even a tiny itsy bitsy of my surplus flesh talk more of my life”. I don’t know about any one else, but ask yourself this question.</p><p name="9e97" id="9e97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Favour

As the New Indian Express reported :\nA 10-year-old boy from Dewas district was seriously injured when a mobile phone, said to be of Chinese-make, exploded in his hand while\ncharging, police said today. The incident occurred last night when Arihant was playing games on the handset while charging it at his home at Uday Nagar village, 100 km from here, they said.\nPolice said Arihant has fractured his fingers and also sustained injuries on his face and in eyes due to the blast. He was taken to a private hospital in Indore last night.\nA doctor treating Arihant said he was out of danger.\n“However, blood supply to one of his fingers is stopped. If there is no improvement in the condition of that finger, we might have to amputate it”, he added.\n\nNOVEMBER 2013: THAI MAN DIES FROM ALLEGED ELECTROCUTION WHILE CHARGING IPHONE\nAppleInsider reported in November 2013 of a 28-year old Thai man who was reportedly killed while lying shirtless on an iPhone 4s which was charging with a “knockoff third-party” charger. The man’s father found him dead, with scorch marks on his chest. The cause of death was suspected to be electrocution.\n\nJULY 2013: WOMAN IN CHINA DIES WHILE USING IPHONE 5\n23-year old Ma Ailun from Xinjiang, China died when she answered a call on her iPhone 5, which was charging at the time. Apple issued an apology , stating, “We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the Ma family. We will fully investigate and cooperate with authorities in this matter.”\nThe woman’s family insisted that, unlike the Thai man’s case above, she was using the original charger, purchased at an Apple store. AppleInsider, however, described the woman’s charger as “an unofficial third-party adapter.” Some reports of the incident point out that woman answered the phone just after getting out of the bath, and that overloads and electrical failures are common in Xinjiang. As The Guardian noted: A current of more than 200mA (0.2A) can be lethal if it passes through the heart. If the charger is not earthed, or if the person taking the call provides a better path for current – say from a damaged wire – then the effect could be lethal. Someone who was wet after a bath might provide just such a pathway for a lethal current.\nNote that other “debunking” sites have said it isn’t clear if this event ever really occurred, but we feel that Apple’s apology, along with reports by AppleInsider and Reuters, is sufficient confirmation that the incident did in fact happen.","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":62,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""},{"type":1,"start":1031,"end":1108,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""},{"type":1,"start":1416,"end":1467,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""},{"type":2,"start":1031,"end":1108,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""}]},{"name":"e1c5","type":6,"text":"JULY 2013: CHINESE MAN ALLEGEDLY ELECTROCUTED BY IPHONE 4\nA week after the incident above, a 30-year old man was left\ncomatose after being “suddenly shocked” while plugging in an\niPhone 4.
