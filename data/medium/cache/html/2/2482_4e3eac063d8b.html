When he answered, the voice at the other end of the line rang out clear and urgent: “The ocean is boiling.”</p><p name="ff1a" id="ff1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For nearly 24 hours, gas and thick black oil had been bubbling to the water’s surface, and, with each lapping wave, the sludge inched closer to the California coastline. The day before, the workers on an offshore oil rig called Platform A were removing the drill pipe from a freshly bored well when gas and drilling mud erupted onto the platform. Though the crew managed to stopper the top of the well, the highly pressurized gas and oil continued leaking into the water through faults and fractures in the upper layer of the ocean floor.</p><p name="ed62" id="ed62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Platform A was owned and operated by Union Oil, a petroleum company headquartered in nearby El Segundo, California. With no contingency plan and no federal regulations in place, it took Union months to contain the blowout. In all, three million gallons of crude oil spilled out into the Pacific, unfurling across more than 800 square miles of ocean, coating 35 miles of beach, and killing more than 3,600 seabirds and countless marine mammals and fish in the process.</p><p name="81ac" id="81ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Santa Barbarans of all ages mobilized against the profound degradation of their otherwise-pristine seaside city, long known as “The American Riviera.” Demonstrations took many forms: There were the dozens of local protests against Union, which saw residents lashing out at ecological injustice; there were grassroots factions like Get Oil Out!, which distributed pamphlets and bumper stickers and once famously dumped a bucket of oil onto the desk of a Union Oil executive; and there was the lawsuit against Union, filed jointly by the city, county, and state.</p><p name="2268" id="2268" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The blowout — then the largest in United States history — drew global attention,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>too,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>as images of oil-coated marine life circulated in news reports around the world.

For Union Oil, the spill represented a colossal bungle, one exacerbated by its own executives’ apparent callousness. “I am amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few birds,” Union Oil president Fred Hartley infamously said after the spill.</p><p name="fc1c" id="fc1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be a stretch to say the oil spill precipitated the modern environmental movement.

By the 1960s, Union had become the 11th largest oil company in the U.S., with operations around the globe. But the company was struggling to keep up with its larger competitors, due in part to heavy conglomeration in the industry. The federal government had leased some 5,400 acres of the seafloor below Platform A to Union, Texaco Incorporated, Gulf Oil Corporation, Mobil Oil Corporation, and Peter Bawden Drilling Company for more than $61 million (plus royalties on the oil the land produced), and Union was operating the oil rig for the group.</em></p><p name="377d" id="377d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Platform A — one of the early federal offshore rigs in operation — tapped into a reservoir of highly pressurized oil and gas 3,000 feet beneath the ocean floor. Drilling at such depths requires precise procedures to counter the intense pressure from within the Earth to prevent oil and gas from rocketing to the surface uncontrolled. On January 28th, 1969, a blowout occurred when the pressure from below exceeded the pressure applied by Union crews from above. The explosion cracked the seafloor in multiple places; oil continued to slowly seep out even a year later.</em></p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="8084" id="8084" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 49.882%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4eS2dAWrX1Hx64Ay3CE3gw.jpeg" data-width="1772" data-height="1195" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*4eS2dAWrX1Hx64Ay3CE3gw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4eS2dAWrX1Hx64Ay3CE3gw.jpeg"></div></figure><figure name="92ee" id="92ee" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 50.118%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gfBO6-zNZ4NmZobSlYHuzw.jpeg" data-width="1776" data-height="1192" data-is-featured="true" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*gfBO6-zNZ4NmZobSlYHuzw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*gfBO6-zNZ4NmZobSlYHuzw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 199.529%; left: -99.529%;">The water around Platform A appeared to boil as crude oil and gas bubbled to the surface.
