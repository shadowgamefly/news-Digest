Here’s why this draft class should change that way of thinking in 2017.</h2><figure name="04b1" id="04b1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 345px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 49.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wGelDdL_p2FwcHEeiKb-ag.jpeg" data-width="900" data-height="444" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*wGelDdL_p2FwcHEeiKb-ag.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wGelDdL_p2FwcHEeiKb-ag.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="45b9" id="45b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s no fable that in the 2017 NFL Draft, the running back class is easily one of the strongest positional groups overall. So why do many still<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>believe that taking a running back in the first couple of rounds is wasteful? Sure, no one can deny that the NFL is extremely pass heavy these days. QBs take more and more deep shots every year.</p><p name="8223" id="8223" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similar to the NBA, you have power forwards and centers jacking up four three pointers a game which you never saw 10 years ago. The games evolve, teams copycat successful organizations like the Golden State Warriors and their small ball — but to be successful you still need a big guy that can take care of your dirty work. The same trend is in the NFL, teams have tried to copy the pass heavy high scoring offenses of the last decade.</p><p name="fc22" id="fc22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be a consistently successful team you must have a player that can get you 100+ yards any given day and flip the script on the defense, a guy to do the dirty work. You need to run the ball and do it well, so why not invest an early pick in a high profile runner? Even in the modern NFL, numbers show you how important it is to invest in a big time rusher to be successful. Below you can see that six of the 12 1,000 yard rushers in 2016 were in the playoffs, two of those six were Super Bowl participants.</p><figure name="2284" id="2284" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 444px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 63.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4o5WJbs9qHuXqnxYiGI4mg.png" data-width="1072" data-height="680" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*4o5WJbs9qHuXqnxYiGI4mg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4o5WJbs9qHuXqnxYiGI4mg.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">(Pro Football Reference)</figcaption></figure><p name="0bb7" id="0bb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In three of the last five years, at least one of the Super Bowl teams had a 1,000 yard rusher (Super Bowl 50’s leading rusher on the year was Jonathan Stewart with 989 yards in 13 games, effectively a 1,000 yard rusher). You could say having a 1,000 yard rusher on the year gives you an advantage according to recent history.</p><p name="c490" id="c490" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can see an evolution of sorts in the past 49ers, Ravens, Steelers and Seahawks teams with their power running schemes who have all been successful in the last 5–7 years. Guys like Frank Gore, Ray Rice, Le’Veon Bell and Marshawn Lynch come in and change the way defenses play these particular teams. There is no argument that a successful team needs a great quarterback, but your quarterback can’t shoulder the load himself. You <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">need </em>that dangerous running back to take over or compliment your current stable.</p><p name="9214" id="9214" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">While there’s only two backs that are surefire first round picks, there are plenty of running backs in the 2017 draft with great potential. When reading this, keep in mind that this is all about potential, about their best case scenarios, what these guys could be if they get into the right team. If these guys don’t make you want to dedicate your child’s life to being the greatest NFL running back of all time, read it again.</p></div></div></section><section name="02df" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a67a" id="a67a" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Tier 1: The All-Pros</h3><p name="7f84" id="7f84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">These are the players that are making a huge impact on day one, your offense rookie of the year candidates, your round one draft picks.</em></p><h4 name="3e67" id="3e67" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><a href="https://youtu.be/7MKKnCz8OSc" data-href="https://youtu.be/7MKKnCz8OSc" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Leonard Fournette</a>, LSU</h4><p name="fdd6" id="fdd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">NFL Comparison: Adrian Peterson</em></p><figure name="a2bc" id="a2bc" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 557px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 106.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VOqqqu7UIq7cWz-IhXoVdQ.jpeg" data-width="933" data-height="990" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*VOqqqu7UIq7cWz-IhXoVdQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*VOqqqu7UIq7cWz-IhXoVdQ.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="f767" id="f767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’m starting off with a scorcher of a take here: The next Adrian Peterson. The only knock you can scrape up on Fournette are his struggles in the passing game, which is a classy problem. The man is a football player. He can learn to run more precise routes &amp; pass block, especially if he goes to a team with a veteran QB who won’t have it with poor pass blocking in the backfield from such a powerful human being.</p><p name="c69e" id="c69e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At 6&#39;1&quot; 236 pounds with a deadly mix of speed, power and finesse, Fournette may be the most athletically gifted prospect in the draft. Of course he’s got the numbers that don’t lie. In ’15 Fournette rushed for 1,953 yards (3rd in the nation) at 6.5 ypc and 22 touchdowns. His ’16 campaign could be viewed as disappointing having played only seven games due to a nagging ankle injury but still racked up 843 yards at a 6.5 yards per carry. To add to his struggles, when he finally made it back on the field he was forced to compete for carries with breakout star Derrius Guice, who I’ll be raving about just the same about 365 days from now.</p><p name="db26" id="db26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fournette is a bona fide game changer and will display this from the jump. He can easily be the fastest man on the field, and once he’s in the 3rd level he’s definitely the strongest. I mean this play against Texas A&amp;M looks like using that unrealistic truck stick on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Madden ‘08.</em></p><figure name="e169" id="e169" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.10000000000001%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="435" data-height="244" width="435" height="244" src="/media/aa5d253e8540400ec0387046baf714fd?postId=a1f51594a56b" data-media-id="aa5d253e8540400ec0387046baf714fd" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fdt4JHp72KfhdK%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="450b" id="450b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Don’t be shocked if Fournette is drafted in the top five, maybe going to Jacksonville who could stand to add another deminsion to their offense. Fournette could also slide as low down to the Philly/Indy area because of some injury concerns and the aforementioned lack of skill in the passing game which are legitimate concerns. If you’re drafting in the early first round with a hole at running back, you have to roll the dice on Fournette.</p><h4 name="8414" id="8414" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><a href="https://youtu.be/_ne7dWC_eEk" data-href="https://youtu.be/_ne7dWC_eEk" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dalvin Cook</a>, Florida State</h4><p name="32c0" id="32c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">NFL Comparison: Edgerrin James</em></p><figure name="3d4b" id="3d4b" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HsYYoizDGyfZXKAjrMZPSw.jpeg" data-width="534" data-height="401" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*HsYYoizDGyfZXKAjrMZPSw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*HsYYoizDGyfZXKAjrMZPSw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="44d2" id="44d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I would give my life for Edgerrin James, so I don’t take this comparison lightly.

His hands can be questionable at times but he’s a problem for opposing defenses out of the backfield and a very capable deep threat in the passing game as well.</p><p name="e5e8" id="e5e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cook does the small things, too. He’s very patient when running the ball, setting up his blocks. He’s got amazing vision to make great cutbacks all the way across the field to take it home. All this at 6&#39;0&quot; and 215 lbs. He shows up in the big moments, like when he killed a real deal Michigan defense in this past Orange Bowl. He could even evolve into a Marshall Faulk type of guy if all of the pieces fall in his favor, a real utility player. I swear to you when he gets around to the outside and sees a gap, I see a sonic boom shoot from his back as he houses it with 4.3 speed. Cook also bounces off tackles like no other, keeping his legs churning and coming away from a three player pile up with a TD.</p><figure name="3e4e" id="3e4e" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 55.60000000000001%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="435" data-height="242" width="435" height="242" src="/media/530e5748e37403a0c91eb5d79ba9999d?postId=a1f51594a56b" data-media-id="530e5748e37403a0c91eb5d79ba9999d" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FnCku8A3sjRoEE%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="2323" id="2323" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Finding weaknesses in Cook’s game will force you to be nitpicky, he tries to finish runs befoe they’re over on occasion and can be a bit apprehensive when running between the tackles. He does have some fumble concerns, but these are things I would word as areas of improvement, not even weaknesses because they’re so minute. Although in the NFL, he better hold onto that ball like millions of dollars depend on it.</p><h3 name="3f81" id="3f81" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Tier 2: The Pro Bowlers</h3><p name="4419" id="4419" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">These players may need some development in certain areas, but can still be high calliber NFL running backs down the road.

The size (6&#39;1&quot;, 250 lbs.), power and speed are all very similar, but I think Foreman is quicker and a better cut-runner than Lewis was. I also believe that Foreman will be a multiple time pro bowler, this guy has everything you want in a RB, including our first outstanding pass blocker of the post.</p><p name="e4b5" id="e4b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Foreman put up over 2,000 rushing yards in 2016 and led the nation in rush yards per game at 184. He rarely gets tackled behind the line of scrimmage and he’s always falling forward.</p><p name="f336" id="f336" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He needs some work on his decision making between the tackles and his vision when running the ball, basically his running IQ overall. This can be some serious cause for concern and brings guys like Trent Richardson to mind. Great in the NCAA, but your NFL team may not always have the biggest and best offensive lineman available which would require Foreman to run very smart and use vision, decision making and patience.</p><p name="a502" id="a502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Foreman may not always have the giant holes he did at the University of Texas that you could walk an entire third grade class field trip thru.

I believe he is the most day one ready, three down back in the draft. Mixon is an outstanding pass catcher and route runner at 6&#39;1&quot;, 226lbs. Not only are his receiving skills sharp, but he can switch between being a finesse runner to a power runner on the same play with great straight-line speed. When looking at his numbers in 2016 (1,274 yds, 6.5 ypc, 538 rec. yards) it’s important to remember he was half of a two-headed monster with the very talented Samaje Perine. This is a do it all guy, but as anyone knows he’s got some baggage as well.</p><p name="ea27" id="ea27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On-field, Mixon should probably be in the first tier. He can easily be a top 5 running back in the NFL and be a human highlight reel being that he can attack you in the running and passing game.</p><p name="8cdf" id="8cdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Off-field is another story. I’m not here to judge Mixon on his terrible mistake 2 years ago. I don’t know Joe Mixon enough to defend him confidently. I can say that everyone has a mistake in their life that they wish they could take back. The NFL has many policies in place to prevent domestic violence and I think Mixon will have the support to keep his career on the right path. This incident has caused him to miss out on the NFL Combine and will cause his draft stock to plummet which also costs him millions of dollars.</p><p name="739f" id="739f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He made his bed and now he must lie in it. I’m positive Mixon will end up on a NFL roster, and the team that is smart enough to look at his potential as a man and a football player will certainly be reaping the benefits right out of the gate.</p><h3 name="ad7f" id="ad7f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Tier 3: The Long Shots</h3><p name="9770" id="9770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The guys in this category may be one dimensional, have a lot to improve on, or just don’t have something they’re exceptional at doing.

He’s not getting tackled behind the line and he’s not getting taken down by 1 poor, lonesome mortal. You better not tackle him high or he may put up 427 yards like he did in 2014 breaking the NCAA single game rushing record, literally right after Wisconsin’s Melvin Gordon did. Perine is also the all time rushing leader in Oklahoma’s storied history.</p><p name="3f83" id="3f83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I mentioned, Perine is a pure power back and I meant it. Hes not going to make anyone miss, he’s not going to burn you down the sideline. In 2014 and 2015 Perine was 3rd in yards after contact at 1,328. He’s not really a great pass catcher but definitely has potential to be an awesome pass blocker. He’d be great somewhere like Baltimore where he doesn’t have a lot of competition in the back field and will be utilized from the jump.</p><p name="02f1" id="02f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He can play a very similar role as to what New England’s LeGarrette Blount does: get touchdowns.

Maybe I have McCaffery in the wrong category, but I’m not a believer. Although something tells me I shouldn’t leave him out. In the NFL, being undersized doesn’t usually bode well for a running back. McCaffery is 6&#39;0&quot;, 197.</p><p name="9cc2" id="9cc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He needs more weight in my eyes, a running back is taking the hardest of blows in a football game. Much like my theory for RGIII’s failure in the league, I just don’t think McCaffery is build for the punishment he will endure as an every down back. While he doesn’t quite have the skinny, track athlete physique like RGIII, undersized is undersized in my book. Can he really handle getting wrapped up and slammed down by guys like Aaron Donald or Luke Kuechly?</p><p name="8cec" id="8cec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">He is 100% intriguing, I will say. This is a do-it-all offensive player. He can get you yards and touchdowns out of the backfield. He’s an outstanding reciever and returner, Hell, he can probably wash the jerseys better than the equipment crew. McCaffery will be a valuable Swiss Army knife to someone’s toolbox. He could even defy my predictions and be an every down back instead of just a 3rd down guy and live up to the Matt Forte comparison (I sincerelly hope he does). He was an all-time great at Stanford, but the NCAA isn’t the same as the NFL…ask Toby Gerhart.</p></div></div></section><section name="0018" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="ba67" id="ba67" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The NFL is a pass first league and there’s no denying it, that’s the trend. Looking back to the NBA in Milwaukee; their future could be game changing. Building a team around a skilled big guy like Giannis Antetokounmpo, having a young guy who could be another one-of-a-kind like Thon Maker. This combination of skill and size has never been seen and teams can’t seem to matchup well enough to stop it.</p><p name="a26d" id="a26d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are big, skilled lineups going to be the new trend just as small lineups are currently in the NBA? We can see this in the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons, they are matchups nightmares. How do you stop an offense that can kill you in the air and on the ground just as easily? Is it time to build your team like Atlanta and their All-Pro caliber QB, WR and RB? Or is your team going to end up like San Fransicco who could not evolve with the trends and set themsleves back 5 years?</p><p name="148e" id="148e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Moral of the story, if you don’t have a big time running back on your team and you can’t run the ball, the 2017 NFL Draft is the place to fix that. Seize the opportunity for a big time back. Avoid wasting a first or second round pick for an under-qualified passer because you’re desperate for a franchise QB.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="u-paddingTop10"><div

Even in the modern NFL, numbers show you how important it is to invest in a big time rusher to be successful.

Of course he’s got the numbers that don’t lie. In ’15 Fournette rushed for 1,953 yards (3rd in the nation) at 6.5 ypc and 22 touchdowns. His ’16 campaign could be viewed as disappointing having played only seven games due to a nagging ankle injury but still racked up 843 yards at a 6.5 yards per carry.

He could even evolve into a Marshall Faulk type of guy if all of the pieces fall in his favor, a real utility player. I swear to you when he gets around to the outside and sees a gap, I see a sonic boom shoot from his back as he houses it with 4.3 speed.

When looking at his numbers in 2016 (1,274 yds, 6.5 ypc, 538 rec. yards) it’s important to remember he was half of a two-headed monster with the very talented Samaje Perine.

The NFL has many policies in place to prevent domestic violence and I think Mixon will have the support to keep his career on the right path. This incident has caused him to miss out on the NFL Combine and will cause his draft stock to plummet which also costs him millions of dollars.","markups":[]},{"name":"739f","type":1,"text":"He made his bed and now he must lie in it. I’m positive Mixon will end up on a NFL roster, and the team that is smart enough to look at his potential as a man and a football player will certainly be reaping the benefits right out of the gate.","markups":[]},{"name":"ad7f","type":3,"text":"Tier 3: The Long Shots","markups":[]},{"name":"9770","type":1,"text":"The guys in this category may be one dimensional, have a lot to improve on, or just don’t have something they’re exceptional at doing.

He’s not getting tackled behind the line and he’s not getting taken down by 1 poor, lonesome mortal. You better not tackle him high or he may put up 427 yards like he did in 2014 breaking the NCAA single game rushing record, literally right after Wisconsin’s Melvin Gordon did. Perine is also the all time rushing leader in Oklahoma’s storied history.","markups":[]},{"name":"3f83","type":1,"text":"As I mentioned, Perine is a pure power back and I meant it. Hes not going to make anyone miss, he’s not going to burn you down the sideline. In 2014 and 2015 Perine was 3rd in yards after contact at 1,328. He’s not really a great pass catcher but definitely has potential to be an awesome pass blocker. He’d be great somewhere like Baltimore where he doesn’t have a lot of competition in the back field and will be utilized from the jump.","markups":[]},{"name":"02f1","type":1,"text":"He can play a very similar role as to what New England’s LeGarrette Blount does: get touchdowns.

McCaffery is 6'0\", 197.","markups":[]},{"name":"9cc2","type":1,"text":"He needs more weight in my eyes, a running back is taking the hardest of blows in a football game. Much like my theory for RGIII’s failure in the league, I just don’t think McCaffery is build for the punishment he will endure as an every down back. While he doesn’t quite have the skinny, track athlete physique like RGIII, undersized is undersized in my book. Can he really handle getting wrapped up and slammed down by guys like Aaron Donald or Luke Kuechly?","markups":[]},{"name":"8cec","type":1,"text":"He is 100% intriguing, I will say. This is a do-it-all offensive player. He can get you yards and touchdowns out of the backfield. He’s an outstanding reciever and returner, Hell, he can probably wash the jerseys better than the equipment crew. McCaffery will be a valuable Swiss Army knife to someone’s toolbox. He could even defy my predictions and be an every down back instead of just a 3rd down guy and live up to the Matt Forte comparison (I sincerelly hope he does). He was an all-time great at Stanford, but the NCAA isn’t the same as the NFL…ask Toby Gerhart.","markups":[]},{"name":"ba67","type":1,"text":"The NFL is a pass first league and there’s no denying it, that’s the trend.
