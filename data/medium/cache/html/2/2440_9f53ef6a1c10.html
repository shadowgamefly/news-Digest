I was standing 15 feet from the scene beside Officer Kaur, a stocky female of South Asian complexion. She turned to me and abruptly said that I was not needed as a witness and should leave immediately.

Ben was still supporting Rebecca’s back when Sgt. Espinoza and Officer Gabriel grabbed him from behind without warning, putting him in an arm lock and jerked him backwards over the pavement. They told him sternly that he had to leave now that trained medical professionals had arrived, implying that he was interfering and justifying their violent actions. The officers dragged him across the sidewalk, propping him against the building.

The sirens and emergency vehicles, the sudden arrival of over half a dozen uniformed personnel, two of whom had grabbed my friend, transformed an intimate street scene into something chaotic. Officer Kaur shouted at me to cross the street. It was very sudden and I was, admittedly, in shock. I stammered that I intended to head home, but that my friend was over there. I pointed at Ben against the wall, and said I’d like to take him home with me.</p></div></div></section><section name="3acc" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b9af" id="b9af" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Arrested</strong></p><p name="17b1" id="17b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without warning, I was shoved from behind by Officer Gerrans and then collectively tackled by Officers Gerrans, Kaur and Andreotti.

If this were indeed the case, I said, I would agree. But I hadn’t interfered with the medical response, nor could I have. I was 15 feet away from Rebecca and Josh when I was tackled. I had good intentions, I said. I had called 911 and was following the operator’s instructions to remain on the scene until the ambulance arrived. That was all.</p><p name="76ab" id="76ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The small talk continued. They said I had nothing to worry about. I had done the right thing. I’d probably be taken to the police station around the corner and released. I asked whether I should communicate this to Ben or other friends, in case I needed help getting bailed out. They said that this process should be quick, quicker than my friends’ ability to help, and that I’d be out in no time.</p><p name="1cd7" id="1cd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I took them at their word.

The toilet was a hole in the ground, no toilet paper. The hole dropped down a few feet where it was intersected by a grate of prison bars.

Even one’s feces left prison upon evacuation, presumably to leave the subject without anything to play with.</p><p name="8a6a" id="8a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I say this, because while the room was dirty, it was not as dirty as the next two cells I experienced the following day, which were smeared with feces and peanut butter. Approximately every 6 hours, a pushcart made its way around the prison with regulation peanut butter sandwiches. Only a fraction were consumed. Many were used for wall decoration or splattered against the ceiling.</p><figure name="d4eb" id="d4eb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eLzprZ4z7n2utvpLAKO8gA.jpeg" data-width="750" data-height="1000" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*eLzprZ4z7n2utvpLAKO8gA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eLzprZ4z7n2utvpLAKO8gA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">I couldn’t bear to eat, so I took my rations home as a souvenir.
