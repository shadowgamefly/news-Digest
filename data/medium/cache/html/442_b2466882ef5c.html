The first is that movie makers usually just aren’t sensitive to the “science texture” of their movies. They can tell if things are out of whack at a human level, but they typically can’t tell if something is scientifically off. Sometimes they’ll get as far as calling a local university for help, but too often they’re sent to a hyper-specialized academic who’ll not-very-usefully tell them their whole story is wrong. Of course, to be fair, science content usually doesn’t make or break movies.

It’s fun for an “actual scientist” like me to come up with stuff like this. It’s kind of liberating.

I’m sprinkling in a few stories I heard from <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=richard+feynman" data-href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=richard+feynman" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a> about “doing physics in the field” on the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=manhattan+project" data-href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=manhattan+project" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Manhattan Project</a>.

And it turns out that the way the script is written right then, Jeremy is actually supposed to be on camera using Wolfram Language himself (just like — I’m happy to say — so many real-life physicists do).</p><p name="48f5" id="48f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Christopher shows some of the code he’s written for the movie, and how the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/InteractiveManipulation.html" data-href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/InteractiveManipulation.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controls to make the dynamics work</a>.

So then how should we start communicating with them? We need something universal that doesn’t depend on the details of human language or human history. Well, OK, if you’re right there with the aliens, there are physical objects to point to. (Yes, that assumes the aliens have some notion of discrete objects, rather than just a continuum, but by the time they’ve got spaceships and so on, that seems like a decently safe bet.) But what if you want to be more abstract?</p><p name="5f86" id="5f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, then there’s always mathematics. But is mathematics actually universal? Does anyone who builds spaceships necessarily have to know about prime numbers, or integrals, or Fourier series? It’s certainly true that in our human development of technology, those are things we’ve needed to understand. But are there other (and perhaps better) paths to technology? I think so.</p><p name="845c" id="845c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me, the most general form of abstraction that seems relevant to the actual operation of our universe is what we get by looking at the <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html" data-href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">computational universe of possible programs</a>.

But so do an infinite diversity of other abstract collections of rules. And what I realized a while back is that many of these are very relevant — and actually very good — for <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.11" data-href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.11" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">producing technology</a>.</p><p name="3f01" id="3f01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, OK, if we look across the computational universe of possible programs, what might we pick out as reasonable universals to start an abstract discussion with aliens who’ve come to visit us?</p><p name="0e6d" id="0e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once one can point to discrete objects, one has the potential to start talking about numbers, first in unary, then perhaps in binary. Here’s the beginning of a notebook I made about this for the movie. The words and code are for human consumption; for the aliens there’d just be “flash cards” of the main graphics:</p><figure name="9183" id="9183" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 649px; max-height: 921px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 141.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GrIIW5XzgR4ezXL98uXD4w.png" data-width="649" data-height="921" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GrIIW5XzgR4ezXL98uXD4w.png"></div></figure><p name="d392" id="d392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">OK, so after basic numbers, and maybe some arithmetic, what’s next? It’s interesting to realize that even what we’ve discussed so far doesn’t reflect the history of human mathematics: despite how fundamental they are (as well as their appearance in very old traditions like the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=i+ching" data-href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=i+ching" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I Ching</em></a>) binary numbers only got popular quite recently — long after lots of much-harder-to-explain mathematical ideas.</p><p name="85ec" id="85ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, OK, we don’t need to follow the history of human mathematics or science — or, for that matter, the order in which it’s taught to humans.

To ask a question like “what is your purpose on Earth?” one has to go a lot further than just talking about things like binary sequences or cellular automata. It’s a very interesting problem, and one that’s strangely analogous to something that’s becoming very important right now in the world: <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/" data-href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">communicating with AIs</a>, and defining what <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/" data-href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">goals or purposes they should have</a> (notably “be nice to the humans”).</p><p name="abf5" id="abf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, AIs are a little like alien intelligences, right now, here on Earth. The only intelligence we really understand so far is human intelligence. But inevitably every example we see of it shares all the details of the human condition and of human history. So what is intelligence like when it doesn’t share those details?</p><p name="325a" id="325a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, one of the things that’s emerged from basic science I’ve done is that there <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.10" data-href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.10" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn’t really a bright line</a> between the “intelligent” and the merely “computational.” Things like cellular automata — or the weather — are doing things just as complex as our brains. But even if in some sense they’re “thinking.” they’re not doing so in human-like ways. They don’t share our context and our details.</p><p name="ccd8" id="ccd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if we’re going to “communicate” about things like purpose, we’ve got to find some way to align things. In the AI case, I’ve in fact been working on creating what I call a “<a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/" data-href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">symbolic discourse language</a>” that’s a way of expressing concepts that are important to us humans, and communicating them to AIs.

And there are long-term goals, like defining some analog of a “constitution” for how AIs should generally behave.</p><p name="8eda" id="8eda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, in communicating with aliens, we’ve got to build up a common “universal” language that allows us to express concepts that are important to us. That’s not going to be easy. Human natural languages are based on the particulars of the human condition and the history of human civilization.

Well, purpose is not really something that can be defined abstractly. It’s really something that can be defined only relative to a whole historical and cultural framework.

And it’s clear there are some similarities — as well as lots of differences.</p><p name="e76f" id="e76f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both involve all sorts of ideas and creativity. Both involve pulling together lots of different kinds of skills. Both have to have everything fit together to make a coherent product in the end.</p><p name="ca74" id="ca74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In some ways I think movie makers have it easier than us software developers. After all, they just have to make one thing that people can watch. In software — and particularly in language design — we have to make something that different people can use in an infinite diversity of different ways, including ones we can’t directly foresee. Of course, in software you always get to make new versions that incrementally improve things; in movies you just get one shot.</p><p name="40ed" id="40ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in terms of human resources, there are definitely ways software has it easier than a movie like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em>. Well-managed software development tends to have a somewhat steady rhythm, so one can have consistent work going on, with consistent teams, for years. In making a movie like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em> one’s usually bringing in a whole sequence of people — who might never even have met before — each for a very short time. To me, it’s amazing this can work at all. But I guess over the years many of the tasks in the movie industry have become standardized enough that someone can be there for a week or two and do something, then successfully hand it on to another person.</p><p name="9079" id="9079" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve led a few dozen major software releases in my life. And one might think that by now I’d have got to the point where doing a software release would just be a calm and straightforward process. But it never is. Perhaps it’s because we’re always trying to do majorly new and innovative things. Or perhaps it’s just the nature of such projects. But I’ve found that to get the project done to the quality level I want always requires a remarkable degree of personal intensity. Yes, at least in the case of our company, there are always extremely talented people working on the project. But somehow there are always things to do that nobody expected, and it takes a lot of energy, focus and pushing to get them all together.</p><p name="40d2" id="40d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At times, I’ve imagined that the process might be a little like making a movie. And in fact in the <a href="http://mathematica25.com/" data-href="http://mathematica25.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early years of Mathematica</a>, for example, we even used to have “software credits” that looked very much like movie credits — except that the categories of contributors were things that often had to be made up by me (“lead package developers,” “expression formatting,” “lead font designer” …). But after a decade or so, recognizing the patchwork of contributions to different versions just became too complex, and so we had to give up on software credits. Still, for a while I thought we’d try having “wrap parties,” just like for movies. But somehow when the scheduled party came around, there was always some critical software issue that had come up, and the key contributors couldn’t come to the party because they were off fixing it.</p><p name="a8d4" id="a8d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software development — or at least language development — also has some structural similarities to movie making. One starts from a script — an overall specification of what one wants the finished product to be like. Then one actually tries to build it. Then, inevitably, at the end when one looks at what one has, one realizes one has to change the specification. In movies like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em>, that’s post-production. In software, it’s more an iteration of the development process.</p><p name="e673" id="e673" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was interesting to me to see how the script and the suggestions I made for it propagated through the making of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em>. It reminded me quite a lot of how I, at least, do software design: everything kept on getting simpler. I’d suggest some detailed way to fix a piece of dialogue. “You shouldn’t say [the Amy Adams character] flunked calculus; she’s way too analytical for that.” “You shouldn’t say the spacecraft came a million light years; that’s outside the galaxy; say a trillion miles instead.” The changes would get made. But then things would get simpler, and the core idea would get communicated in some more minimal way. I didn’t see all the steps (though that would have been interesting). But the results reminded me quite a lot of the process of software design I’ve done so many times — cut out any complexity one can, and make everything as clear and minimal as possible.</p><figure name="2a5d" id="2a5d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 12px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 1.7999999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" data-width="800" data-height="14" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png"></div></figure><h4 name="980c" id="980c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Can You Write a Whiteboard?</h4><p name="af76" id="af76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">My contributions to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em> were mostly concentrated around the time the movie was shooting early in the summer of 2015.

Still, they’re actually fairly tame compared to “full physics-speak.” But let me explain a bit of the “physics story” on the whiteboard.</p><p name="223f" id="223f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It starts from an obvious feature of the spacecraft: it’s rather unusual, asymmetrical shape. It looks a bit like one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattleback" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattleback" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rattleback tops</a> that one can start spinning one way, but then it changes direction. So I thought: maybe the spacecraft spins around. Well, any massive (non-spherical) object spinning around will produce gravitational waves. Usually they’re absurdly too weak to detect, but if the object is sufficiently massive or spins sufficiently rapidly, they can be substantial. And indeed, late last year, after a 30-year odyssey, gravitational waves from two <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/02/black-hole-tech/" data-href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/02/black-hole-tech/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">black holes spinning around and merging were detected</a> — and they were sufficiently intense to detect from a third of the way across the universe. (Accelerating masses effectively generate gravitational waves like accelerating electric charges generate electromagnetic waves.)</p><p name="1062" id="1062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OK, so let’s imagine the spacecraft somehow spins rapidly enough to generate lots of gravitational waves. And what if we could somehow confine those gravitational waves in a small region, maybe even by using the motion of the spacecraft itself? Well, then the waves would interfere with themselves. But what if the waves got coherently amplified, like in a laser? Well, then the waves would get stronger, and they’d inevitably start having a big effect on the motion of the spacecraft — like perhaps pushing it through spacetime.</p><p name="1317" id="1317" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But why should the gravitational waves get amplified? In an ordinary laser that uses photons (“particles of light”), one basically needs to continually make new photons by pumping energy into a material. Photons are so-called Bose–Einstein particles (“bosons”) which means that they tend to all “do the same thing” — which is why the light in a laser comes out as a coherent wave. (Electrons are fermions, which means that they try never to do the same thing, leading to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exclusion Principle</a> that’s crucial in making matter stable, etc.)</p><p name="cf67" id="cf67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as light waves can be thought of as made up of photons, so gravitational waves can most likely be thought of as made up of gravitons (though, to be fair, we don’t yet have any fully consistent theory of gravitons). Photons don’t interact directly with each other — basically because photons interact with things like electrons that have electric charge, but photons themselves don’t have electric charge. Gravitons, on the other hand, do interact directly with each other — basically because they interact with things that have any kind of energy, and they themselves can have energy.</p><p name="d111" id="d111" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These kinds of nonlinear interactions can have wild effects. For example, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gluon" data-href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gluon" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gluons</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">QCD</a> have nonlinear interactions that have the effect of keeping them permanently confined inside the particles like protons that they keep “glued” together. It’s not at all clear what nonlinear interactions of gravitons might do. The idea here is that perhaps they’d lead to some kind of self-sustaining “graviton laser.”</p><p name="84de" id="84de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The formulas at the top of the whiteboard are basically about the generation and effects of gravitational waves. The ones at the bottom are mostly about gravitons and their interactions. The formulas at the top are basically all associated with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (which for 100 years has been the theory of gravity used in physics). The formulas at the bottom give a mixture of classical and quantum approaches to gravitons and their interactions. The diagrams are so-called Feynman diagrams, in which wavy lines schematically represent gravitons propagating through spacetime.</p><p name="1573" id="1573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no real idea if a “graviton laser” is possible, or how it would work. But in an ordinary photon laser, the photons always effectively bounce around inside some kind of cavity whose walls act as mirrors. Unfortunately, however, we don’t know how to make a graviton mirror — just like we don’t know any way of making something that will shield a gravitational field (well, dark matter sort of would, if it actually exists). For the whiteboard, I made the speculation that perhaps there’s some weird way of making a “metamaterial” down at the Planck scale of 10–34 meters (where quantum effects in gravity basically have to become important) that could act as a graviton mirror. (Another possibility is that a graviton laser could work more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-electron_laser" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-electron_laser" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free-electron laser</a> without a cavity as such.)</p><p name="e4e1" id="e4e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, remember, my idea with the whiteboard was to write what I thought a typical good physicist, say plucked from a government lab, might think about if confronted with the situation in the movie. It’s more “conventional” than the theory I personally came up with for how to make an interstellar spacecraft. But that’s because my theory depends on a bunch of my own ideas about how fundamental physics works, that aren’t yet mainstream in the physics community.</p><p name="6f72" id="6f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s the correct theory of interstellar travel? Needless to say, I don’t know. I’d be amazed if either the main theory I invented for the movie or the theory on the whiteboard were correct as they stand. But who knows? And of course it’d be extremely helpful if some aliens showed up in interstellar spaceships to even show us that interstellar travel is possible…</p><figure name="c9c6" id="c9c6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 12px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 1.7999999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" data-width="800" data-height="14" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png"></div></figure><h4 name="229e" id="229e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">What Is Your Purpose on Earth?</h4><p name="e2e7" id="e2e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If aliens show up on Earth, one of the obvious big questions is: why are you here? What is your purpose? It’s something the characters in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em> talk about a lot. And when Christopher and I were visiting the set we were asked to make a list of possible answers, that could be put on a whiteboard or a clipboard. Here’s what we came up with:</p><figure name="8178" id="8178" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 634px; max-height: 691px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 109.00000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Z0GZ8w2y9daVvZq65Y6HcQ.png" data-width="634" data-height="691" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z0GZ8w2y9daVvZq65Y6HcQ.png"></div></figure><p name="b531" id="b531" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As I mentioned before, the whole notion of purpose is something that’s very tied into cultural and other context. And it’s interesting to think about what purposes one would have put on this list at different times in human history. It’s also interesting to imagine what purposes humans — or AIs — might give for doing things in the future. Perhaps I’m too pessimistic but I rather expect that for future humans, AIs, and aliens, the answer will very often be something out there in the computational universe of possibilities — that we today aren’t even close to having words or concepts for.</p><figure name="b7c5" id="b7c5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 12px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 1.7999999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg.png" data-width="800" data-height="14" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg.png"></div></figure><h4 name="fc9d" id="fc9d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">And Now It’s a Movie…</h4><p name="30aa" id="30aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The movie came together really well, the early responses look great…and it’s fun to see things like this (yes, that’s Christopher’s code):</p><figure name="c9cd" id="c9cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 35.699999999999996%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME width="700" height="250" src="/media/5babb80f1c08e1ad8488053df5f788c3?postId=b2466882ef5c" data-media-id="5babb80f1c08e1ad8488053df5f788c3" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FCwwXrqpXUAA_61J.jpg%3Athumb&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="8788" id="8788" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s been interesting and stimulating to be involved with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Arrival</em>.
