When the undisputed King of Cool decided to implement near-absolute creative control over his movie career, he and veteran producer Robert Relyea established Solar Productions in 1966.</p><p name="e0a3" id="e0a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The resounding critical and commercial success of the action-packed, Solar-sanctioned <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bullitt</em> two years later may well have given McQueen the ultimate incentive to fashion a character study with modest box office aspirations that he would not appear in.</p><p name="07e9" id="07e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After an arduous audition process that saw somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 young women vying for the coveted part of high school cheerleader “Jerri Jo Hopper,” McQueen personally hand-picked Purcell as one of the fresh-faced stars of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M</em>.</p><p name="5469" id="5469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Auditioning multiple times, requesting an unheard-of second script read through after leaving the building, cutting her long, parted straight down the middle Hippie hairstyle into ostentatious bangs, conquering the small town Missouri dialect, and memorizing the entire script no doubt proved McQueen’s decision to cast the ballsy, determined actress was right on the money.</p><p name="306a" id="306a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Michael Douglas, in only his second major screen appearance, rendered the California cool, albeit spiritually unfulfilled college semantics professor Adam Gaines, who drives cross country in a cherry red Porsche 911 to reconnect with his family origins in Missouri.</p><p name="eb15" id="eb15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While not exactly penning a glowing review, the New York Times’ Vincent Canby reserved notable praise for Purcell’s screen debut, saying that the ingénue “is absolutely right, down to the slightest pout, as ‘Jerri Jo,’ the kind of girl who doesn’t think you should go all the way on a first date.”</p><p name="5989" id="5989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The review must have given McQueen immense satisfaction. One year before the film’s September 1970 release, he prudently revealed while introducing Purcell before a packed press conference at Solar’s Studio City corporate offices that “there’s a basic honesty and believability in Lee…I think this girl and the picture are both going to be hits.”</p><p name="400c" id="400c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Purcell has acted in countless films and television over a distinguished 50-year career, encompassing Peggy in the cult surfing classic <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Big Wednesday</em>, Susan in the hilarious Gene Wilder-Richard Pryor mash-up <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Stir Crazy</em>, seductive step-mom Beth in Nicolas Cage’s career-making <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Valley Girl</em>, strong-willed state’s attorney Louise St. Laurent in the award-winning <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Due South</em> series, and Francine Gingerfield, the sole surviving world political leader in the horror comedy <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kids vs. Monsters </em>costarring Malcolm McDowell.</p><p name="dc39" id="dc39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The supremely gifted actress is eternally grateful that her life’s journey intertwined with the King of Cool.

The path which led me to Steve was an odd series of events, in so many ways. I had not done a film before and didn’t even have a theatrical agent when I was cast in his film <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M</em>.</p><p name="7fd1" id="7fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the time, I was studying acting, and modeling through my agent, Nina Blanchard, and I also had a commercial agent, Bill Cunningham. One day, Bill called and told me I should audition for a film, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M., </em>that Steve McQueen’s company, Solar Productions, was doing.</p><p name="da85" id="da85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Getting a film audition through a commercial agent is not the customary way of doing business, since commercial agents do not represent actors for films. It was extremely odd for Bill to know about this film and to be able to get me an audition for it.</p><p name="67af" id="67af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What might seem even more odd to people was that I<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> turned down</em> the audition, as I didn’t feel I was ready to audition for a starring role. However, Bill was persistent, and he kept calling me about it and finally convinced me I should read the script anyway. So, I did, and I thought Bill was right.</p><p name="550f" id="550f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another odd note was that I’d also been studying Standard American Speech with Professor Morris Cohen. Through hard work and practice, I had finally managed to get rid of my stutter, learn proper voice placement, and accent-free diction, instead of the hodge-podge of accents that I originally had.</p><p name="f160" id="f160" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then, of course, the first thing Bill told me to do for the audition was to go back to Prof. Cohen to learn an authentic Missouri accent. I didn’t know at the time that I was about to embark on a series of nerve-wracking auditions over a period of months and that my life was about to completely change for the better.</p><p name="881a" id="881a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Were you very cognizant of McQueen’s career when you first met?</strong></p><p name="7d74" id="7d74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another odd, but strangely advantageous situation, was that I wasn’t very familiar with Steve, as he was of my parents’ generation. I’m not sure I had even seen any of his films at the time.</p><p name="e3d1" id="e3d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That turned out to be a good thing, as I had absolutely no intimidation when I met him. If I had really known how huge a global movie star he was, I probably would have been a nervous wreck. He was the biggest star in the world at the time.</p><figure name="816f" id="816f" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 753px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 143.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2U6vjA2NiLpJ2H6MXle6rw.jpeg" data-width="864" data-height="1239" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*2U6vjA2NiLpJ2H6MXle6rw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*2U6vjA2NiLpJ2H6MXle6rw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Just before signing up for a brief stint on NBC’s science fiction-soaked “Persons Unknown” 2010 drama, Lee Purcell is captured in an appealing studio portrait.

This was about 20 years after the old, very expensive, star-grooming studio system had been abolished and the new system was a completely different model.</p><p name="f295" id="f295" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though we received no grooming or lessons or any of the perks that earlier generations of actors in the studio systems had received, it was still very advantageous in that we got to be on film and received a “pedigree” in that Fox, Columbia, Universal or Screen Gems, etc. had given their stamp of approval to us.</p><p name="c0c7" id="c0c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of us who have gone on to have lengthy careers were in these New Talent programs: me, Tom Selleck, the late Farrah Fawcett, Sharon Gless, etc.</p><p name="0edb" id="0edb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before I was signed to the Screen Gems program, I told them that I was already in the audition process for this new film, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M.,</em> and asked to have that one film excluded from my deal, and to please have a legal way out of the overall contract without penalty.</p><p name="1a26" id="1a26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They surprisingly agreed, and they started me out with one line in one episode in one of their TV series [<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Author’s Note</em>: Starring Eleanor Parker, Peter Haskell, and Leslie Nielsen as the titular character, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bracken’s World</em> was a short-lived series about a powerful Hollywood studio mogul and his bevy of gorgeous starlets that is perhaps best known for replacing the iconic <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Trek</em> in NBC’s fall lineup. In a case of life imitating art, Purcell was cast as a young acting student in the “Don’t You Cry for Susannah” episode, broadcast on October 10, 1969].</p><p name="2d76" id="2d76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since my <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M.</em> series of auditions went on for a long time, this was all happening simultaneously.

Steve and his Solar Productions had their beautifully decorated offices there. Steve parked his car in the back, the same place where I was told to park mine. He never demanded a special parking place or a valet. He just parked his own car.</p><p name="14df" id="14df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The audition process was long and grueling, as it was a culling and winnowing process of many, many actresses. If I recall correctly, I had five auditions as I worked my way up the ladder to receive the final screen test. There were around 500 women who auditioned for the role of “Jerri Jo Hopper,” because everybody in town, and nationwide, whether they were known or unknown, was seen for that role.</p><p name="bdfc" id="bdfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We would audition, and then either be eliminated or make it to the next round — think <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">American Idol</em>, but with no salary, no fame, no perks and no screen time unless you got the job — then the remaining actresses would get notes from the director, Bob Scheerer, and return days or weeks later to go the next round.</p><p name="83a1" id="83a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember after my first, maybe second, audition, on my way out of the building, I had a different idea as to how to do the scene, so I spun around, went back in, and asked to read again. Another actress was already in the audition room reading, so I had to wait.</p><p name="2ce6" id="2ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Asking to read again was unheard of, but they let me read again. When I got the role later, I was told that I had saved myself from early elimination by having the courage to do that, and by then delivering a better reading.</p><p name="ece1" id="ece1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I moved on to the next round. Time passed, and the process went on and on, more actresses were eliminated, and I managed to hang in there. I was still tied to Screen Gems, but they had agreed to release me entirely if I got the film.</p><p name="3b4b" id="3b4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was incredibly generous of SG, as it meant I would not be a loan-out to Solar, so SG would not collect my salary from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam</em>, and I would get my entire salary from the film. Of course, I would have done the film for free and worked for free for Screen Gems as well!</p><p name="aebb" id="aebb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day, thinking about the role, I was pondering myself in the mirror and thought “This is not the hairstyle that ‘Jerri Jo Hopper’ would wear.” I had the popular hairstyle of the day, very long, parted straight down the middle, standard hippie-actress style.</p><p name="5b02" id="5b02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, the character in the film was a small-town Missouri high school cheerleader. So, I grabbed the scissors and chopped off my hair and cut thick, chunky bangs. When I went in for the next audition, everyone got so excited about my new look, even though it was a very bad haircut!</p><p name="4e2b" id="4e2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By changing my hair, I suddenly embodied the character and had also differentiated myself from the rest of the remaining actresses. In addition to that, I kept working and working on the role, the Missouri accent, and all the scenes. By the time I finished with the auditions, I had the entire script memorized, including all of the screen directions and everyone’s lines, not just mine.</p><figure name="bb49" id="bb49" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 728px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 138.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jwAB9uwKjoQHz5PDGcoxLw.jpeg" data-width="1810" data-height="2509" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*jwAB9uwKjoQHz5PDGcoxLw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*jwAB9uwKjoQHz5PDGcoxLw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">In between starring in “The Reivers” and “Le Mans,” 39-year-old Steve McQueen opted to produce “Adam at 6 A.M,” directed by television journeyman Robert Scheerer.

Early in the process, perhaps after one general audition or so, I received a call on a Saturday morning from someone at Solar Productions. I had just come in from gardening, and I was grimy and dirty, and they told me to come over right away. I lived nearby.</p><p name="c44c" id="c44c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I said, “Can I at least take a shower?” and they said, “No, come right now.” I didn’t think much of it. I thought I was just going in to probably pick up some more script pages — no email in those days; you had to drive somewhere to pick up anything; unless you were a big star, then the pages would be delivered — from the reception desk and wouldn’t even see anyone.</p><p name="006b" id="006b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I grabbed my car keys and went with dirty nails and dirty gardening clothes, and little did I know it, but this was to be my introduction to Steve McQueen. He didn’t care; he was so down to earth. He wasn’t like other people. The earthier and grittier you were, the happier he was.</p><p name="ad80" id="ad80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, I didn’t have the role, but I thought I might have a chance since Steve wanted to meet me. He and I just chatted and chatted, and he didn’t make me feel as if I was being interviewed or judged. He would ask me interesting questions that had nothing to do with the role or the film.</p><p name="b132" id="b132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What kind of interesting questions are we talking about?</strong></p><p name="e152" id="e152" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, Steve wanted to know whether other women liked me. I replied, “I don’t think so.” Such naïveté on my part to give such an answer, but I was young. He must have liked the answer, as he later quoted it to the press.</p><p name="9ae1" id="9ae1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have always thought he asked it to test my honesty, as he was always testing people’s honesty. He was so easy to talk to that I was completely honest about everything.</p><p name="f511" id="f511" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Steve also asked me about my upbringing, motorcycle, and cars, not just shallow, social questions that one asks to be conversational. His questions were more personal and insightful.</p><figure name="e431" id="e431" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 373px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 93.30000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YUS0BLfhVGRdA_M3osKz-g.jpeg" data-width="400" data-height="373" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*YUS0BLfhVGRdA_M3osKz-g.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Steve McQueen and beaming apprentice Lee Purcell hang out inside the King of Cool’s Solar offices in Studio City, California — site of the old Republic B-Western studios — after announcing the production of “Adam at 6 A.M.” circa September 19, 1969.

I think it was a Porsche, and it had a very loud engine. He was yelling over the engine, and I would have to yell back my response.

It was a huge bike for me, as I was a skinny girl, but I had gotten a really good deal on it. Steve thought it was absolutely hilarious that I was riding this huge bike!

It was a “feet to the fire” sort of experience. They had narrowed the field down from 500 actresses to a handful. What’s odd is that they crammed us all in the same car — hip-to-hip in the back seat — all competitors, and took us to a movie studio ranch.</p><p name="0db6" id="0db6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of these nervous young ladies were sitting in the back seat of this car, and in the front seat were the very nice producers Rick Rosenberg and Bob Christiansen. All I could do was bravado my way through it or act nervous, and I really wasn’t all that nervous but more shell-shocked. So, I chose bravado.</p><p name="9588" id="9588" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember Rick Rosenberg turned around, looking at us young hopefuls jammed in the back, and he was making small talk, being very kind. When he asked me, “How are you doing, Lee? Are you nervous?” I said, “I’m not nervous. I’ve already packed my bags to go do the film.”</p><p name="7ca0" id="7ca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Needless to say, there was shocked silence. It was just bravado…my bags weren’t packed, but I just needed to say or do something to show that I was strong and confident.</p><p name="b1fd" id="b1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We arrived to an open ranch area that was very beautiful, where a lot of exteriors for movies were shot, to shoot our scenes with the handsome young actors. What was really strange was that we shot our scenes outside while the other actresses just stood around and watched until it was their turn.</p><p name="f949" id="f949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Normally, one waits in a waiting room or a green room. But, this was a ranch, so there was nowhere to wait, nor anywhere to sit. So, everyone had to lean on trees or sit on fallen logs when they weren’t on camera as there wasn’t anywhere else to sit once you were out of the car.

When they did, I said “You’re speaking to ‘Jerri Jo Hopper.’ I got the part!” It was such a moment. You only have a moment like that once as an actress. That first break is something you never forget. Everything else is gravy, but that first break is magical.</p><p name="4a9d" id="4a9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now that I had the role, Steve began to mentor me in earnest, as he tried to prepare me for the film and the press. He was such a multi-tasker, as he was planning the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Le Mans</em> film at the same time, had a family, the production company, and other films and a million other things.</p><p name="2db5" id="2db5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, he still found the time to be very involved mentoring me and planning how I should look. He made me gain weight and do my hair a different tone of blond, and he sent me to a person who cut hair, to fix what I had hacked at!</p><p name="4b38" id="4b38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He even taught me exercises that he’d learned from his personal trainer — whom I learned years later was Bruce Lee — as he wanted me to be toned, while I gained the 15 pounds he thought I needed.</p><p name="deed" id="deed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They hadn’t cast the lead male role yet, which is very unusual. It’s more common to hire the male lead first, but in this case, they hired me, the female lead, first. I don’t know why.

Was he similar to his cool, stoic, tough guy movie persona?</strong></p><p name="0cac" id="0cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My memory of him is very different from the roles he so brilliantly played. Steve was very kind to me and very helpful. He knew I knew nothing from nothing, so he wanted to help me live through the publicity fire-storm that was coming as a result of his having cast me personally. And, it was a firestorm!</p><p name="5c96" id="5c96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also liked me because I rode motorcycles and liked fast cars. We had a lot in common. I think we recognized each other as kindred souls, and he always said I was a rebel like him.</p><p name="a5b1" id="a5b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He told me a few things about his background, no big secrets or anything, but enough to let me know that we both followed a similar path in life, even though from outward appearances it probably seemed to some that I’d had a cushy time of it. He knew differently about me and even talked to the press about how much like him I was.</p><p name="f63c" id="f63c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He was far more inquisitive about other people than anyone I had ever met. His curiosity about other people enhanced his natural talent and made him a great actor. He was so gifted in so many different areas.</p><p name="0cd7" id="0cd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of Steve’s great gifts was his ability to focus on what was in front of him. When you were in a room together, you felt as if you were in a different universe just with him. He had the ability to focus like a laser beam, and not be distracted by anything else, and I’d never met anyone like that before.</p><p name="09f6" id="09f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You never got the feeling that you were pestering him or that you made him feel rushed, or that he would rather spend that time with someone more important than you.</p><p name="3eb0" id="3eb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You just felt like all of his attention was on you, and therefore, all of your attention was on him. It made for some very deep and meaningful conversations and life lessons. Even today, those lessons reverberate for me.</p><figure name="5c55" id="5c55" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 549px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 122%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GEJhryCDC1Of8o_kzayImQ.jpeg" data-width="450" data-height="549" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*GEJhryCDC1Of8o_kzayImQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Sitting on a comfy sofa at his Solar offices in Studio City, California, a sandal-sporting Steve McQueen poses with actress Lee Purcell during an informal press conference announcing the production of “Adam at 6 A.M.” circa September 19, 1969. <em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">Image Credit: United Press International</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p name="4f71" id="4f71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How exactly did McQueen help you navigate through the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M. </em>publicity firestorm?</strong></p><p name="bf2b" id="bf2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, the big day arrived for his introduction of me to the press. It was a huge press conference held in the beautiful Solar offices, very glamorous, very intimidating.</p><p name="e9f6" id="e9f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a special introduction to the media by Steve McQueen to say, “I have discovered this young lady, and I want you to meet her.” He tried to warn me what I was in for — he chose my outfit, he decided how my hair would be done, and he tried to prepare me for what was in store, but no one really can.</p><p name="0dc6" id="0dc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You just can’t know what it’s going to be like unless you’ve grown up in the spotlight, and I certainly hadn’t. I had never been exposed to that type of scrutiny and frenzy before.</p><p name="6014" id="6014" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the print and television media were there as well as Rona Barrett, who was the gossip maven of that era. If she was where you were, it meant that you were very, very important in “The Industry.” She was very kind to me.</p><p name="96f8" id="96f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Steve’s introduction of me to the press received international coverage. Before we entered the press conference, Steve spoke to me alone in a private room, and said, “The press will be here, and this is what they’re going to ask you, and here’s how you should respond. Keep your cool, and be friendly no matter what they say.”</p><p name="e161" id="e161" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then we walked out arm in arm into a mob of people and blinding lights. Walking into that room was like walking into July 4th fireworks. I was overwhelmed, because I couldn’t see anything for a moment due to the camera flashes and TV lights. But Steve was holding my hand, so I managed to appear calm.</p><p name="7a15" id="7a15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There seemed to be hundreds of people in the room. I don’t know how many people were actually there, but it was certainly more people than I’d ever been questioned by in my life.</p><p name="39c4" id="39c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When he said there’d be a lot of people there, I had no idea of the magnitude. I thought maybe 10 people…who would come out to see me, right? But, they were very curious about me, as Steve had never introduced a young actress to the press before, or after that, as his personal choice for a film of his.</p><p name="08ce" id="08ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Steve introduced me to the media crowd and spoke about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M</em>. and my role in it. He told the media, “My partners and I interviewed close to 500 girls for the lead in this picture. It wasn’t easy. We kept narrowing down the field over a period of a few weeks until it came time to give screen tests to six of them.”</p><p name="9f5a" id="9f5a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“All of them were good, but Lee seemed to jump out of the screen. There’s no way to explain it, but Lee has soul, and it comes through loud and clear. I think this girl and the picture are both going to be hits.” What an introduction! I was stunned.</p><p name="f24b" id="f24b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The press asked many questions about the film, my role, how I got the job, but also some rude questions about my relationship with Steve, which he quickly stepped in and squelched. They only asked me polite questions after that! He was very protective of me.</p><p name="23b7" id="23b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He really knew how to handle the press. He may have not liked them, but he understood they came with the territory of being a movie star, and he had learned exactly how to deal with it.</p><p name="773d" id="773d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We posed for pictures, which are the publicity stills you see today. My favorite picture from that photo session is where we’re standing, laughing, and pointing at each other. To me, that photo personifies our relationship and brings back so many warm memories.</p><figure name="e9c5" id="e9c5" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 379px; max-height: 480px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 126.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*l5-u1R6IHyz-_IM-m31z_A.jpeg" data-width="379" data-height="480" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*l5-u1R6IHyz-_IM-m31z_A.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Lee Purcell, Steve McQueen, and influential Hollywood gossip columnist Rona Barrett are captured in a jovial moment during a press conference at McQueen’s Solar Production offices in Studio City, California, circa September 19, 1969. <em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">Image Credit: United Press International</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p name="e66b" id="e66b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Did you run into McQueen again after the movie wrapped?</strong></p><p name="2701" id="2701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a lot more to the experience than just all that led up to the film and the filming itself.

The lights came up, and somebody came in and whispered something in the director’s ear.</p><p name="382c" id="382c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The director announced to the room that Steve had died, and I just lost it. I absolutely lost it…it was so hard because my whole experience with Steve came rushing back to me at that moment. Only 10 years had passed from the filming of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Adam at 6 A.M</em>. to his death. He had only had 10 more years. That is so tragic. It was such a loss.</p><p name="df42" id="df42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew he was ill, but I didn’t know how serious it was. Steve and I had a mutual friend who had visited Steve at some time during his illness. Shortly after Steve passed away, this friend told me something that really got to me: “You know, when I saw Steve, he asked me where you were and what you were doing. And I told him everything you’re up to.”</p><p name="06d1" id="06d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It just broke my heart. I had so badly wanted to go see him. But, in no way did I think he was going to die. I thought I would get in touch with him after he recovered. Something held me back from seeing him when he was ill.</p><p name="845c" id="845c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In hindsight, I don’t think that he would have wanted me to see him in that condition. And I would never have intruded in his private time with his family during his illness.</p><p name="9f32" id="9f32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of my great regrets is having not seen him before he passed, not thanking him again for what he did for me, and never saying good-bye, but I never thought he was going to die — after all, he was Steve McQueen!</p><p name="7561" id="7561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot believe he’s been gone all these years.
