The detail about her having four children, I mean everyone who breaks the law these days just about has children, and if they are put in jail, whether they are here legally or not legally, they’re going to be separated from their children.”</blockquote><p name="fb51" id="fb51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Well then.

That’s definitely the Christianity espoused by my devout friends of many Christian faiths: you break one law, and chuck you, farley, no quarter given.</p><p name="a5a6" id="a5a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yeah, not so much. Seriously, every day I live here I am shocked and appalled by the things that people say and do while calling themselves Christians.

Who knows? I presume some local Christian is, since it appears that’s all we’ve got in office around here.</p><p name="5f0b" id="5f0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this is just the tip of an iceberg that is barely in view, mere months into Mrs. Keller’s time in office. I live in the next county over, so I didn’t know her in her pre-government role in one of the region’s many “crisis pregnancy centers” like those <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091391" data-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091391" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">known for pushing disinformation</a> on pregnant people in distress and injecting it into the community narrative to compete with actual facts.</p><p name="3f5c" id="3f5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, to be fair to Mrs. Keller, it’s likely that as a long-time resident of Middletown, she has suffered some of the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2013/09/24/75320/why-economic-disadvantage-becomes-educational-disadvantage/" data-href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2013/09/24/75320/why-economic-disadvantage-becomes-educational-disadvantage/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">educational disadvantage</a> rampant in that city’s school district (of which my own husband is a graduate, and which does not compete with Lebanon in football, lest I be accused of simple town-based partisanship).</p><p name="5d0d" id="5d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What are my criteria for saying Middletown is a region experiencing long-term educational disadvantage? Well, for my part, while my academic peers and I were attending Socratic seminars on writing and thinking and spending our summers on museum internships and AP classes at elite private prep schools, my husband’s peer group was in “Marriage and the Family” class getting ready for not one, but two, mock weddings intended to prepare them for the immediate reality of their lives.</p><p name="eb96" id="eb96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My parents’ caste, for lack of a better word, went on sabbaticals from their tenured professor lives, spending a year in Paris or London, or scraping by on grant money while a grad student rents and sublets the house during the doctoral research year in Peru. My in-laws’ caste poured out of Middletown burbclaves in the morning, worked at local industry, and gradually accepted commutes to Cincinnati and Dayton, bemoaning the longer commutes home making them miss their kids’ sporting events at Middletown High School and nearby Bishop Fenwick Catholic high school. Common “getting up to no good” in my high school years involved weed, Robert Fripp, and Kafka; in my husband’s, it involved drunk driving and teen pregnancy and parenthood.</p><p name="8224" id="8224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But don’t take my arguably snobbish word for it. Here’s what Middletown native and Eli (that’s what people from my parents’ caste often call folks who went to Yale, put it in your mental crossword-puzzle-words file) has to say on it:</p><blockquote name="12ab" id="12ab" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And yet there was no sense that failing to achieve higher education would bring shame or any other consequences. The message wasn’t explicit; teachers didn’t tell us that we were too stupid or too poor to make it. Nevertheless, it was all around us, like the air we breathed: No one in our families had gone to college; older friends and siblings were perfectly content to stay in Middletown, regardless of their career prospects; we knew no one at a prestigious out-of-state school; and everyone knew at least one young adult who was underemployed or didn’t have a job at all. In Middletown, 20 percent of the public high school’s entering freshmen won’t make it to graduations. Most won’t graduate from college. Virtually no one will go to college out of state.”</blockquote><p name="d99c" id="d99c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">— VANCE, J. D. (2016). <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Hillbilly elegy: a memoir of a family and culture in crisis</em>.</p><p name="1f80" id="1f80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, anyway, yeah, there’s no reason to conclude that Mrs. Keller is even necessarily aware of the potential educational disadvantage in which her entire life could have been spent. Like many of Vance’s peers, or my husband’s, perhaps she simply doesn’t know what she doesn’t know — like the folks who, when asking where my husband and I worked in California, stared blankly when we said “Stanford.” I realize it’s a highbrow academic’s conceit to imagine everyone’s heard of the big names in the university game, but in defense of my erstwhile self, until I lived here, it was typically the case — yes, even in the remote Andes where my parents did their fieldwork (speaking of lives alien to those who, in their mid-forties, are grandparents several times over and have never been to an airport, let alone ridden a plane).</p><p name="0310" id="0310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But why does this digression matter? Simply put, because it’s clear that Mrs. Keller has a somewhat sketchy relationship with facts. There’s no fundamental reason why someone from a community facing economic and educational disadvantage shouldn’t be capable of acquiring an education (indeed, see J.D. Vance and countless other Middletown natives who have left, most never to return) that prioritizes facts and thinking. But for myriad reasons, Middletown seems to fail on this front, and if you live in this general vicinity, as I have with my family for the past eleven years, you’ve heard lots of talk about Middletown schools. Lots of it, and I’d challenge you to find one piece of it that made you feel warm and fuzzy, no matter who you are or what your political bent.</p><p name="180f" id="180f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What shows me Mrs. Keller struggles to form a fact-based narrative to support? Simply put, it’s her own statements about the platform she does support. For example, she’s still putting forth the proven-false narrative of women’s health clinics selling baby parts, and she has plainly dismissed credible scientific studies indicating that the most effective path to preventing abortions is to provide everyone in a community with fact-based sex education and access to contraception.</p><p name="2db4" id="2db4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, like I say, I can understand how that happens to someone from Middletown. It’s a tough community for someone to live in if they’re not on the megachurch prosperity gospel keep-women-in-their-place train that is, realistically, probably the last remaining path to hope for some of Middletown’s most tragically disenfranchised and disaffected. I’m not without sympathy, compassion, and empathy for people in that position. Including Mrs. Keller, who I’m sure holds her positions in the most heartfelt and sincere way possible.</p><p name="53f7" id="53f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This whole story runs much deeper than just Mrs. Keller, though. Indeed, I might argue that Mrs. Keller is to be credited for her decision to run for office and put her principles into political action, even though it’s clear that she and I would likely be hard-pressed to find any political common ground at all.</p><p name="8644" id="8644" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s what gets me. Take a look at this excerpt from the Cincinnati Enquirer’s voter guide for the 2016 general election, comparing the question and answers given by Mrs. Keller and her opponent, Democrat Suzi Rubin:</p><figure name="b0dd" id="b0dd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 499px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 71.39999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*g3dVuZ0qrsZ1EAch2imguQ.jpeg" data-width="925" data-height="660" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*g3dVuZ0qrsZ1EAch2imguQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g3dVuZ0qrsZ1EAch2imguQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/enquirer16/race-detail.do?id=14544132" data-href="http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/enquirer16/race-detail.do?id=14544132" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/enquirer16/race-detail.do?id=14544132</a></figcaption></figure><p name="04e0" id="04e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Rubin, at right, responds to the question by stating what experience she brings to the table, in which arenas, how she acquired it and when, as well as how her work in those roles affected her sphere of influence, under what circumstances.</p><p name="6613" id="6613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By contrast, Mrs. Keller says:</p><blockquote name="5f7c" id="5f7c" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I am the only candidate in this race with a proven conservative track record. This district does not want an establishment go-along-to-get-along Representative. I will not be backed by people who are part of the problem. My opponent is backed by people who are part of the problem.”</blockquote><p name="e90c" id="e90c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">So, let’s say I’m a conservative. No, seriously, there are plenty of times when I’ve been called conservative — like for my support of the Constitution and its applicability to unpopular people, for criticizing Obama on a variety of things ranging from economic policy to torture, for my support of the individual right to keep and bear arms, and for the many times I’ve waded into the fray with my academic elite peers lambasting their failure to understand people from dramatically different backgrounds.</p><p name="87f1" id="87f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, let’s say I’m a conservative. What does Mrs. Keller provide to me in her answer other than assertion that she has a proven track record as one? What does conservatism mean to her? I mean, what did Middletown schools tell her the word meant? And then again, even if they had told her it means “favoring the system and the status quo as they presently exist, expecting any change to the system to follow the system’s rules for changing the status quo” — how much of the world has defined it for some time — Mrs. Keller has spent her entire life existing in a culture which has told her that “conservatism” means Jesus, guns, and preventing fetal tissue from being legally extracted from the bodies of people who have concluded they cannot keep it there longer.</p><p name="ff9e" id="ff9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I only know that, though, from following politics closely enough to have seen Mrs. Keller’s name in the news and, following several occurrences of her name in the news clearly and provably attached to statements that made me gasp in shock, researched her published position statements, social media, and history as a candidate and officeholder.</p><p name="5f1f" id="5f1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I should, at this point, mention that I have been told on no few occasions that people here think I spend a lot of time and energy on following news and current events and politics — like, to the point where it looks like a hobby for me. I don’t consider myself remarkably engaged in these pursuits; in a typical day throughout my life, I’ve spent one to two hours per day consuming news and current events media and thinking about the topics, and I view that as a general baseline among many people of my acquaintance around the world and throughout my 45 years. I never cast a vote without having researched the candidate by at least reading the basic information published by a local newspaper, a local TV or radio station, and the League of Women Voters; I never fail to review my sample ballot prior to showing up to vote. And again, these are things I was taught to do — in public school in New England, by my parents, and by the communities in which I lived. I mean, they didn’t teach me how to plan a wedding, but they did teach me how to be a cog in the wheels of participatory democracy.</p><p name="1b1d" id="1b1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But to someone who didn’t grow up with that? To someone who thinks an hour or two a day is too long to spend, because nobody around them spends it, choosing instead to track a favorite pitcher’s ERA or do their March Madness brackets, or to watch and read live tweets about Dancing With The Stars? To someone who knows “conservative” as a name for what they are, and assumes anyone else using it means the same thing, perhaps it’s enough to hear someone say they identify the same way.</p><p name="fb5c" id="fb5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the Tea Party gamble, writ large in the opening sentence of Mrs. Keller’s answer to the question of what makes her the best candidate to represent her district in the statehouse: “because I am what you call yourself.”</p><p name="b767" id="b767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s no content in her claim to conservatism. There’s only a statement of identity.</p><p name="2e8b" id="2e8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it doesn’t stop there. She continues,</p><blockquote name="bb47" id="bb47" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This district does not want an establishment go-along-to-get-along Representative.”</blockquote><p name="dfc8" id="dfc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">As a general thing, that’s… probably true, or at least resonant. It’s also cleverly crafted to resonate, by setting up as a given that we’re talking about “this district” as a whole, and stating what that whole doesn’t want, and then that there’s an establishment, which plays go-along-to-get-along. So if we’re going to fit in with this district (which isn’t going along to get along in this case, I guess) we’ll get in line against the establishment (I always think it’s interesting when there’s an authoritarian tone to an anti-establishment statement, but that’s a whole ‘nother kettle of fish).</p><p name="d4b2" id="d4b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, that translates to: “I will get up in your face with people who I deem establishment, or who I think are seeking compromise.” So, if I have reason to believe Mrs. Keller means the same thing by “conservative” that I do, then I probably feel like this is a strong statement and means something. And if I don’t really pay a lot of attention to news and politics and all that stuff, and this is all I see (in the local paper), I might relate to it.</p><blockquote name="f2c2" id="f2c2" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I will not be backed by people who are part of the problem.”</blockquote><p name="0bb5" id="0bb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">See, this is also clever. I mean, me with my fancy academic upbringing and all, I read this and the first thing I think is “Okay, cool, so who are those people?” and that’s why I go looking, when I’m reading my sample ballot and the thing in the paper, and all, before the election. But if I didn’t do that homework? If instead, I just took it at face value and transferred it onto my own pre-existing perception of “people who are part of the problem?” Fuck yeah! They’re not backing Mrs. Keller! I mean, whoever they are!</p><p name="9f33" id="9f33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That doesn’t wash in an overeducated liberal elite household, believe me. BELIEVE ME. See, I’m trying that style on for a second. Ahem. Seriously though, it won’t play. All those snotty little smart kids destined for liberal arts colleges are getting up in their parents’ faces about whether or not “smart kids eat their vegetables” is an <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/a%20priori" data-href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/a%20priori" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a priori</a> statement, and the parents are debating back while serving more organic sprout slaw and patting themselves (I’d say ourselves, but I’m pretty much the only sprout-slaw eater in my household) on the back for raising kids with a grasp of rhetoric. I’ve no way of knowing what’s going on in households like Mrs. Keller’s, but based on meals I’ve shared since moving here, saying “something like that discussion of rhetoric never seems to happen over ham salad and walking tacos” is as a posteriori as noticing it’s churchy as hell in Middletown. And Butler County at large.</p><figure name="68fa" id="68fa" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="/media/7d4b2fab46af8086ac7246ba0fb17987?postId=b47ac26d4f95" data-media-id="7d4b2fab46af8086ac7246ba0fb17987" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fzsb2pMzwmdI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Just Middletown things</figcaption></figure><p name="71b4" id="71b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">But back to Mrs. Keller’s cleverly crafted statement.</p><blockquote name="7d1d" id="7d1d" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">My opponent is backed by people who are part of the problem.</blockquote><p name="5254" id="5254" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">I guess there’s no nice way to say this. I can’t entirely step away from the fact that I grew up around so many Christians, that I myself am the granddaughter of missionaries. But I would say to Mrs. Keller: I’ve found a lot of things to think about in repeated readings of Matthew’s take of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. It starts in chapter 5 and runs through chapter 7, and this is stuff many of my Christian friends and I have found ourselves talking about lots over the years. I wouldn’t presume to define how you relate to Jesus, but maybe this is a topic you could ask your pastor about.</p></div></div></section><section name="5dae" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0384" id="0384" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">It’s challenging, on so many levels, to contain the emotions raised by the kinds of statements Mrs. Keller seems to make routinely — by her apparent lack of compassion for families and communities torn apart in her very district, by policies she supports and endorses. This is by no means typical of Butler County’s Christian population, by the way — diverse faith-based coalitions stand in direct opposition to Mrs. Keller’s views, and are themselves bound to be her targets right along with the politicians who support efforts to aid refugees, undocumented residents or the region and their citizen families, and the area’s most desperate poor in their quests to simply survive.</p><p name="5813" id="5813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, as so many are eager to remind us all, we should remember all the people who don’t have the educational privilege to know how to read a ballot, research a candidate, and determine what it is that candidate actually stands for. If, that is, they stand for anything at all. We should, some say, find empathy and compassion for people like the constituents who brought Mrs. Keller to her present role in Butler County — where she is one more elected official who clearly believes her role in government is not to represent the totality of her district, but rather, to represent the subset whose “vote now” buttons were pushed by the mere notion that she can claim a Christian conservative identity. Everyone else? You lost, get over it. You have no representation.</p><p name="1d4b" id="1d4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">That’s the trend to which I wish to call attention: the “You lost, get over it” trend, which may be the most succinct way to summarize the trending belief that a Representative’s job is to serve the partisan interests of whatever radicalized fringe agenda is most shocking and immoderate among their voter base.</strong></p><p name="baf4" id="baf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mrs. Keller, like many of her Tea Party compatriots seizing control of the Grand Old Party, crafted her statement with the backers she mentions — to expect that old-school conservatives who read that, first and foremost, she’s the conservative with a proven track record would vote for her on that basis despite her more extremist platform. But she and her backers also knew they could count on lots of other people who would read whatever they wanted to into “conservative.”</p><p name="b388" id="b388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s what Mrs. Keller understands: there are plenty of people for whom “conservative” is an identity, even though they don’t have a clear sense of what it has historically meant from a policy perspective, or the background and education to understand it now, based on brief explanations. And lots and lots of them pay no attention to politics to speak of. That’s a big chunk of her voter base. But the vocal ones? The people who’ve literally been there for her all through her newly-launched career in politics? They’re part of a culture we’re spending a lot of time trying to either understand or manipulate (and that’s a topic for another entire piece).</p><p name="8472" id="8472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re talking about people who feel empowered and uplifted by words like her final statement on her comparison of Planned Parenthood to Nazis.

That’s her whole statement. She said that, and deleted her Facebook, in a classic rookie move that shows she doesn’t think her positions stand up to scrutiny or challenge. Seriously, it’s a rookie move so classic it’s called the flounce, and it’s been considered part of the basic “thin-skinned Internet novice” package for decades now. I think you can get bonus points for doing it as an elected official, with your flounce statement given to a local TV station, though. We’d probably have to ask judges for a ruling.</p><p name="cbe5" id="cbe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, she’ll be back, and she’ll likely cite “having been forced to delete her Facebook page” and allege that people who left her comments like “Did you seriously share that?

Someone’s gonna see her claim, believe it wholesale, and start spreading the narrative that “liberals forced her” to delete her page and make the absurd statement she did. And that’ll feed right into the formulaic Tea Party power-aggregation methodology that’s easy to spot for anybody who does pay attention to news and politics and all that boring stuff, and apparently invisible to so many “identity conservatives,” as I’ve taken to calling them — conservatives for whom being a conservative is more important than clearly articulating what that means.</p><p name="f01c" id="f01c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A side note: there are certainly “identity liberals” as well, but that’s not who represents Ohio’s 53rd state congressional district, nor are they thick on the ground in southwestern Ohio.</p><p name="3862" id="3862" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I already bought “she’ll be back, and playing the victim” in the office pool on this, by the way.

That doesn’t mean I agree with her, support any of the same positions, think she’s good at her job, or think she deserves her job. But that’s moot; she’s not my representative (mine’s the somewhat more sedate Paul Zeltwanger, who <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Paul_Zeltwanger" data-href="https://ballotpedia.org/Paul_Zeltwanger" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">seems to have spent most of his time in office so far sponsoring legislation to honor fellow legislators in Columbus</a>).</p><p name="4ded" id="4ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But before considering running for office, before signing up to go to protests, before anything else, I would urge every single person who thinks they may ever be eligible to vote in the USA to institute the simple practices I use before voting:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="d880" id="d880" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Visit your county/local/state board of elections web site to find out what elections are coming up in which you can vote.</li><li name="acf2" id="acf2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Download a sample ballot for that election, from the aforementioned board of elections web site</li><li name="3784" id="3784" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Read the local news media’s report along the lines of “the candidates and the issues.” I promise you there is one.</li><li name="c072" id="c072" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Google the candidates and the issues.</li><li name="f7fb" id="f7fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Look for their endorsements.

I can’t help but wonder if it will be like the low-level Nazi officials who believed abortion should not be legal, or more like those who believed in rounding up parents and children and making them disappear. Which is to say, it remembers them so little that it would, indeed, be a hobby to research them sufficiently to find the name of one just like you.</p></div></div></section><section name="7c07" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="89da" id="89da" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Thanks for reading!

Like many of Vance’s peers, or my husband’s, perhaps she simply doesn’t know what she doesn’t know — like the folks who, when asking where my husband and I worked in California, stared blankly when we said “Stanford.” I realize it’s a highbrow academic’s conceit to imagine everyone’s heard of the big names in the university game, but in defense of my erstwhile self, until I lived here, it was typically the case — yes, even in the remote Andes where my parents did their fieldwork (speaking of lives alien to those who, in their mid-forties, are grandparents several times over and have never been to an airport, let alone ridden a plane).","markups":[]},{"name":"0310","type":1,"text":"But why does this digression matter? Simply put, because it’s clear that Mrs. Keller has a somewhat sketchy relationship with facts. There’s no fundamental reason why someone from a community facing economic and educational disadvantage shouldn’t be capable of acquiring an education (indeed, see J.D. Vance and countless other Middletown natives who have left, most never to return) that prioritizes facts and thinking. But for myriad reasons, Middletown seems to fail on this front, and if you live in this general vicinity, as I have with my family for the past eleven years, you’ve heard lots of talk about Middletown schools. Lots of it, and I’d challenge you to find one piece of it that made you feel warm and fuzzy, no matter who you are or what your political bent.","markups":[]},{"name":"180f","type":1,"text":"What shows me Mrs. Keller struggles to form a fact-based narrative to support? Simply put, it’s her own statements about the platform she does support.

I never cast a vote without having researched the candidate by at least reading the basic information published by a local newspaper, a local TV or radio station, and the League of Women Voters; I never fail to review my sample ballot prior to showing up to vote. And again, these are things I was taught to do — in public school in New England, by my parents, and by the communities in which I lived.

This is by no means typical of Butler County’s Christian population, by the way — diverse faith-based coalitions stand in direct opposition to Mrs. Keller’s views, and are themselves bound to be her targets right along with the politicians who support efforts to aid refugees, undocumented residents or the region and their citizen families, and the area’s most desperate poor in their quests to simply survive.","markups":[]},{"name":"5813","type":1,"text":"And yet, as so many are eager to remind us all, we should remember all the people who don’t have the educational privilege to know how to read a ballot, research a candidate, and determine what it is that candidate actually stands for. If, that is, they stand for anything at all. We should, some say, find empathy and compassion for people like the constituents who brought Mrs. Keller to her present role in Butler County — where she is one more elected official who clearly believes her role in government is not to represent the totality of her district, but rather, to represent the subset whose “vote now” buttons were pushed by the mere notion that she can claim a Christian conservative identity. Everyone else? You lost, get over it. You have no representation.","markups":[]},{"name":"1d4b","type":1,"text":"That’s the trend to which I wish to call attention: the “You lost, get over it” trend, which may be the most succinct way to summarize the trending belief that a Representative’s job is to serve the partisan interests of whatever radicalized fringe agenda is most shocking and immoderate among their voter base.","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":311}]},{"name":"baf4","type":1,"text":"Mrs. Keller, like many of her Tea Party compatriots seizing control of the Grand Old Party, crafted her statement with the backers she mentions — to expect that old-school conservatives who read that, first and foremost, she’s the conservative with a proven track record would vote for her on that basis despite her more extremist platform. But she and her backers also knew they could count on lots of other people who would read whatever they wanted to into “conservative.”","markups":[]},{"name":"b388","type":1,"text":"Here’s what Mrs. Keller understands: there are plenty of people for whom “conservative” is an identity, even though they don’t have a clear sense of what it has historically meant from a policy perspective, or the background and education to understand it now, based on brief explanations. And lots and lots of them pay no attention to politics to speak of. That’s a big chunk of her voter base. But the vocal ones? The people who’ve literally been there for her all through her newly-launched career in politics?
