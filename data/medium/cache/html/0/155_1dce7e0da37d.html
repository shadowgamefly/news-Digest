id="5c23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Welcome, this is my first preview of a UFC card. After a terrible UFC 208 this card has some exciting matchups. <br>The goal of this is to give a somewhat detailed preview for couple of the fights and give a quick look at the rest of the fights. <br>I’ll also include a bet of the week – starting with €100 – Let’s see will I make a profit!</p><p name="f446" id="f446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lightweight Alessandro Ricci vs. Paul Felder</p><p name="7ee5" id="7ee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first fight I’m going to look into is the fan favourite Paul Felder takes on Alessandro Ricci. Alvaro Herrera was expected to face Alessandro Ricci at the event, however, Herrera pulled out of the fight in mid-January citing injury and was replaced by Paul Felder.</p><p name="8640" id="8640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Irish dragon Felder is a super exciting fighter that is coming off a bad loss to Francisco Trainaldo. He found it difficult to deal with the pressure from the Brazilian. Felder is a fan favourite for his exciting style but has picked up a lot of losses because of this style. His strange offense leaves him open to counters and overall his defence is poor. Felder’s style allows a tough pressure fighter to out work him. To do this however you have to be elite. Felder’s top ground game is good but he will never look to get the fight to the ground he wants to stand and throw spinning backfists! (One thing to note, Felder has decided to move to Duke Ruesport (Pettis’ camp) for this fight and it will be interesting to see the changes he employs)</p><p name="afb5" id="afb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alessandro Ricci is a Canadian fighter coming off a loss to fellow Canadian and big prospect Jeremy Kennedy. Funny enough he gets quite a big step up from his last fight and a huge step up from his original opponent. The Canadian had talked about retirement before he filled in on short notice for his UFC debut. He has very good knees and attacks the body well. He struggled against a pressure game in his last fight and from anything else I can find on him he seems contempt with allowing his opponents to dictate the pace.</p><p name="39a0" id="39a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This fight is going to be sweet. It should be a tough stand-up brawl. I think Felder is going to see some scary moments but he will eventually land and land big. I do think there is a chance this change in camp could create a cautious version of the Irish Dragon but overall I think he pushes forward and lands big on the Canadian. <br>Pick <br>Felder (Spinning KO) KO round 3</p><p name="bf71" id="bf71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Women’s Strawweight Carla Esparza vs. Randa Markos <br>Number 4 takes on Randa Markos in a very important 115lb fight (How is this not on the main card?). These two hated each other in the ultimate fighter and it will be interesting to see them interacting before the fight.</p><p name="76bd" id="76bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Carla Esparza has supposedly found it very tough to find a fight, she had to sell the Harley Davidson she won on TUF to survive. I alike Claudia Gaulda don’t believe this story but that’s another story for another day. She had in my books the worst title defence in UFC history and took a lot of time off before returning to beat Juliana Lema. Her striking is very poor however she has the best wrestler in the division and her relentless pace will be a challenge for any opponent. If you can stop the takedown you will beat her.</p><p name="5663" id="5663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Randa Markos looked superb in the TUF house but has not set the world on fire since. She isn’t the most physically gifted athlete and this often causes her trouble. The issue for me with her in this fight is I think she will be willing to go to the ground with Carla. She is a very crafty on the ground but she won’t be able to control the best wrestler in the division there.</p><p name="a236" id="a236" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love the Women’s strawweight division because it is like looking back in time. Carla represents a period where a wrestler could take their opponent down and break them. She was clearly found out by Johanna but still most of the women in this division will not be able to stop the take down. <br>Carla the Cookie Monster by Decision <br>(Get her to fight Claudia Gadelha next)</p><p name="f670" id="f670" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Middleweight Johny Hendricks vs. Hector Lombard<br>Up next is 2 guys that are in a bad need of a win. They are former Welterweights that have moved to middleweight for greener pastors. It will be interesting to see what these guys have left.</p><p name="6396" id="6396" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Johny Hendrick’s fall from grace has been well publicized, since becoming champ he has lost 3 times and has said he will retire if this fight doesn’t go his way. Hendricks used to be a quality wrestler with a big KO threat. His striking used to be fairly similar to the current champ Woodley. He had the ability to cover a crazy amount of distance very quickly and land big. His top control has always been quality - see Carlos Condit fight. He also showed this in his last fight but didn’t has the gas to execute the game plan. There is a quality fighter in Hendrick but his crazy weight cutting has had terrible effects on his career.</p><p name="97d8" id="97d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hector Lombard took ages to come to the UFC he was 31-2-1 when he eventually arrived. His UFC career has been mixed at best. He has crazy KO power and with his physic he is tough to take down. Most thought putting him against Dan Henderson was a true tune up fight for Lombard until he got KO’ed. Lombard was caught for steroids in 2015 and since he has looked the same. He definitely doesn’t have the chin he used to have either. Another negative aspect of Lombard’s game is his stamina, it was never great due to his style. If you survive his onslaught he will fade and become easy to finish.</p><p name="e19d" id="e19d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think this is the new era of Johny Hendricks. He will roll back the years to his regular self because he won’t have to worry about his weight cut. Lombard is finished he might give Hendricks a scare but a healthy Hendricks wins this.<br>Hendricks by tko round 3 <br>(NOTE: If Hendricks pulls a lineker and misses or noticeably struggles to make weight after moving up weight all bets are off!)</p><p name="32f5" id="32f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Heavyweight Derrick Lewis vs. Travis Browne<br>The main event is an interesting fight that will answer 2 questions. A) Is Lewis actually good? B) Is Brown actually good?</p><p name="6f5c" id="6f5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lewis has built a name from himself through his social media and very good interviews, his fighting not so much. He is coming off 5 wins but each of the wins were against relatively poor opponents or shot fighter (Shamil Abdurakhimov, Roy Nelson, Gabriel Gonzaga, Damian Grabowski, Viktor Pešta this time next year I would say none will be in the UFC) Lewis is a powerhouse when he lands just due to his size and strength he will cause trouble. His technique isn’t great but at heavyweight, power and chin will bring you a long way. Lewis’ style is pressure he is constantly slowing prodding forward looking to land.</p><p name="ac48" id="ac48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hapa Brown was the future of the heavyweight division until he started getting top 5 opponents. His style is exciting to watch. His last fight against Werdem was a bizarre affair with Browne hurting his finger and coach Edmond Tarverdyan fighting Werdum after the fight. Browne has an interesting style with an extremely wide stance,this allows him to keep his opponent miles away from him. The top fighters like Cain will rush him and historically he can’t deal with it. His best every performance was his KO over Overeem and this was because Overeem’s game is to stay away and counter. Give Brown room and he will pick you apart with his kickboxing. If you can rush him though he is very hittable and once he gets hit he legs go to jelly leaving his only defence being to throw wild shots.</p><p name="a0af" id="a0af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Browne is a better MMA fighter than Lewis. I think he’ll KO Lewis early will a flashy kick.<br>Browne KO round 1</p><p name="075c" id="075c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Heavyweight Derrick Lewis vs. Travis Browne – <br>Browne 1st KO</p><p name="5f19" id="5f19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Middleweight Johny Hendricks vs. Hector Lombard – <br>Hendricks 3rd TKO</p><p name="6755" id="6755" class="graf graf--p

Alvaro Herrera was expected to face Alessandro Ricci at the event, however, Herrera pulled out of the fight in mid-January citing injury and was replaced by Paul Felder.","markups":[]},{"name":"8640","type":1,"text":"The Irish dragon Felder is a super exciting fighter that is coming off a bad loss to Francisco Trainaldo. He found it difficult to deal with the pressure from the Brazilian. Felder is a fan favourite for his exciting style but has picked up a lot of losses because of this style. His strange offense leaves him open to counters and overall his defence is poor. Felder’s style allows a tough pressure fighter to out work him. To do this however you have to be elite. Felder’s top ground game is good but he will never look to get the fight to the ground he wants to stand and throw spinning backfists! (One thing to note, Felder has decided to move to Duke Ruesport (Pettis’ camp) for this fight and it will be interesting to see the changes he employs)","markups":[]},{"name":"afb5","type":1,"text":"Alessandro Ricci is a Canadian fighter coming off a loss to fellow Canadian and big prospect Jeremy Kennedy. Funny enough he gets quite a big step up from his last fight and a huge step up from his original opponent. The Canadian had talked about retirement before he filled in on short notice for his UFC debut. He has very good knees and attacks the body well. He struggled against a pressure game in his last fight and from anything else I can find on him he seems contempt with allowing his opponents to dictate the pace.","markups":[]},{"name":"39a0","type":1,"text":"This fight is going to be sweet. It should be a tough stand-up brawl. I think Felder is going to see some scary moments but he will eventually land and land big. I do think there is a chance this change in camp could create a cautious version of the Irish Dragon but overall I think he pushes forward and lands big on the Canadian. \nPick \nFelder (Spinning KO) KO round 3","markups":[]},{"name":"bf71","type":1,"text":"Women’s Strawweight Carla Esparza vs. Randa Markos \nNumber 4 takes on Randa Markos in a very important 115lb fight (How is this not on the main card?). These two hated each other in the ultimate fighter and it will be interesting to see them interacting before the fight.","markups":[]},{"name":"76bd","type":1,"text":"Carla Esparza has supposedly found it very tough to find a fight, she had to sell the Harley Davidson she won on TUF to survive. I alike Claudia Gaulda don’t believe this story but that’s another story for another day. She had in my books the worst title defence in UFC history and took a lot of time off before returning to beat Juliana Lema. Her striking is very poor however she has the best wrestler in the division and her relentless pace will be a challenge for any opponent. If you can stop the takedown you will beat her.","markups":[]},{"name":"5663","type":1,"text":"Randa Markos looked superb in the TUF house but has not set the world on fire since. She isn’t the most physically gifted athlete and this often causes her trouble. The issue for me with her in this fight is I think she will be willing to go to the ground with Carla. She is a very crafty on the ground but she won’t be able to control the best wrestler in the division there.","markups":[]},{"name":"a236","type":1,"text":"I love the Women’s strawweight division because it is like looking back in time. Carla represents a period where a wrestler could take their opponent down and break them. She was clearly found out by Johanna but still most of the women in this division will not be able to stop the take down. \nCarla the Cookie Monster by Decision \n(Get her to fight Claudia Gadelha next)","markups":[]},{"name":"f670","type":1,"text":"Middleweight Johny Hendricks vs. Hector Lombard\nUp next is 2 guys that are in a bad need of a win. They are former Welterweights that have moved to middleweight for greener pastors. It will be interesting to see what these guys have left.","markups":[]},{"name":"6396","type":1,"text":"Johny Hendrick’s fall from grace has been well publicized, since becoming champ he has lost 3 times and has said he will retire if this fight doesn’t go his way. Hendricks used to be a quality wrestler with a big KO threat. His striking used to be fairly similar to the current champ Woodley. He had the ability to cover a crazy amount of distance very quickly and land big. His top control has always been quality - see Carlos Condit fight. He also showed this in his last fight but didn’t has the gas to execute the game plan. There is a quality fighter in Hendrick but his crazy weight cutting has had terrible effects on his career.","markups":[]},{"name":"97d8","type":1,"text":"Hector Lombard took ages to come to the UFC he was 31-2-1 when he eventually arrived. His UFC career has been mixed at best. He has crazy KO power and with his physic he is tough to take down. Most thought putting him against Dan Henderson was a true tune up fight for Lombard until he got KO’ed. Lombard was caught for steroids in 2015 and since he has looked the same. He definitely doesn’t have the chin he used to have either. Another negative aspect of Lombard’s game is his stamina, it was never great due to his style. If you survive his onslaught he will fade and become easy to finish.","markups":[]},{"name":"e19d","type":1,"text":"I think this is the new era of Johny Hendricks. He will roll back the years to his regular self because he won’t have to worry about his weight cut. Lombard is finished he might give Hendricks a scare but a healthy Hendricks wins this.\nHendricks by tko round 3 \n(NOTE: If Hendricks pulls a lineker and misses or noticeably struggles to make weight after moving up weight all bets are off!)","markups":[]},{"name":"32f5","type":1,"text":"Heavyweight Derrick Lewis vs. Travis Browne\nThe main event is an interesting fight that will answer 2 questions. A) Is Lewis actually good? B) Is Brown actually good?","markups":[]},{"name":"6f5c","type":1,"text":"Lewis has built a name from himself through his social media and very good interviews, his fighting not so much. He is coming off 5 wins but each of the wins were against relatively poor opponents or shot fighter (Shamil Abdurakhimov, Roy Nelson, Gabriel Gonzaga, Damian Grabowski, Viktor Pešta this time next year I would say none will be in the UFC) Lewis is a powerhouse when he lands just due to his size and strength he will cause trouble. His technique isn’t great but at heavyweight, power and chin will bring you a long way. Lewis’ style is pressure he is constantly slowing prodding forward looking to land.","markups":[]},{"name":"ac48","type":1,"text":"Hapa Brown was the future of the heavyweight division until he started getting top 5 opponents. His style is exciting to watch. His last fight against Werdem was a bizarre affair with Browne hurting his finger and coach Edmond Tarverdyan fighting Werdum after the fight. Browne has an interesting style with an extremely wide stance,this allows him to keep his opponent miles away from him. The top fighters like Cain will rush him and historically he can’t deal with it. His best every performance was his KO over Overeem and this was because Overeem’s game is to stay away and counter. Give Brown room and he will pick you apart with his kickboxing. If you can rush him though he is very hittable and once he gets hit he legs go to jelly leaving his only defence being to throw wild shots.","markups":[]},{"name":"a0af","type":1,"text":"Browne is a better MMA fighter than Lewis.
