We have not scratched the surface at all of what is coming.</p><p name="38d7" id="38d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s usefulness is particularly apparent in its ability to coordinate amorphous groups: actors/agents who might not necessarily be aligned otherwise. It truly feels to me like some cocktail of design elements here will lead to the proliferation of the unfathomable: both in terms of wealth creation &amp; the achievement of shared goals we haven’t seen before.</p><p name="8c5a" id="8c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you look at public blockchains such as Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum, the designs has already managed the ability for amorphous actors to coordinate around some shared truth *without* a specific actor being responsible for it.</p><blockquote name="f9c4" id="f9c4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Tokens not only make people burn electricity, but they also make people say things online.” — Maciej Olpinski</blockquote><p name="4f96" id="4f96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To paint more of the picture, I want to take a step back and explain how we got this current point. There’s interesting events from history that I feel forms part of a larger trend on where we could be heading. As they say: the past doesn’t necessarily repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme.</p><p name="d530" id="d530" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Building larger systems of coordination is not as straightforward as just throwing more resources at it. After a certain threshold, our prefrontal cortex needs to be consistently “hacked” to allow for larger systems of coordination. If we are to believe Dunbar’s Number, we are pretty much stuck at being able to maintain 150 strong social relationships. But why do we have companies larger than that? Nation states larger than that? We *do* organise in groups larger than 150, but what makes it possible? There are various things that occurred in history that made it easier for us to remain meaningfully aligned on shared goals. It also made it possible to remain aligned at scales that weren’t possible before. These give us clues on where we might be heading and what systems of organisation might succeed over others into the future.</p><p name="d200" id="d200" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key feature that changed organisations over the years has been: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">reducing transaction costs to coordinate</strong>.</p><p name="2b23" id="2b23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is reflected in Coase’s Theory of the Firm. You can do marginal improvements, like applying decision support systems within in an organisation, but every once in a while, a large systemic change occurs that at first looks like a marginal benefit, but in essence enables wholly new type of organisations to exist. For example, allowing anyone to create a joint-stock corporation was originally implemented to reduce the legal burden of larger and larger general partnerships that were forming (eg it’s less admin to sue one entity than 100 people).</p><p name="35bc" id="35bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certain systems work fine for certain shared goals. A general partnership for example can be fine for a 3 person auto-repair shop, but impossible for an organisation at the scale of Apple. In other words: A limited liability joint-stock corporation doesn’t necessarily reduce transaction costs substantially more so than a general partnership for this 3 person auto-repair shop, but it does enable a corporation like Apple to exist.</p><p name="712c" id="712c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reducing transaction costs enable organisations to function at larger scales. You introduce the ability for this system to have a stronger gravitational pull at its center, which allows more weak ties to coalesce at the edges. The story of larger and larger organisations is what they look like when they lower the barrier to entry for more weaker tie coordination at its edges. Reducing the barriers to entry for small, incentivized contributions from the weak tie edges end up producing, grand, stigmergic emergence. We saw this with the change from mass general partnerships in the early industrial revolution to the explosion of the joint-stock corporation thereafter.</p><p name="bbc4" id="bbc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But now we can create Dogecoin, which in any circumstances pre-Bitcoin would not have existed. Creating a company to only create a memetic currency would just not have worked. There is a new “dark matter” rising that manages to coordinate a galaxy of people, and it is the ability to create new schelling points of coordination anchored into a shared, decentralized truth using blockchained tokens.</p><p name="7dac" id="7dac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before I give some more concrete examples, I first want to share some of the interesting reasons why new forms of organisation came about.</p><p name="bf2b" id="bf2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Interesting History</strong></p><p name="a519" id="a519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s (loosely) estimated that about <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-companies-exist-in-the-world" data-href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-companies-exist-in-the-world" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">~120–200m formally registered</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-small-businesses-are-there-in-the-world" data-href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-small-businesses-are-there-in-the-world" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">incorporated SMEs exist in the world</a>. How did we get here, and why is the “corporation” so prolific? It has created untold wealth, and irrevocably led humanity down a winding rabbit hole. It’s a fascinating history.</p><p name="99a9" id="99a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For much of humanity’s history, the modern corporation (as we know it) did not exist. It was only really at the tail-end of the industrial revolution that the modern corporation began.</p><p name="02bb" id="02bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before that things were quite interesting. Sharing the risk of a venture usually took on the form of something that looks like a partnership. The joint-stock corporation with its limited liability were the domain of only a few. In order to be incorporated, one had to get a royal charter.</p><p name="e898" id="e898" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before we named corporations after domain name extensions, companies had grand names such as: “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Merchant_Adventurers_to_New_Lands" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Merchant_Adventurers_to_New_Lands" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Mystery, Company, and Fellowship of Merchant Adventurers for the Discovery of Regions, Dominions, Islands, and Places Unknown</a>”.</p><p name="9fd6" id="9fd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A royal charter usually meant that a specific corporation had monopoly rights (like access to trade routes or colonies). However, the ability of being able to transfer shares &amp; have limited liability eventually became more important (vs the monopoly rights), especially during the industrial revolution when more charters were given for ventures not related to mercantilism (like building roads).</p><p name="5b03" id="5b03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The industrial revolution created economies of scale that led to a rise in wealth and population, which meant that more organisations were being created. Many of these companies however didn’t have the privilege of a separate legal personality &amp; limited liability. This was still the domain of a few. This started to cause regulatory burden due to the large amount of unincorporated associations and general partnerships.</p><p name="7098" id="7098" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then in 1844, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Stock_Companies_Act_1844" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Stock_Companies_Act_1844" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Joint-Stock Companies Act was passed in the UK</a>. This allowed anyone access to incorporate a joint-stock corporation. Limited Liability was still not possible for these organisations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_Liability_Act_1855" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_Liability_Act_1855" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">but eventually passed in 1855</a>.</p><p name="feec" id="feec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On both occasions, it was not without push back.</p><p name="e429" id="e429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Edward William Cox wrote in 1855:</p><blockquote name="687a" id="687a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…that there is a moral obligation, which it is the duty of the laws of a civilised nation to enforce, to pay debts, perform contracts and make reparation for wrongs. Limited liability is founded on the opposite principle and permits a man to avail himself of acts if advantageous to him, and not to be responsible for them if they should be disadvantageous; to speculate for profits without being liable for losses…”</blockquote><p name="f6bc" id="f6bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It’s reasonable concerns, but the act of limited liability reduced transaction costs for capital to flow more freely to ventures. There was still risk, but less risk. There was more access to spaghetti to throw against the walls to see what sticks.

They describe the value of tokens (such as collectibles) in its usage as tools for coordination and then describes why blockchains enable new types of social scalability.</p><p name="bbc5" id="bbc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What blockchains have done is the ability to create systems of coordination equivalent to the power of a joint-stock corporation (and greater) without the requirement of physical force to let it thrive. I refer to physical force here, as the enforcement of last resort for laws. We abide by laws due to social coordination benefits, but by not abiding by them, in the extreme results to the use of violence and force to keep it aligned.</p><p name="8d4e" id="8d4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather, blockchains allows the existence of a shared and enforceable truth by relying on crypto-economic incentives to make it costly (or impossible) to change this shared truth.

The history of humanity and its relation to technology is one where the technology also co-evolves us. It’s not so much that we domesticated grain, but that it domesticated us. He describes it as a Faustian bargain:</p><p name="c475" id="c475" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“More often than not it brought a worse diet, longer hours of work, greater risk of starvation, crowded living conditions, greatly increased susceptibility to disease, new forms of insecurity and uglier forms of hierarchy.”</p><p name="2662" id="2662" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">New technologies allow more humans to survive, but ultimate we are all worse off for it: a seemingly unstoppable feedback loop. Although the desire about building these new systems *IS* about empowerment, agency and the ability for humans to make a living in an increasingly automated world, I’m vigilant about the power of these tools in its capacity to continue the trend started with the agricultural revolution.</p><p name="1612" id="1612" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now it makes sense to say: “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if you could you earn a living from your Instagram likes?” or “Hey, doesn’t it sound interesting that your kids will make some pocket money from trading rare pepes?!”</p><p name="52f8" id="52f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">… but if that becomes the only way to subsist, the future looks strange and weird.
