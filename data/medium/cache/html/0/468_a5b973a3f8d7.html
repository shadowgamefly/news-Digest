Mind you, I still remembered some of what had been reported at the time like the “urine-soaked” police academy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/world/middleeast/06police.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/world/middleeast/06police.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">built</a> in Baghdad by an American private contractor with taxpayer dollars. But it was the cumulative effect of it all that now struck me — one damning report after another that made it clear Washington was incapable of building or rebuilding anything whatsoever. There were all those poorly constructed or unfinished military barracks, police stations, and outposts for the new national security forces the U.S. military was so eagerly “standing up” in both countries. There were the unfinished or miserably constructed schools, training centers, and “roads to nowhere.” There were those local militaries and police forces whose ranks were heavily <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175907/tomgram%3A_william_astore,_america%27s_hollow_foreign_legions" data-href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175907/tomgram%3A_william_astore,_america%27s_hollow_foreign_legions" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">populated by</a> “ghost soldiers.” There was that shiny new U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan that cost <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/boondoggle" data-href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/boondoggle" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$25 million</a> and no one wanted or would ever use. It was, in short, a litany of fiascoes and disasters that never seemed to end.</p><p name="6301" id="6301" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Financially, Washington had invested sums in both countries that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-31/afghanistan-has-cost-the-u-dot-s-dot-more-than-the-marshall-plan" data-href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-31/afghanistan-has-cost-the-u-dot-s-dot-more-than-the-marshall-plan" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">far exceeded</a> the Marshall Plan, which so successfully put Western Europe back on its feet after World War II. Yet Iraq and Afghanistan were left on their knees amid a carnival of corruption and misspent taxpayer money. What made revisiting this spectacle so stunning wasn’t just the inability of the U.S. military, the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and a crew of crony warrior corporations raking in the big bucks to do anything right, but that this was the United States of America. It was the country I — and I was hardly alone in this — had grown up thinking of as the globe’s master builder. In the 1950s and early 1960s, my childhood years, it seemed as if there was nothing Americans couldn’t build successfully from an unparalleled highway system to rockets that were moonward bound.</p><p name="ea76" id="ea76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Half a century later, it’s clear that, at least in our war zones, there’s nothing we’ve been capable of building right, no matter the dollars available.

For that Sentinel bracelet, there was a $50 startup fee, a $39 monthly “service” charge, and a $12 “daily usage” fee.

Mind you, I still remembered some of what had been reported at the time like the “urine-soaked” police academy built in Baghdad by an American private contractor with taxpayer dollars. But it was the cumulative effect of it all that now struck me — one damning report after another that made it clear Washington was incapable of building or rebuilding anything whatsoever. There were all those poorly constructed or unfinished military barracks, police stations, and outposts for the new national security forces the U.S. military was so eagerly “standing up” in both countries. There were the unfinished or miserably constructed schools, training centers, and “roads to nowhere.” There were those local militaries and police forces whose ranks were heavily populated by “ghost soldiers.” There was that shiny new U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan that cost $25 million and no one wanted or would ever use.

In 2013, the city’s general revenues totaled $2 million, 17% percent from such fines and fees.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":190,"end":198,"href":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/us/lawsuit-accuses-missouri-city-of-fining-homeowners-to-raise-revenue.html?emc=edit_th_20151105&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=65427895","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":353,"end":366,"href":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/us/lawsuit-accuses-missouri-city-of-fining-homeowners-to-raise-revenue.html?emc=edit_th_20151105&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=65427895","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":0,"end":637}]},{"name":"6d85","type":6,"text":"Might such kleptocratic local revenue-extraction systems, however, be limited to just one Midwestern state? Consider then the cozy relationship that Augusta, capital of Georgia, has with Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. That company makes electronic monitoring equipment used by state and local government agencies, ranging from the Los Angeles County Probation Department to the Massachusetts Office of the Commissioner of Probation. Its website touts the benefits to municipalities of what it calls “offender-funded programs” in which the person on probation pays the company directly for his or her own monitoring, saving the courts the cost of administering a probation system. In return, the company sets its own fees at whatever level it chooses. “By individually assessing each participant a fee based on income,” says Sentinel, “our sliding-fee scale approach has shifted the financial burden to the participant, allowing program growth and size to be a function of correctional need rather than budget availability.”","markups":[{"type":3,"start":187,"end":218,"href":"http://www.sentrak.com/faqs/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":0,"end":1025}]},{"name":"a5c8","type":6,"text":"“Profiting from Probation,” a 2014 Human Rights Watch report, offers a typical tale of an Augusta resident named Michael Barrett. Arrested for shoplifting a can of beer, he entered a local court system that was focused on revenue extraction via a kind of official extortion, which is the definition of corruption. Even to step into a courtroom to deal with his “case,” he had to hand over an $80 fee for a court-appointed defense lawyer. Then, convicted, he would be sentenced to a $200 fine and probation. Because the charge was “alcohol-related,” the court required Barrett to wear an electronic bracelet that would monitor his alcohol consumption, even though his sentence placed no restrictions on his drinking. For that Sentinel bracelet, there was a $50 startup fee, a $39 monthly “service” charge, and a $12 “daily usage” fee. In total, he was forced to pay about $400 a month to monitor something he was legally allowed to do. Since Barrett couldn’t even pay the startup fee, he was promptly thrown in jail for a month until a friend lent him the money.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":54,"end":60,"href":"http://perma.cc/K6WC-T2XT","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":0,"end":1061}]},{"name":"507f","type":6,"text":"Such systems of privatized “justice” that bleed the poor are now spreading across the U.S., a country officially without debtor’s prisons.

In Washington, D.C., on the other hand, for “certain traffic and a number of lower level criminal offenses,” you can simply pay your arresting officer “to end a case on the spot,” avoiding lengthy and expensive court costs.

Unlike criminal asset forfeiture, which permits the government to seize a person’s assets after conviction of a crime, civil forfeiture allows local, state, or federal law enforcement to seize and keep someone’s money or other property even if he or she is never charged. If, say, you are suspected of involvement with drugs or terrorism, the police can seize all the money you have on you on the spot, even if they don’t arrest you — and you have to go to court to get it back.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":362,"end":384,"href":"http://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit/introduction/#citation_32","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":0,"end":897}]},{"name":"ead4","type":6,"text":"Federal asset forfeiture collections have risen from around $800 million in 2002 to almost $4.5 billion in 2014, according to the Institute for Justice (IJ).

But all too often, it’s poor people whose money is “forfeited,” even when they’ve committed no crime. The Pennsylvania ACLU reported that police take around a million dollars from Philadelphians each year in 6,000 separate cases — and not from drug lords either. More than half the cases involve seizures of less than $192, and in a city that’s only 43% black, 71% of those seizures from people charged with no crimes come from African Americans.
