Goal setting is an article by itself, and today many teams and institutions use a variant of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> SMART framework</a> (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound), shared almost fifty years ago in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Management Review</em>, to come up with good goals for the period ahead. XO Group product teams balance overall topline company goals (e.g. user and member growth, revenue growth, user NPS) with squad-specific goals (e.g. page load time improvement, increased number of guests RSVPing per wedding, increased number of wedding venue tours, etc.)</p><p name="ad33" id="ad33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many XO Group product teams created SMART goals that set them up for success, but a few tripped up on their initial goals and direction that slowed those teams’ impact this year. Here are some goal challenges we’ve battled at XO that also frequently appear at other great NYC tech companies:</p><p name="b12f" id="b12f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrong goals get in the way of product impact</strong></p><p name="bc23" id="bc23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At XO Group and across CPO discussions, we don’t always think hard enough or get the right buy in that our product management goals are the most valuable. We sometimes measure user funnel behavior without getting to a user outcome. We sometimes set a goal without understanding if we can operationalize the results. (Can customer support handle new user behavior?) It’s important to think through what happens if we achieve these goals. Is the goal is midway point, a signal of success, or success itself? One XO product team set a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal) to deepen our relationships with our user through new tools that don’t exist anywhere. The BHAG team was so focused on hitting its goal, which they did, that they missed seeing how BHAG risks sending users to a digital no man’s land due to user flow problems. Towards the end of the year, as we approached the BHAG goal, we realized our information architecture challenge and changed user pathing … though the BHAG product itself needed to change as well.</p><p name="1273" id="1273" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the <a href="http://nyproductconference.com/" data-href="http://nyproductconference.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New York Product Conference</a>, Oscar Salazar, founder of Pager, Uber, and other great startups, stressed the point of investing enough time and though on setting the right goals and metrics. He used in-app chat as an example — would success be longer chats or shorter ones, more or fewer? Some teams assume that more time spent in an app shows success, but if the app’s goal is for a user to achieve a task (get appropriate medical help, in Pager’s case), more time could be a signal of a longer-than-necessary process. Pager took several months to get to the right goal and metric; getting this metric right greatly improved user success and happiness. The Knot mobile app launched a chat experience this year, and the team used chat length as an early engagement metric. In our case this metric made sense, but we vigorously debated the topic.</p><p name="5bf2" id="5bf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Too many goals get in the way of product impact</strong></p><p name="5fd7" id="5fd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With too many goals, teams can prioritize incorrectly or suffer decision fatigue, ultimately not moving any of the many metrics in a meaningful way. Unfortunately one of my teams spun in circles this year attacking too many problems.</p><p name="a3f4" id="a3f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Teams commonly unintentionally combine goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) with other monitored metrics, giving the appearance (and operational reality) of too many goals. Be careful not to confuse the two! Are KPIs and other metrics communicated equally (e.g. in status emails), investigated with equal urgency, given equal air time in team meetings, or managed to equally? Teams should elevate and focus on KPIs to avoid too many goals.</p><p name="0563" id="0563" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Side note: </em>KPIs and metrics are two different things. We can measure many, many things (thank you MixPanel and Google Analytics!) though we only truly have a few critical goals. Best practice is to focus on KPIs but also consider other metrics for either system health monitoring (page load time, specific funnel step performance) or for investigating user behavior.</p><p name="41b6" id="41b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With too many goals, stakeholders start to gloss over what’s really important and may struggle to understand and best support a team. When a team’s weekly email shows a dozen metrics, my CEO has emailed me more than once asking what’s actually going on.</p><p name="a263" id="a263" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Unclear goals get in the way of product impact</strong></p><p name="9f76" id="9f76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some of our XO innovation projects (such as our wedding concierge chatbot), goals were too vague for longer than necessary.

We sometimes spend design and engineering efforts on products that won’t move the needle enough. We sometimes iterate around a weak solution “to do the full process” rather than forcing a signal quickly and bolding changing direction to better reach our goal. Have you heard yourself or someone else ask for “one more AB test” to see if a mediocre product can suddenly deliver a tremendous outcome?

Sometimes you’ll need to spend extra effort going back to measure, or implementing a holdback test, to gain that learning, and you’ll need to get your team to buy into spending that energy.</li><li name="7030" id="7030" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Bonus points — learn as much as you can from your failures to increase team learning to make better decisions in the future!</li><li name="bf10" id="bf10" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Of course, have rules about how flexible your team can move to achieve goals.

If not, it can be uncomfortable for a product manager to convince a team to change direction before it is ready. Especially if the team members are conflict averse.</li></ul><h3 name="dc49" id="dc49" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Too much focus on process gets in the way of product impact</h3><p name="6267" id="6267" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Best practice product management follows a well-tested process, and we spend a lot of energy training our teams on this process so they follow it well. (Learn agile! Prototype! AB test!) That said, great product managers also know how to get early signals during product discovery and adjust quickly to get to stronger results. Less tenured or confident product managers cling to the process, and complete it fully, before getting a signal that a product achieves its goal. Some parts of product exploration and development can’t be rushed, though with experience and an outcome mindset product managers learn how to accelerate and change team velocity mid-product development.</p><p name="2d61" id="2d61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sometimes see or hear about product managers leaning on process as a crutch for inserting more urgency and rigor. I’ve been guilty of letting process comfort slow my teams down several times before. Process should support the goal, not the other way around!</p><p name="88c5" id="88c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jon Stross, co-founder of Greenhouse and the original product manager of BabyCenter two decades ago, mentioned at the New York Product Conference that tools have gotten so much better over the last twenty years, but it’s still just as easy to get lost in the trees and not see the forest. He encourages product managers to add rigor of checking in regularly about if a team is solving problems measurably, with urgency.</p><p name="82b9" id="82b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By appropriately focusing on the product management goal more than the process, and accepting the discomfort of having to learn quickly and decide quickly, most teams can move faster in a smart way. This rigor is hard, so team members should hold each other accountable, and PMs can lean on their managers for help.</p><h3 name="a777" id="a777" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cognitive biases get in the way of product impact</h3><p name="933e" id="933e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cognitive biases</a> challenge many parts of product development.

Unfortunately, sometimes tracking breaks down.</p><p name="26d1" id="26d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we don’t know about broken analytics, teams could go in any direction. When metrics are *really* broken, teams can more easily sniff out illogical results. When metrics break but retain some logic, teams can follow a false north star for weeks or months. Don’t let this happen to you!</p><p name="1924" id="1924" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we know our KPI tracking is broken, teams have to make the hard choice of top goal imperfectly measured vs. secondary goal perfectly measured until regaining clean tracking, and there is no easy answer here. Unfortunately, teams sometimes turn to easy-to-track relatively unimportant metrics, especially when the team has too many goals. When tracking broke for an XO team team, they spent three months using proxy metrics and lowered page load time and tech debt, and unfortunately neither moved a primary or secondary KPI even though they seemed like good ideas.</p><p name="6b34" id="6b34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p><figure name="4230" id="4230" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 466px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*odDrf3s5Pb7lacEx." data-width="1280" data-height="852" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*odDrf3s5Pb7lacEx." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*odDrf3s5Pb7lacEx."></div></figure><p name="da94" id="da94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As I look at this year’s performance across XO Group’s twenty product squads, those that performed best had a clear measurable goal, shared outcome urgency as a team, and felt empowered to maneuver to hit their goals. I’m grateful to my old boss Vish Makhijani, CEO of Udacity and former COO of Zynga, for drilling that rigor into me. The XO teams that performed worse either had weak goals, as mentioned above, were too wedded (pun!) to the process to move quickly enough, or failed to explicitly get all team members onboard an outcome-oriented culture.</p><p name="aa63" id="aa63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In 2017, we hope to set stronger product management goals and move with urgency to achieve them.

One XO product team set a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal) to deepen our relationships with our user through new tools that don’t exist anywhere. The BHAG team was so focused on hitting its goal, which they did, that they missed seeing how BHAG risks sending users to a digital no man’s land due to user flow problems.

Some teams assume that more time spent in an app shows success, but if the app’s goal is for a user to achieve a task (get appropriate medical help, in Pager’s case), more time could be a signal of a longer-than-necessary process. Pager took several months to get to the right goal and metric; getting this metric right greatly improved user success and happiness. The Knot mobile app launched a chat experience this year, and the team used chat length as an early engagement metric.
