My symptoms vary wildly from day to day but most often I have trouble walking, but can stand okay, so I use a Segway miniPro (<a href="http://twitter.com/SegwayInc" data-href="http://twitter.com/SegwayInc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Twitter profile for @SegwayInc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@SegwayInc</a>) &amp; cane.

On Friday, March 3, we headed to Newark Liberty airport for our flight to San Diego, where we’d embark on the <a href="https://jococruise.com/" data-href="https://jococruise.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">JoCo Cruise</a> — which some have described as a 7-day floating Comic-con/music festival. Some of my and my new husband Connor’s favorite podcasters, musicians, authors, and artists would be there. We would have been excited even if this <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hadn’t</em> also just so happened to be our honeymoon.</p><p name="4f84" id="4f84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We got to the airport, checked in, and I rode the Segway to security and put it through the X-ray (TSA got the memo, apparently), took it to gate, and notified the gate agent we needed preboarding.</p><p name="a3a1" id="a3a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At gate call, we were first in line, but they said we had to wait while they “checked on something”. We waited while pre-boarding concluded, but then I told my husband to go ahead and board (we had first-class tickets — it was our honeymoon, remember — so he had boarding priority even without me), in order to save overhead room for the Segway with a bag.</p><p name="d738" id="d738" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I waited as they finished priority boarding and had proceeded through the next couple boarding groups, then the agent said I couldn’t carry it on, and I couldn’t gate check it, because it “wasn’t allowed”. I asked if they’d seen that notation in my itinerary. They said they had, and it indeed showed my prior call.</p><p name="f9b9" id="f9b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they said it read: “passenger was advised he would <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">NOT</strong> be allowed to board with device, and the device will not have to be checked, provided he can place device in overhead without crew assistance. Transferred passenger to TSA for clearance of device through security.” It seemed obvious that the “not” there was a typo — the rest of the annotation doesn’t make <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">any</em> sense otherwise! I tried to explain that logic to them, but they were unyielding.</p><p name="6246" id="6246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I called the Special Needs desk and the rep reviewed the record and agreed, that was just a typo, I could carry it on. I handed my phone to the agent.</p><blockquote name="076e" id="076e" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We don’t allow hoverboards, they’re fire risks… We don’t even allow <em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">Samsung phones, we definitely won’t allow that.</em>”</blockquote><p name="edf5" id="edf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">After speaking to the rep, the gate agent said a “manager” had to decide. We waited a bit—by this time, everyone in the gate area had boarded—then the manager came and said no. “We don’t allow hoverboards, they’re fire risks.”</p><p name="4ea2" id="4ea2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I explained that it’s a Segway, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> a hoverboard, it’s UL-certified for fire safety (with a hologram-seal certification on bottom stating this — I showed it to them), and one has never spontaneously combusted like those cheap hoverboards everyone was buying a couple years ago did.

A telescoping handle pops out the top so you can guide it around when you aren’t riding it.</p><p name="7c7e" id="7c7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can step on with either foot (I do this with the help of my cane), and it beeps to let you know it’s now balancing you; you step fully onto it. Then, when you lean forward, it goes forward; lean back, it stops and then goes backwards.</p><p name="48a8" id="48a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those cheap “hoverboards” from the 2015 craze required you to steer by shifting your weight from your left foot to your right. In a way, they do steering the same way the Segway does throttle.</p><p name="73fc" id="73fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the Segway ignores changes in side-to-side lean — I couldn’t use it otherwise, since one foot or the other is usually bothering me. Instead, you steer it by putting gentle pressure on a kneebar. The more you press, the quicker you turn. So I can use it, even if I can put little to no weight on one side.</p><p name="deb4" id="deb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Compared to many other mobility options like that scooter rental, the Segway’s control is a) intuitive, b) analog, and c) exquisite. Let me explain:</p><p name="45dc" id="45dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">INTUITIVE</em></strong>: I’ve let friends try it. I’ve let friends’ kids try it. I’ve let people on the sidewalk try it. I’ve even once — carefully!—let a stranger I met on the street, who had a similar form of arthritis to mine and was walking with crutches, give it a try.</p><p name="efc1" id="efc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It feels weird for the first ten or fifteen seconds; people tend to rock back and forth a bit, so I offer them my arm while they get used to it. Then your brain clicks, and you stop “driving” it. Within minutes, you stop “riding” it. You just go where you want to go. Like walking, you don’t think about the mechanics; you just think about what you want to do, and it does it.</p><p name="169b" id="169b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If an obstacle suddenly appears — a door opens in front of you, someone walking ahead stops abruptly to pick up something they’ve dropped — your natural startle reflex, to straighten up and lean back — stops you, nearly instantly. When I’ve had friends’ kids try it, after they get the hang of it and are zooming around happily, I tell them to try passing where I’m standing at full speed. Then, at the last moment, I step in front of them and put out a hand. They stop as quickly, as automatically, and with as little danger to either of us as if they were walking by and I’d done the same.</p><p name="4be8" id="4be8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The point is, this thing is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">safe</em>.</p><p name="9a24" id="9a24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ANALOG</em></strong>: At full-tilt, the Segway goes up to about 13 mph. I very, very rarely go that fast. I just match whatever walking speed I need to for the people around me. I’ve gotten more comments from onlookers in New York City amazed how <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">slowly</em> I can go, creeping around Times Square throngs. I can go any speed I want.</p><p name="4e59" id="4e59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">EXQUISITE</em></strong>: The precision I have is hard to describe, and for people around me who haven’t seen one before, it can be hard to believe (particularly when I tell them it didn’t take practice). I can do a 360° turn in place. I can back out of a corner, turn, and continue without a stop. (When I turn it on after it’s been propped against a wall while I’ve been sitting, I don’t even bother to guide it away from the wall; I just hop on, turn in place, and ride away.)</p><p name="69a9" id="69a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can stay in place talking to someone for minutes. (Its battery life is many hours with normal use, and it uses “regenerative braking”, meaning rather than traditional brakes, it just sends power back to the battery to stop.) I can navigate a narrow NYC drugstore with a basket, go through the checkout line, pay, and leave without stepping off. Its width is less than my own elbow-to-elbow, so anywhere I can go, it can go. I have to find wheelchair ramps and elevators, but besides that I can pretty much go anywhere. And when I run into a curb without a ramp, its under-30-pound weight makes it possible to just step off and lift it up the curb.</p><p name="a1d8" id="a1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went to a conference last December with the Segway. It was just like being able-bodied — I could mingle at cocktail parties, navigate through densely-packed tables, go through the buffet line, carry drinks.</p><p name="ce52" id="ce52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was thrilling and freeing. It was worlds better than crutches, even my expensive custom set — my hands were free, I didn’t have to watch where I planted them, and I wasn’t exhausted at the end of the day.</p><p name="d02e" id="d02e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This scooter I’d just rented was nothing like that.</p></div></div></section><section name="857f" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="dfd9" id="dfd9" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--leading">I felt humiliated and burdensome, again and again.</blockquote><p name="d8cc" id="d8cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The scooter was clunky as hell. It was the kind you see on commercials and in grocery stores: one front wheel connected to a tiller, two back wheels, with a cushy chair mounted on a big platform in between. It had handlebars with a lever in the middle. The lever had basically three speeds: forward, stop, and reverse. There was a dial in the middle you needed a second hand for to control the speed. But it wasn’t natural to hold on to it all the time, so it tended to be something I’d adjust when circumstances changed.</p><figure name="4c00" id="4c00" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 475px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 90.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q31WOS47FtmlOtLcpEMivg.jpeg" data-width="1132" data-height="1024" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*q31WOS47FtmlOtLcpEMivg.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q31WOS47FtmlOtLcpEMivg.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">A fancier scooter than the rental, but same basic idea.

To get over the door jam into my cabin, I had to have the throttle dialed up pretty high — but then I needed to remember to turn the dial way down once I’d cleared it, otherwise I’d crash headlong into the sofa. Which I did, repeatedly. And I ran over my husband’s foot at least twice doing just that. The obvious thing — letting go of the pressure on the lever like it was a gas pedal — did nothing to slow it down until it would suddenly stop.</p><p name="b37c" id="b37c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I needed help with doors. I couldn’t turn around in the narrow ship passageways — if I overshot my destination, I had to continue all the way to the next bank of elevators and turn around. I never mastered turning in reverse.</p><p name="eb2a" id="eb2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It had a basket I could carry things in, but I needed both hands to drive it, so even carrying a drink ten feet or getting my own food was impossible, or something I’d have to hobble on my cane to do.</p><p name="6583" id="6583" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All week, I felt like a burden on my husband and an inconvenience to other passengers and the crew. I kept making other passengers miss elevators, because I couldn’t get out and clear fast enough before the doors shut. Places with two or three steps — places I could have easily stepped off the Segway and guided it manually over — were insurmountable obstacles with the scooter’s 150-pound weight.</p><p name="7b9b" id="7b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A couple times, I “turtled” it going over a hatchway ramp, both its front and rear wheels in the air. It was so heavy that the only way I could get it free the time this happened and I was alone was to get off it, put all my weight on the chair back with my elbows, turn the throttle to max and hit the drive button so it would jump over— very nearly crushing my fingers against a bulkhead in the process.</p><p name="fc88" id="fc88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">never</em> felt safe with the thing. When I’m around small children with the Segway, I’m careful—but only to avoid startling them or their parents, I’ve never had the slightest worry of hurting them. On the scooter, I had a couple close calls with children too little to see in my blind spot that left me shaken.</p><p name="9a21" id="9a21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We couldn’t go on excursions we would have been able to with the Segway. A lot of excursions can handle someone with a mobility device they can lift themselves, but very few had the people or equipment to deal with a 150-pound vehicle.</p><p name="abac" id="abac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And “tendering” — getting to shore by way of little shuttle boats in ports that can’t accommodate huge ships — was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">such</em> an ordeal, dealing with winches and tiny service elevators I had to use alone — we just stayed on the ship once, giving up our only chance for a lay on the beach. It was just too much trouble.

I was just scraped and winded, but it was very scary — probably more for my husband than for me. (It’s really okay, honey. You did great and I love you.) Someone who saw this got a HAL crewman (the ship’s IT guy!) who pushed me the rest of the way — which was a good thing, too, because we had to detour across the entire ship to get to a working elevator.</p><p name="47c7" id="47c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’d planned a day in San Diego, but with my mobility now limited to a cane, we just went to the movies instead.
