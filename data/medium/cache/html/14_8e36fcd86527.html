That happens automatically if you do the above.</p><p name="d474" id="d474" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another thing I didn’t say, “Be kind to others”. This rule could be important because it helps you build your scene, which helps you build your “EQUALS” described above.</p><p name="44e7" id="44e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This also is a side effect of achieving mastery in the way described above.</p><p name="b7b6" id="b7b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I didn’t say, “Find Your Category”. This is good advice: find the area where you have no competition.

If a hitter only makes good hits 40% of the time, he will be the best player in history (Ted Williams).</p><p name="f770" id="f770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This rule is a side effect of having a good coach and good equals and good psychology.</p><p name="e52a" id="e52a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I should say this though: if you are on track 100% of the time then you aren’t taking enough risks.</p><p name="d727" id="d727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But let’s not focus too much on failure. Let’s just focus on improvement.</p><p name="9d38" id="9d38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When making a guidebook of rules to follow, I like to stick to ten things. Else it’s too much.
