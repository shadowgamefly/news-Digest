Background: <a href="https://human.parts/calebs-voice-a7aca47b656" data-href="https://human.parts/calebs-voice-a7aca47b656" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my younger brother, Caleb</a>, has autism. His 1–1 aid, Nancy, has been in his life since he was just a wee thing. Even after he graduated she has stayed in his life because she’s a literal angel.</p><p name="2144" id="2144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, when Sen. Murphy ended by telling the story of a young boy with autism who was murdered at Sandy Hook; how his aid, Anne Marie Murphy, held him in his final moments before they both died — I lost it. I could no longer keep down the mounting feelings of anguish that I swallow whenever mass shootings happen in this country. I didn’t just cry, I got angry.</p><p name="4baf" id="4baf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Up until now, every shooting that happens in this country, I’ve felt a little more desensitized. I gape in horror at the live news coverage but there’s a part of me that has just gone completely numb to the suffering. It happens far too much, there is no time to recover from the mourning of the last before the next one happens.</p><p name="4bbe" id="4bbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This ongoing argument is not about gun ownership; it’s much broader than that. It’s about our entire <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">culture.</em> If you become defensive at this issue because you think someone is trying to take your gun away, then shut you’re fucking ridiculous mouth. This is not about that. Gun Control legislation is trying to make sure that people who own guns are owning them for reasonable, sound-of-mind reasons.</p><p name="4e62" id="4e62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like what, you ask?</p><p name="f944" id="f944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you collect them, that’s cool. I have friends who are hobbyists, and their collections are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">remarkable</em>.</p><p name="a1d4" id="a1d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you target shoot or <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Skeet_shooting" data-href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Skeet_shooting" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">skeet shoot,</a> great, I’ve done it! I’m terrible at it, but it’s a lot of fucking fun.</p><p name="e50f" id="e50f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are a hunter —especially in Maine, where I’m from, — then I can almost guarantee that you are among some of the most well-educated and well self-regulated gun owners in our state; probably in our nation. You know how to safely handle a firearm. You clean it and care for it, you take pride in it. You teach your children SAFETY FIRST AND ALWAYS. You look out for those in your hunting teams, you keep one another safe. Because a gun, no matter what, is a weapon capable of taking a life. The hunters I know know this. They never forget for a moment how powerful a gun is.</p><p name="03e3" id="03e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And accidents happen. I have known far too many young people who have died this way. When young people are not taught gun safety, when they feel invincible, terrible things happen. Stupid, awful, terrible things happen.</p></div></div></section><section name="5081" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="45ad" id="45ad" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading"><span class="graf-dropCap">G</span>un control is<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> kind of</em> about that. It’s also, more specifically, about making sure that when this country manufactures and sells guns, it is accountable for who ends up owning them. So much of what is being asked is simply common sense: if you are on a no-fly list, you should not be able to buy a gun. Background checks are not about taking guns away from people who obtained them lawfully, they’re about making sure that people who may intend to use them <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">unlawfully</em> do not get <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to </em>obtain them.</p><p name="2154" id="2154" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">many </em>friends who own guns for self defense. I have lived in homes where guns were kept in case of a break-in. In Maine especially, many of us grew up in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">very </em>rural areas. If someone had thought to break into our house in the night, no amount of screaming would have helped us. If we had called 911, the town police would have taken too long to get there because we lived <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">out in the fucking boonies. </em>Whether your family had handguns on their nightstand, a rifle behind the door or a fucking <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">longsword</em> — yeah, chances are you had some kind of mechanism of defense if you lived ten miles outta town with no neighbors. I mean <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">shit</em>, sometimes it wasn’t even PEOPLE breaking in. Sometimes it was LEGIT BEARS.</p><p name="1b64" id="1b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having a gun, for many families, was absolutely a protective measure. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES I KNEW PRAYED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER. HAVE. TO. USE. THAT. GUN</strong>. There wasn’t this sense of bravado, they didn’t brag. A lot of them kept them extremely well-hidden, their children may not have even known there were guns in the house to begin with. These people didn’t have guns so they could exploit the Second Amendment on every fucking breath; they had guns because the were extremely educated on how to keep, use, and protect that firearm.</p><p name="5dc5" id="5dc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if, at some point, they were in danger, they wanted to have some kind of way to protect their family. BUT THEY WERE NOT VIGILANTES. Most of these people, if asked, would have said that they would not shoot to kill — it was just to buy them some time so that they could escape, or the police could arrive — THESE PEOPLE DID NOT DREAM OF BECOMING MURDERERS.</p><p name="a00e" id="a00e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But what you have to understand is that there are also people who DO have these dreams. And because of how incredibly easy it is to obtain a gun in this country, they are able to achieve this dream in living color, while we all watch helplessly. We say they were terrorists or mentally ill. Sometimes they are. And that begs the question: then why the hell did the American people, who have a palpable distrust of both of these groups, sell them a god damn firearm?</p></div></div></section><section name="c0b9" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a4e4" id="a4e4" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading"><span class="graf-dropCap">A</span>merica has to have some accountability.
