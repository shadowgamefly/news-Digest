You have Bose wireless on, tuning out the city that you *love* but never want to hear at 6PM on a Wednesday. You’re carrying your MacBook Pro inside of a neutral-colored Herschel bag, which are made by artisans (a few thousand factory workers) practicing their traditional Saskatchewan (Guangzhou, Chinese) craftsmanship (of hipster fabric manipulation). These tourists are not wearing any of these things.</p><p name="f34c" id="f34c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chinese tour groups are large.</p><p name="f551" id="f551" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Always a Greyhound’s worth, at a minimum.</p><p name="0aac" id="0aac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They’re loud. I mean, just listen to them shout so… <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">foreignly.</em> Especially in restaurants. They wave little flags. They wear those red, or blue, or otherwise brightly colored hats. They pile on chartered busses and take over hotels.</p><p name="1d0c" id="1d0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why do they spend so much of their time in the Apple Store? Why aren’t they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">exploring</em>? Don’t they have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lonely Planets</em> in China? God, I really admire Anthony Bourdain.

The People’s Liberation Army and your comrades north of the Yalu River just defeated the Evil Empire in the War of Korean Liberation.</p><p name="0ec4" id="0ec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re named Ping, which means Peace. Millions born in your time are also homages to peace.</p><p name="539d" id="539d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s 1960. You’re six years old and the eldest of four. The family learns that your mom’s cousin in the nearby village just died. Mom and Dad told you that he got sick. Later you learn that he died of starvation along with 50 million other comrades in what was the largest man-made disaster in history.</p><p name="6c61" id="6c61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A famine of more-than-biblical proportions.</p><p name="c47b" id="c47b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As an adult you calculate that this would be like everyone in California and Illinois dying in four short — yet unimaginably long — years.</p><p name="6458" id="6458" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You and your brothers get one egg each to eat as your protein for the week. Your parents’ protein intake is de-prioritized. This is because you live in the provincial capital of Henan and because your family is prosperous. You guiltily savor your friends’ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">jealousy </em>of your single egg. Even though The Great Famine rages in the country-side — which is to say most of China — you get animal protein.</p><p name="5176" id="5176" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You feel like an emperor when you see that precious yolk every Sunday evening.</p><p name="4792" id="4792" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You never leave a kernel of rice on your plate, and it never occurs to you to complain about dinner.</p><p name="2815" id="2815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s 1970. You’re 16 years old. You’re regularly bullied because your mother was a teacher, and your father was a principal. They shut down all schools except for elementary ones four years ago at the start of the Cultural Revolution, so the spit on the back of your head is from the neighborhood children and adults, not your classmates.</p><p name="c3dc" id="c3dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your family is considered part of the intelligentsia class. Your peers are part of the Red Guard. They spy on families and tell the local Communist Party members which neighbors are not adhering to the thousands of dictates and philosophies described in the Chairman’s Red Book.</p><p name="0c21" id="0c21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You never know when you might run afoul of The Little Red Book.</p><p name="5044" id="5044" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s so such thing as civil society any more. Family members barely trust one another. Let alone neighbors. Let alone strangers.</p><p name="6304" id="6304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day, they come for you.</p><p name="b3a0" id="b3a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re sent to a labor camp. Like your appreciation of your Sunday eggs, you’re thankful for how lucky you are! You only have to go 50 miles away from home. But you’ve never been more than five miles away from the apartment block, so it might as well be the Gobi.</p><p name="3c4b" id="3c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re taught that every spade shoveled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">from the earth</em> helps liberate people <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">of</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the Earth</em>. You learn that every brick you lay is one step closer to a palatial communist paradise.</p><p name="3f03" id="3f03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You believe it.

For what purpose you’re not sure, but you decide to study English. You find a tattered textbook. The only other comrade in your battalion who reads is a Uighur; a Muslim minority group from central Asia and China. While you practice your vowels and consonants, he reads and recites the Quran. He does this in secret since religion is banned. You say nothing to others in the camp. Both of you struggle to see below the flickering 40 watt street lamp, which is the only one in a two mile radius.</p><p name="c5a9" id="c5a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You do this every night for six years.</p><p name="23ef" id="23ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s 1976.
