The most important confusing thing to happen this week has been an ongoing battle of branches of government, occasionally with extra bonus infighting within the Executive Branch. Bear with me, because this is lengthy and confusing and I barely understand half of it despite studying law for a living: After Trump passed his extreme immigration executive order last Friday, federal judges around the country were happy to oblige the advocates launching into action. This resulted in holdings legally prohibiting first the practice of detaining lawful permanent residents, then the practice of denying detained people access to attorneys, and then ultimately almost all the provisions of the executive order. You would think that all of these holdings would make executive staff change their practices, and in some cases, you would be right; Homeland Security officially exempted lawful permanent residents after the first court holding. But in some cases, you would be fascinatingly, disturbingly wrong. Customs and Border Protections agents have continued to deny people access to attorneys (which eventually prompted the Virginia AG to file a motion to hold them in contempt, though the judge declined to grant it), and reports also began trickling in that CBP agents were coercing people to sign paperwork giving up their LPR status so that they could then be legally deported. This mixed posture can be partially explained by an apparent disagreement between Secretary Kelly and Steve Bannon, which thankfully did not end particularly well for Bannon, as well as some Department of State action that may or may not have been following the Executive pied piper. It was presumably not approved by Donald Trump himself, who largely handled this by tweeting about how the Seattle judge will be overturned (showing that he should give up his new career in fortunetelling, because the Ninth Circuit immediately proved him wrong). Oh, but he also did fire the acting Attorney General over all of this, after she declined to enforce the unlawful provisions of the Executive Order, saying that she “betrayed” the country over the (already found not to be lawful) “legal” order she didn’t enforce. So, you know. That’s happening. And will presumably be an ongoing saga for a while, especially if Trump’s continuous statements are any indication.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":409,"end":436,"href":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":450,"end":457,"href":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/2-iraqis-file-lawsuit-after-being-detained-in-ny-due-to-travel-ban/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":458,"end":464,"href":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-lawsuit-idUSKBN15C0JP?il=0","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":465,"end":471,"href":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":472,"end":483,"href":"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-washington-state-lawsuit-trump-travel-ban-20170130-story.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":594,"end":646,"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":653,"end":712,"href":"http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/29/14430082/four-federal-courts-ruled-trump-immigration-ban","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":734,"end":782,"href":"http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/judge-to-hear-states-lawsuit-against-trumps-immigration-ban-friday/490555631","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":935,"end":981,"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/white-house-official-in-reversal-says-green-card-holders-wont-be-barred.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1136,"end":1167,"href":"https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/01/29/customs-and-border-protection-still-not-allowing-lawyers-to-see-detainees/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1214,"end":1252,"href":"http://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/over-100000-visas-revoked-government-lawyer-says-in-virginia-court","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1351,"end":1411,"href":"http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/01/30/68577/lax-immigration-agents-asked-detainees-to-sign-awa/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1506,"end":1571,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/02/04/the-white-house-cabinet-battle-over-trumps-immigration-ban/?postshare=6481486213057776&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.701142244ea8","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1643,"end":1674,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-dept-reverses-visa-revocations-allows-banned-travelers-to-enter-us/2017/02/04/0ab5880a-eaee-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.9bfef06aebe1","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1840,"end":1880,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/04/trump-lashes-out-at-federal-judge-who-temporarily-blocked-travel-ban/?utm_term=.5e0395d085d6&wpisrc=nl_evening&wpmm=1","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1955,"end":2001,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-appeals-to-restore-travel-ban-says-earlier-ruling-was-second-guessing-the-president/2017/02/05/6fcdbb5a-eb4c-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html?tid=sm_fb&utm_term=.6d65530398f9","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":2024,"end":2056,"href":"http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-justice-department-will-not-defend-1485820835-htmlstory.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":2363,"end":2414,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/05/constitutional-crisis-what-happens-if-trump-decides-to-ignore-a-judge/?utm_term=.1c70a3046380&wpisrc=nl_evening&wpmm=1","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":1,"start":0,"end":76},{"type":1,"start":144,"end":184},{"type":1,"start":186,"end":254},{"type":2,"start":351,"end":376},{"type":2,"start":1045,"end":1078}]},{"name":"dc6e","type":9,"text":"I Said Good Day, Mate!

(Maybe) True to his reality television roots, Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nomination was rolled out with a dramatic prime-time announcement on Tuesday. I’ve heard several people call the nominee, Neil Gorsuch, a Scalia clone, which appears about accurate — much like the late judge he would be replacing, this judge is socially conservative, an Originalist, protective of fourth Amendment search and seizure requirements, and, most shockingly for the Trump administration, an actual federal judge with basic qualifications. The Democratic party appears fairly split about how to handle this nomination, which seems to be something of a Xanatos gambit — either the Democrats boycott a la the Garland nomination, in which case Trump gets to nominate somebody way less palatable and qualified while bad-mouthing the Democratic base, or they play nice, in which case the Republican party has learned that sheer bloody-minded obstructionism lands them Supreme Court seats. Schumer has indicated that the Democrats might also take Secret Door #3 and filibuster the nomination, especially in light of Trump’s recent anti-Judiciary tweetfest — which was last tried (unsuccessfully) with the Alito nomination. So I guess there are plenty of potential not-so-great options.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":120,"end":154,"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-nominee.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":155,"end":165,"href":"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/30/supreme-court-trump-senate-republicans-democrats-nomination-confirmation/97097870/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":211,"end":223,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-scotus-nominees/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":225,"end":239,"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-scotus-nominees/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":320,"end":330,"href":"http://www.newsweek.com/profile-neil-gorsuch-trumps-possible-scotus-nominee-548835","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":360,"end":371,"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":651,"end":665,"href":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":697,"end":724,"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1024,"end":1084,"href":"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/senate-democrats-filibuster-supreme-court-pick-234368","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":1097,"end":1148,"href":"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/schumer-trump-judge-executive-order-scotus","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":1,"start":0,"end":21},{"type":2,"start":488,"end":537}]},{"name":"74b5","type":9,"text":"The Betsy DeVos Heisenstate: In addition to being my Negativland cover band, this is as good a descriptor as any for the neck-and-neck scramble happening on DeVos’s nomination.

The plot thickened when Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski publicly announced that they would not support the DeVos nomination, bucking the expectation of a Republican party voting bloc. From there, it became a centrist Republican telethon free-for-all, with liberals calling all kind of Republican politicians looking for a third nay voter.
