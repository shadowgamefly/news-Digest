Upward mobility for communities usually involves an established formula of low rents attracting creatives, which in turn brings in hipster young professionals and liberal young families that empower existing residents and allow neighbourhoods to thrive. Once this happens, place becomes increasingly entangled with market forces that pitch community against prosperity in a race to the bottom. <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/09/22/norman-foster-interview-london-creative-exodus-inevitable-economic-prosperity-design-architecture/" data-href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/09/22/norman-foster-interview-london-creative-exodus-inevitable-economic-prosperity-design-architecture/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nowhere does gentrification stimulate speculation as much as London</a>, a city struggling to deal with a steady exodus of young creatives and professionals priced out of the housing and rental markets. Regeneration of this kind, where thriving low income communities are displaced from an area to attract more desirable higher-earners who contribute to a positive rebranding of place is nothing new. Writing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">in a recent series in the Guardian</a>, Oliver Wainwright sums up the cycle as follows,</p><p name="13bf" id="13bf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“First come the artists, then the cranes. As the kamikaze pilots of urban renewal, wherever the creatives go, developers will follow, rents will rise, the artists will move on, and the pre-existing community will be kicked out with them.”</em></p><p name="ca25" id="ca25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I moved to London in 2004 to begin my Part II in architecture at the London Met. I remember I stayed in a hostel in ‘cool’ Camden while I traipsed the streets with my AtoZ through repetition of Victorian terraces unified by the hum of the dull grey-white horizon. I remember going to see the first house I would eventually live in. There was an older Irish lady weeping as the bus brought me down Holloway Road to Essex Road. North London had been home to the Irish for generations, but many of these had now moved out to Luton and Hertfordshire. Some weren’t as lucky as I would find out some years later. Hip Canonbury was at the more bohemian end of Angel, epicentre of the Cool Britannia set, yet far enough away from the rough edges of the city and grimey Shoreditch. The house I occupied was a pastiche addition at the end of a Georgian terrace built from architectural salvage by an eccentric West of Ireland familyman. I lived there for a year before Islington Council informed us that my ex-utility-room bedroom wasn’t fit for human inhabitation. Rents and land value in the area was also rising considerably. By that time the bohemian hip scene had migrated out from Canonbury to the leafy lefty Stoke Newington.</p><p name="ca6f" id="ca6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the decade or so I lived in London I was displaced on average about every three years. From Canonbury to Stokie, from Stokie to Clapton, if I were still in London I would be most like now in Tottenham, or god forbid, Leyton or even having to swerve the ram mafia in Walthamstow. The transience and dynamism of London neighbourhoods is often celebrated for its innovation and creativity, but when these pioneer communities are displaced, all that remains is sameness. Church St. Stoke Newington is no different now to a similar high St. in Putney or Balham. Murder Mile which was the affectionate colloquial name for my e<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ndz</em> in Clapton Pond, could probably now be called Peppa Pig Pulled Pork Pond. Gentrification in London occurs at breakneck speed, impacting the makeup of our streets both visually and socially. In fact the term originates from a phenomena first observed in North London by sociologist Ruth Glass.</p><p name="1529" id="1529" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Urban renewal laws… rightly wiping away slums and their populations, and replacing them with projects intended to produce higher tax yield, or to lure back easier populations with less expensive public requirements. The method fails… it merely shifts slums from here to there, adding its own mixture of extra hardship and disruption. At worst, it destroys neighbourhoods where constructive and improving communities exist and where the situation calls for encouragement rather than destruction”.</em></p><p name="d2f8" id="d2f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More than fifty years ago, Jane Jacobs (a recently rediscovered darling of the social left) was fighting ill-considered regeneration policy first-hand in North greenwich Village, New York. Having successfully lobbied to stop demolition of ‘failing slums in her own neighborhood, the author compiled a critique of the planning system, ‘The Death and Life of Great American Cities’ sharing tactics for resilience against local authorities and ill community considered renewal plans.</p><p name="5172" id="5172" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Modern city planning has been burdened from its beginnings with the unsuitable aim of converting cities into disciplined works of art</em>”, wrote Jacobs of the dysfunction of the planning system, built on rigid interpretations of social engineering. Of the planners themselves, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“They cannot do anything else much”</em>, thought Jacobs. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“They cannot develop alternative tactics, for the lack strategy for design that will help cities”,</em> understanding that planning needed to engage with stakeholders in developing strategic proposals around outcomes for communities. Jacob’s understood the need for holistic solutions, that help shape a more democratic and equal society, in the face of two-dimensional monotonous master-planning, ignorant of the multi-sensory complex psychogeography of our cities..</p><p name="96dd" id="96dd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“A strategy of illuminating and clarifying life and helping to explain to us its meanings and order — in this case, helping us to illuminate, clarify and explain the order of cities…. We are constantly being told simple-minded lies about order in cities, talked down to in effect, assured that duplication represents order.”</em></p><p name="6082" id="6082" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her book could not be more relevant today, pointing to the fact that our planning systems continue to be unfit for purpose, yet sheer dogmatism means that negative behaviours prevail. The points made by Jacobs resonate precisely with my own personal experience of the planning system, — working as an architect, service designer and urban planner. That is, that the planning system is broken, that it does not serve the people and citizens like it is supposed to. As mentioned in my first post, behaviour that occurs within the planning systems — among civil servants, built environment professions and developers — has served to sever any social contract between the architect or planner or citizen. The current system — built around compliance, risk and box-ticking — does little in the way of real engagement with citizens and the eventual users of cities. Yet it is by deep engagement with those who live and experience and area, in order to draw out insights n which to base plans, and strategies that take existing local assets, resources and their potential into consideration. This process is what builds ownership among citizens, leading to placemaking, place-branding and the eventual recovery of an area.</p><p name="2d90" id="2d90" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“There exists no substitute for lively street… If only well-meaning officials in departments of the city government or in freewheeling authorities knew intimately, and cared about, the street or districts which their scheme so vitally affect — or of they knew in the least what the citizens of that place consider of value in their lives and why”</em></p><p name="c061" id="c061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Echoing Jacob’s position, in his<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08k15lh" data-href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08k15lh" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> recent BBC Radio 4 documentary</a> on the 1947 planning act, Will Self lamented the lack of participatory process in planning. Something that was a cornerstone of the Act, some seventy years ago. The smug superiority of being resident at the cutting edge of urban renewal, fades away as soon affluent young professionals begin to shun the no-holes barred no-named bar becomes a tight-knitting circle. Where it’s at, quickly becomes where it shat and the cycle of gentrification sets off in another part of town, where the local migrants are more exotic, and the warehouses have not yet become pentecostal churches. Gentrification is what we call positive (mostly organic examples) of urban renewal. Places that seem to linger in a suspended animation of stagnation, often sink deeper into decline are not considered to have gentrified. Jacob’s draws attention to the role of local government in renewal and regeneration, and how the system seems not to learn from mistakes, but keeps churning out replacement development without ever addressing the root causes of deprivation. As we are learning, buildings don’t fix society’s challenges, and that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“when we try to justify good shelter instead on the pretentious grounds that it will work social or family miracles we fool ourselves.”</em></p><figure name="c8b6" id="c8b6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WTZoreuldvCqobutWFc9fg@2x.jpeg" data-width="2448" data-height="3264" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*WTZoreuldvCqobutWFc9fg@2x.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WTZoreuldvCqobutWFc9fg@2x.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="dcd4" id="dcd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Gentrification would seem to be accepted more and more as a natural occurrence of a city, a phenomena that demonstrates the living, breathing nature of our cities, how they change over time. Cities and local government have long sought to intervene in areas of significant deprivation to look at architecture and the built environment as the tool in which to empower community and lift them out of poverty. But can buildings really perform this role? What is it that buildings actually do?</p><p name="48f9" id="48f9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“The silliest conception of salvage is to build a duplicate of the first failure and move the people from the first failure into it’s expensive duplicate so the first failure can be salvaged”.</em></p><p name="f834" id="f834" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is the social infrastructure and networked resilience that allows other communities to thrive? Are local authority and planning professionals doing enough to understand what processes mean for regenerated neighbourhoods — what community resources and assets must be strengthened and ‘illuminated’ to allow community to attain sustainable upward mobility, to retain the diversity that makes them special and unique communities where people want to live.</p><p name="5b02" id="5b02" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“So many of the conflicts would never occur if planners and other supposed experts understood in the least how cities work and respected those working… much of what they need to know they can learn from noone but the people of the place, because nobody else knows enough about it… they must understand… specific places”</em></p><p name="1dd0" id="1dd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The built-environment contributes to placemaking for sure, it provides the furniture and cues that set the scene on our daily lives. Yet increasingly technology and services impact much more on our personal and social development as humans. Modern life is experienced through much more than physical architecture, through interactions and experiences with platforms and networked communities. Technology is also allowing us to communicate better with each other and make more informed decisions on our collective futures and share environment. Technology is providing the built environment professions and planning in particular with new tools to model future communities and test scenarios in open and agile ways with communities. This includes planning portals that map resources allow us to make collective informed decisions.</p><p name="59e3" id="59e3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“… automatic selection of what was destroyed…. Allowing that what is worth more to remain — is utterly missing from current city rebuilding tactics…”</em></p><p name="7e12" id="7e12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet with all this possibility we still seem to be remarkably constrained. <a href="http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project/future-of-planning/" data-href="http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project/future-of-planning/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">In the future</a>, planning will need to embrace technology as a channel to collect data and insights from real people with real experience of place. Writing in his book <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Postcapitalism</em> — which I introduced in the previous post — the economist Paul Mason notes how that, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“infrastructure planning remains one of the disciplines least transformed by networked thinking. This needs to change”</em>. Planning professionals — complicated by the local authority planning systems, consultation process round LAPs and masterplans that occur in opaque consultations that take many of years to be published to sit as a .pdf on a local government website. Unlike our living cities, these are not living planning documents. Plans need to be working documents that are iterated constantly to take into consideration the changing facts on the ground, changes to population and demographic needs and fluid enough to act as a platform to stimulate growth, community cohesion and social entrepreneurship. Plans must be iterative and place-based, connecting into strategies around health and social care, social services and mobility. But they aren’t, and innovation is held back by resistance to change within the bureaucracy.</p><p name="7251" id="7251" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“By now, these orthodox ideas are part of our folklore. They harm us because we take them for granted.”</em></p><p name="a9de" id="a9de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the half century since Jacob’s wrote these words, the pace of technological change is providing new tools and data on which to inform planning decisions. Technology should be employed as much as possible to map resources and community assets and to sustain constant dialogue among stakeholders around what functions, institutions and spaces in a locality or working, and where they need revision or strengthening to perform better for citizens. (Public procurement in technology is moving society closer to repeating this, by setting up a whole new set of rules, regulation and orthodoxy around ICT and digital infrastructure — as seen in cumbersome and inflexible procurement contracts and partnerships between the public and private sector. Many of this procurement happens in the context where large blue-chip technology companies are trying to generate revenue in the face of increasingly redundant business models. More of this to come in subsequent blogs.)</p><p name="1a82" id="1a82" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Renewal planning, which is largely aimed at saving buildings…. Strewing the rest of a locality’s population… So does too heavily concentrate private building, capitalising on a rush on the high values created by a stable city neighbourhood.”</em></p><p name="da4b" id="da4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to Jacobs, renewal, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“…evades the meat of the question, which is the problem of what city neighbourhoods do, if anything, that may be socially and economically useful in cities themselves, and how they do it”</em>. Yet, gentrification is worn as a badge of honour by many city officials, keen to take glory from communities for their resilience and vitality. In Sao Paulo, Brazil a city which is often my home and which is undergoing lots of change to its modernist centre, is an eternal battleground against the darker forces of gentrification. Several grass-roots movements are fighting to save community assets such as open and green spaces, public realm and infrastructure as well as unique local patrimony as land values increase in renewal areas. Like in London, creative hubs, landmarks and community lobbies are been sacrificed. This for the order and progress of the North-American style condominium towers that replace the modernist family blocks and carpets over turn of the century urban villages. Often swept away are the true seeds that catalyse sustainable regeneration — unique and creative communities, local and family business, and most of all diversity. This is being repeated all over Brazil (and the world) in particular in beachfront cities where rampant speculation has displaced local populations in favour of holiday homes and time shares.In one neighbourhood in central Sao Paulo, residents painted over a new cycle lane with black paint. They preferred on street parking for themselves rather than a public amenity for the city.This particular phenomena is reflected in the recent and critically acclaimed Brazilian film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5221584/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5221584/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aquarius</a>, with Sonia Braga taking the baton of a brasileira Jane Jacobs.</p><p name="5ae0" id="5ae0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ever mindful of the stark and ever growing inequality that exists in our society, planning needs to focus away from the market, from land value to social value. We need to bolster and unlock the tacit knowledge and capacity of our citizens though plans and frameworks that stimulate local innovation in the supply chain. We need to have open and holistic planning conversations that bring together diverse sets of stakeholders, facilitated but not dictated by local and regional authorities. Most of all, planning in the 21st century needs to be something that is agile and continuously changing reflecting the dynamic nature of our lives and the cities in which we inhabit. The Guardian series invited readers to share their experience of Gentrification around the world. Voices from as far away as Mexico city explained how, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“displacement of poor people out of gentrified neighbourhoods is a serious issue here: people have to move to housing projects that are located 50km away from the city centre.”</em> But land developers are not to blame, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“They respond to the free trade economy. Their effects expose the irresponsibility of the state in providing affordable housing to those in need”</em>, explains Lorenzo Rocha.</p><p name="513a" id="513a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">London</a>, homes are “constantly under threat as the council tries to find ways to evict or move you out of the area to free up properties to sell, creating anxiety and vulnerability”</p><p name="a2d0" id="a2d0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“What gets forgotten is that we have a diverse community of people in my block who know each other and help each other out. It has created a class and race divide that didn&#39;t exist here before… Gentrification is about one demographic of our society changing an area for themselves and not for the benefit of everyone”.</em></p><p name="2283" id="2283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is hard to believe that almost sixty years ago, Jacobs was referring to the lack of engagement in renewal policy in Chicago around new projects and neighbourhoods. Today, the issues show no sign of abating with one respondent to the Guardian series noting, “gentrification is one of the most contentious issues facing our city”. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Building a new Chicago’; what does that mean?”</em>, asks Lynda Lopez, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“There is already a Chicago here”</em>.</p><p name="3bf5" id="3bf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In her book, Jacob’s quotes the great Eliel Saarinen, understanding that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘there must always be an end in view, and the end must not be final’.</em> Developing planning mechanisms, that are agile and flexible enough to be iterated and developed in a continuous process, not working to produce ‘final’ plans that are disingenuously revised every few years. Like a living city, the planning process is never complete. “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Street neighbourhoods have no beginnings and ends”</em> and “each street… is its own problem, and probably needs its own solution”. Many of Jane’s ideas are influenced by her understanding of ecology and natural systems, later in this series I will look at what these concepts mean for us today, and how they could shape a new understanding of planning.</p><p name="a1cf" id="a1cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“The one and only object of planning, is to provide the kind of environment in which we can all lead the most useful, convenient and the happiest lives.

Upward mobility for communities usually involves an established formula of low rents attracting creatives, which in turn brings in hipster young professionals and liberal young families that empower existing residents and allow neighbourhoods to thrive. Once this happens, place becomes increasingly entangled with market forces that pitch community against prosperity in a race to the bottom. Nowhere does gentrification stimulate speculation as much as London, a city struggling to deal with a steady exodus of young creatives and professionals priced out of the housing and rental markets. Regeneration of this kind, where thriving low income communities are displaced from an area to attract more desirable higher-earners who contribute to a positive rebranding of place is nothing new.

I remember I stayed in a hostel in ‘cool’ Camden while I traipsed the streets with my AtoZ through repetition of Victorian terraces unified by the hum of the dull grey-white horizon. I remember going to see the first house I would eventually live in. There was an older Irish lady weeping as the bus brought me down Holloway Road to Essex Road. North London had been home to the Irish for generations, but many of these had now moved out to Luton and Hertfordshire. Some weren’t as lucky as I would find out some years later. Hip Canonbury was at the more bohemian end of Angel, epicentre of the Cool Britannia set, yet far enough away from the rough edges of the city and grimey Shoreditch. The house I occupied was a pastiche addition at the end of a Georgian terrace built from architectural salvage by an eccentric West of Ireland familyman. I lived there for a year before Islington Council informed us that my ex-utility-room bedroom wasn’t fit for human inhabitation. Rents and land value in the area was also rising considerably.

The transience and dynamism of London neighbourhoods is often celebrated for its innovation and creativity, but when these pioneer communities are displaced, all that remains is sameness. Church St. Stoke Newington is no different now to a similar high St. in Putney or Balham. Murder Mile which was the affectionate colloquial name for my endz in Clapton Pond, could probably now be called Peppa Pig Pulled Pork Pond.

That is, that the planning system is broken, that it does not serve the people and citizens like it is supposed to. As mentioned in my first post, behaviour that occurs within the planning systems — among civil servants, built environment professions and developers — has served to sever any social contract between the architect or planner or citizen. The current system — built around compliance, risk and box-ticking — does little in the way of real engagement with citizens and the eventual users of cities. Yet it is by deep engagement with those who live and experience and area, in order to draw out insights n which to base plans, and strategies that take existing local assets, resources and their potential into consideration.

Where it’s at, quickly becomes where it shat and the cycle of gentrification sets off in another part of town, where the local migrants are more exotic, and the warehouses have not yet become pentecostal churches. Gentrification is what we call positive (mostly organic examples) of urban renewal. Places that seem to linger in a suspended animation of stagnation, often sink deeper into decline are not considered to have gentrified. Jacob’s draws attention to the role of local government in renewal and regeneration, and how the system seems not to learn from mistakes, but keeps churning out replacement development without ever addressing the root causes of deprivation.

This needs to change”. Planning professionals — complicated by the local authority planning systems, consultation process round LAPs and masterplans that occur in opaque consultations that take many of years to be published to sit as a .pdf on a local government website. Unlike our living cities, these are not living planning documents. Plans need to be working documents that are iterated constantly to take into consideration the changing facts on the ground, changes to population and demographic needs and fluid enough to act as a platform to stimulate growth, community cohesion and social entrepreneurship. Plans must be iterative and place-based, connecting into strategies around health and social care, social services and mobility.

(Public procurement in technology is moving society closer to repeating this, by setting up a whole new set of rules, regulation and orthodoxy around ICT and digital infrastructure — as seen in cumbersome and inflexible procurement contracts and partnerships between the public and private sector.

Yet, gentrification is worn as a badge of honour by many city officials, keen to take glory from communities for their resilience and vitality. In Sao Paulo, Brazil a city which is often my home and which is undergoing lots of change to its modernist centre, is an eternal battleground against the darker forces of gentrification. Several grass-roots movements are fighting to save community assets such as open and green spaces, public realm and infrastructure as well as unique local patrimony as land values increase in renewal areas. Like in London, creative hubs, landmarks and community lobbies are been sacrificed. This for the order and progress of the North-American style condominium towers that replace the modernist family blocks and carpets over turn of the century urban villages. Often swept away are the true seeds that catalyse sustainable regeneration — unique and creative communities, local and family business, and most of all diversity. This is being repeated all over Brazil (and the world) in particular in beachfront cities where rampant speculation has displaced local populations in favour of holiday homes and time shares.In one neighbourhood in central Sao Paulo, residents painted over a new cycle lane with black paint. They preferred on street parking for themselves rather than a public amenity for the city.This particular phenomena is reflected in the recent and critically acclaimed Brazilian film Aquarius, with Sonia Braga taking the baton of a brasileira Jane Jacobs.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":1653,"end":1661,"href":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5221584/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":30,"end":217}]},{"name":"5ae0","type":1,"text":"Ever mindful of the stark and ever growing inequality that exists in our society, planning needs to focus away from the market, from land value to social value.

Most of all, planning in the 21st century needs to be something that is agile and continuously changing reflecting the dynamic nature of our lives and the cities in which we inhabit. The Guardian series invited readers to share their experience of Gentrification around the world. Voices from as far away as Mexico city explained how, “displacement of poor people out of gentrified neighbourhoods is a serious issue here: people have to move to housing projects that are located 50km away from the city centre.” But land developers are not to blame, “They respond to the free trade economy. Their effects expose the irresponsibility of the state in providing affordable housing to those in need”, explains Lorenzo Rocha.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":827,"end":1003},{"type":2,"start":1042,"end":1187}]},{"name":"513a","type":1,"text":"In London, homes are “constantly under threat as the council tries to find ways to evict or move you out of the area to free up properties to sell, creating anxiety and vulnerability”","markups":[{"type":3,"start":3,"end":9,"href":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"a2d0","type":1,"text":"“What gets forgotten is that we have a diverse community of people in my block who know each other and help each other out.

Like a living city, the planning process is never complete. “Street neighbourhoods have no beginnings and ends” and “each street… is its own problem, and probably needs its own solution”.
