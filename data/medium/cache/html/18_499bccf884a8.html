While I pondered what that would be, I decided to do a short story about the money Trump had raised for veterans.</p><p name="0af9" id="0af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted to chase down two suspicions I’d brought home with me from that event in Iowa.

I started calling experts.</p><p name="b58d" id="b58d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I think it’s pretty clear that that’s over the line,” Marc S. Owens, the former longtime head of the Internal Revenue Service’s nonprofit division, told me when I called him.</p><p name="0a52" id="0a52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then Owens kept talking, and the story started deflating.</p><p name="3d0f" id="3d0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In theory, Owens said, nonprofit groups like the Trump Foundation are “absolutely prohibited” from participating or intervening in a political campaign. But, he said, if the IRS did investigate, it wouldn’t likely start until the Trump Foundation filed its paperwork for 2016. Which wouldn’t be until late 2017. Then an agent would open a case. There went 2018. Finally, Owens said, the IRS might take action: It might even take away the Trump Foundation’s tax-exempt status.</p><p name="ba58" id="ba58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2019. Or maybe not ever.</p><p name="8a19" id="8a19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Owens doubted that the IRS — already under scrutiny from the GOP-run Congress after allegations it had given undue scrutiny to conservative groups — would ever pick a fight with Trump.</p><p name="11e7" id="11e7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I don’t think anything’s going to happen” to Trump, Owens said. “But, theoretically, it could.”</p><p name="5fc5" id="5fc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My other suspicion was that Trump was still sitting on the bulk of the money he had raised for veterans — including the $1 million he had promised from himself.</p><blockquote name="c0ab" id="c0ab" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">I asked Trump’s people to account for all this money.

He wouldn’t say which groups Trump had donated to. Or when. Or in what amounts.</p><p name="ad10" id="ad10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was an important assertion — that Trump had delivered on a signature campaign promise — made without proof. I didn’t want to just take Lewandowksi’s word for it.</p><p name="1538" id="1538" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I tried to prove him right.</p><p name="5f6f" id="5f6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spent a day searching for Trump’s money on Twitter, asking vets’ organizations if they’d gotten any of it. I used Trump’s Twitter handle, @realdonaldtrump, because I wanted Trump to see me searching.</p><p name="c0ed" id="c0ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump saw.</p><p name="ce17" id="ce17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next night, he called me to say he had just then given away the $1 million, all in one swoop, to a nonprofit run by a friend.

Where was the remainder of the money Trump had raised from other donors, four months earlier? Turns out, it had been sitting in the Trump Foundation, unspent. In this news conference, Trump announced that he had given the last of it away — and he lashed out at the media for asking him to account for the money.</p><p name="4e4f" id="4e4f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Instead of being like, ‘Thank you very much, Mr. Trump,’ or ‘Trump did a good job,’ everyone said : ‘Who got it?

The New York Times and Le Monde referenced my work. My dad wrote to say how proud he was of me. I read pundits predicting that the presidential race itself would change. They said the old trope about Trump — that he was a Teflon candidate, immune to accountability — was now disproved.</p><p name="16b4" id="16b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I came home from my last TV hit, the kids, ages 4 and 5 months, were asleep.

The next day, with some of my dignity permanently lost, I got started on a bigger story.</p><p name="861b" id="861b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea for this story had come from our executive editor, Marty Baron. One night, as we both waited for an elevator, Marty offered a suggestion.</p><p name="ffff" id="ffff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why don’t you go beyond Trump’s promises to give to veterans, he said, and look at Trump’s giving to charity, period?</p><p name="18dc" id="18dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The logic was that Trump had just tried to wiggle out of a charitable promise he’d made on national TV. What, Marty wondered, had he been doing before the campaign, when nobody was looking?</p><p name="c8cb" id="c8cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That reporting process started with a lot of paper.</p><p name="c0e5" id="c0e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Working with one of The Post’s ace researchers, Alice Crites, I went digging for records that would reveal Trump’s charitable giving, going back to his early days as a Manhattan developer in the 1980s. We looked at old news clippings, detailing Trump’s public statements. And we looked at tax filings from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which had been dug out of storage by New York state.</p><p name="c1d8" id="c1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those two sources told two very different stories.</p><p name="59d0" id="59d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the news clippings, you could see that Trump had repeatedly made public promises to donate to charity. In the 1980s, for instance, Trump had promised to give away $4 million from sales of his book “The Art of the Deal.” In more recent years, he said he would give away $2.5 million he made off “The Apprentice.” And donated the profits from Trump University. All told, the pledges in those news clips made it seem that Trump had given away more than $12 million.</p><p name="fb2e" id="fb2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In more recent clippings, in fact, Trump’s presidential campaign staff said his actual giving had been far higher than that: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/12/trumps-campaign-says-hes-given-tens-of-millions-to-charity-but-offers-no-details-and-no-proof/?tid=sm_medium" data-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/12/trumps-campaign-says-hes-given-tens-of-millions-to-charity-but-offers-no-details-and-no-proof/?tid=sm_medium" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tens of millions </a>” over his lifetime.</p><p name="d8ee" id="d8ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The state’s records showed something else.</p><p name="2036" id="2036" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They showed that the Trump Foundation — which Trump had set up to give away his own money — had received only a total of $5.5 million from Trump since 1987.</p><p name="0a9f" id="0a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So where was all that other money that he said he had been donating?</p><p name="28d0" id="28d0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We want to keep them private.

The barbecue columnist for Texas Monthly — an idol to me, as a journalist and a native Texan — was watching videos of other people’s parties taken at a Trump golf resort.

Trump and Bush were wearing hot microphones.</p><p name="2f40" id="2f40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the bus, Trump told Bush about trying and failing to seduce a woman in Palm Beach.

But those had been excused, by some, because they were just words. Trump, it seemed, was playing an outrageous version of himself in public, for the entertainment of Stern and his audience.</p><p name="6da8" id="6da8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this video was different.

The story was easy to compose, since much of it was simply repeating what Trump had said. The only problem was the bad words.</p><p name="1331" id="1331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Post is a fairly fusty place when it comes to profanity. If a reporter tries to get a bad word into a story, the word is usually forwarded to top editors, who consider it with the gravity and speed that the Vatican applies to candidates for sainthood. That unwieldy system assumed that bad words would attack one at a time, like bad guys in a kung-fu movie.</p><p name="ff77" id="ff77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But in this story, we were dealing with a whole army of bad words at once. The system was overloaded. When Trump said, “Grab ’em by the p — — ,” for instance, the editors weren’t sure people would be able to guess right away what “p — — ” was. They added a letter at the end: “p — -y.”</p><p name="03c2" id="03c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other words required a ruling from the bosses.</p><p name="3fb1" id="3fb1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Go find out about ‘tits’!” I heard one editor tell another, while the story was being edited — Trump had used the word in criticizing a woman’s appearance. The second editor left to find a higher-ranking editor who could make a ruling. “ ‘Tits’ is all right,” he said when he returned.</p><p name="3697" id="3697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, 3:30 p.m. was getting closer.</p><p name="3ffc" id="3ffc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We didn’t get any on-the-record response from NBC, Bush or Zucker.</p><p name="3b1c" id="3b1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then we heard from Trump’s spokeswoman.</p><p name="c65c" id="c65c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’d read the transcript. She said: That doesn’t sound like Mr. Trump. She wanted to see the video. We sent it to them at 3:50 p.m., with a warning that we would publish the story soon — with or without their comment.</p><p name="c294" id="c294" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then nothing. Our lawyers and editors were satisfied that the tape was legitimate and newsworthy. The story was edited and ready to go. 4 p.m. arrived. Terri Rupar, the national digital editor, was walking to her desk to hit the button and publish it without comment from Trump.</p><p name="39d5" id="39d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I yelled for Terri to stop.</p><p name="7e92" id="7e92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump was admitting it.</p><p name="3f92" id="3f92" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.
