class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6cc9" id="6cc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A scenario frequently illustrated in cartoons, memes, and in real life begins with woman who shares an idea in a group meeting. The woman, after being summarily ignored, watches as a man repeats her idea, to great surprise and praise.</p><p name="ce7b" id="ce7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to take a moment to insist that everyone reading this, right now, accept that this is truly and actually something that happens with great regularity in conference rooms in most companies in America. It’s not a fairy tale crafted to reveal a surprise moral at the very end. It’s real. It’s happened to me, and probably in some form to every woman that everyone reading this has ever known.</p><p name="edc4" id="edc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bringing up that group meeting scenario is not meant to fault or criticize the men reading this. In fact, while I anticipate that it may happen anyways, I want to emphasize that imparting guilt is not at all a goal of this essay. The goals are to inspire, to rally, and to remind everyone reading of a few important things:</p><p name="1b22" id="1b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, that “women’s issues” is a false label. These are human issues;</p><p name="d0f5" id="d0f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, that the overwhelmingly male executive branch of our government is currently waging a war on women;</p><p name="7f19" id="7f19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lastly, that the resistance to Tr*mp’s white-dude coalition needs male ally-warriors for the counter-attack.</p><p name="41ac" id="41ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So: I bring up the group meeting scenario not to bash the person who repeated our smart lady’s good idea and got credit for it; most of us would do that on the reg if we could get away with it. I mention it to highlight the fact that, in nearly all spaces where human beings exist and interact, men are regarded as more competent, intelligent, authoritative, and powerful than women. There are exceptions, and there are also physical features that code some men as less powerful than others — but the fact remains.</p><p name="3a53" id="3a53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The staying power of that group meeting scenario-meme is rooted in its accurate representation of reality.</p><p name="123e" id="123e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember a riddle from when I was in elementary school: “A doctor is performing surgery on a young boy. The boy is the doctor’s son, but the doctor is not the boy’s father. How is this possible?”</p><p name="e511" id="e511" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe, at this point in our wokeness, the riddle seems silly and obvious. But just think for a few moments about young children being utterly stumped by that question. That the image of authority and accomplishment has a male face is still baked into our society as deeply as any other prejudice.</p><p name="4599" id="4599" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All that to say: men, we need you to help us resist Tr*mp.</p><p name="8b8a" id="8b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We know that you love us, support us, and want the best for us. But in this moment, when all three branches of government are firmly in conservative Republicans’ control, we need male friends, family members, and coworkers to stand with us — not in a metaphorical, unspoken support kind of way, but out loud, consistently, and unapologetically.</p><p name="cf0d" id="cf0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it feels exasperating to debate constantly about women’s reproductive rights, and abortion in particular, that’s because it is. We’d love to move on. But for women, the choice to move on from this fight without winning it is no choice at all.</p><figure name="8ef0" id="8ef0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 444px; max-height: 193px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 43.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*G0TR6QP9TkZffQ_X." data-width="444" data-height="193" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*G0TR6QP9TkZffQ_X."></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Real talk, shared with permission from Melissa</figcaption></figure><p name="cda1" id="cda1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The potential of the female body to become pregnant is an awe-inspiring gift to many; it is also the heaviest of burdens, starting as young as 9 or 10 years old. Rather than attempting to lighten the burden, conservative men in power have long twisted that awe-inspiring potential into evidence for essential differences between the sexes, evidence that rationalizes those men’s positions of power and relegates women to being their “complements”: the homemakers to their breadwinners, quiet and soft when they are aggressive and hard, pliable and willing whenever they are aroused and ready for action.</p><p name="75d2" id="75d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regressive, older, white, male Republicans might be a dying breed, but they’re very much alive and in charge right now. Just weeks ago, in the year 2017, an Oklahoma state congressman introduced a bill that would require women seeking abortion to receive written permission from their male partner. His logic?<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> “I understand that they feel like that is their body,” he said of women… “But after you’re irresponsible, then don’t claim, well, I can just go and do this with another body, when you’re the host and you invited that in.” </em>(<a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/13/oklahoma-lawmakers-want-men-to-approve-all-abortions/" data-href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/13/oklahoma-lawmakers-want-men-to-approve-all-abortions/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>)</p><p name="43db" id="43db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That state congressman suffers from a delusion that’s currently in outbreak status in Republican circles: an utter distrust of women. Among male elected officials, this distrust often coexists with a shocking ignorance of the way sex, rape, pregnancy, and abortions work. For just one example among many, consider the US congressman from Missouri, who stated publicly that he doesn’t believe in abortion rights for rape victims, because<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”</em> (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/19/todd-akin-abortion-legitimate-rape_n_1807381.html" data-href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/19/todd-akin-abortion-legitimate-rape_n_1807381.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HuffPo</a>).</p><figure name="6e93" id="6e93" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 569px; max-height: 328px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 57.599999999999994%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*brm6bCW9J8CpcfK1QMXwxA.png" data-width="569" data-height="328" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*brm6bCW9J8CpcfK1QMXwxA.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">You can watch the video via the HuffPo link above, if you’d like to feel dead inside</figcaption></figure><p name="6192" id="6192" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Observe how distrust of women (“legitimate” rape, as compared with…?) combines with willful ignorance about the female body (can someone point me towards the “shut it down” button?) in this man’s mind. The mind that he uses to write laws that directly harm women’s chances to pursue the lives they want, which just might include enjoying sex without wanting children.</p><p name="f885" id="f885" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Inequality between men and women is insidious and harmful to society. And the key to fighting inequality is securing for women full, unqualified control over their bodies through comprehensive reproductive rights. Because the way many Republicans currently in office would have it is for women to have a simple choice: either abstain from sex or put your health, your ambitions, and your plans on the line, because if you get pregnant, tough luck. And that’s not a choice at all.</p><p name="da93" id="da93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, men whom we love and admire, will you help us, loudly and unapologetically, to resist losing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">any </em>ground in the fight for equal opportunity?</p><p name="8215" id="8215" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I make this request, I want to provide some personal context. And to first set the stage: according to recent data from Daily Action, women have made around 86 percent of calls to members of Congress since Tr*mp’s election (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-activism-surge-donald-trump-took-office_us_58dd8950e4b0e6ac7093b3c1" data-href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-activism-surge-donald-trump-took-office_us_58dd8950e4b0e6ac7093b3c1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">source</a>).</p><p name="58b7" id="58b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few days ago as I read those numbers, confirming just how much of the weight women are carrying in actively resisting Tr*mp administration cruelties, a new goal bloomed in my mind. I want to take this opportunity not to look backwards or chastise or lament, but to look ahead. To embrace and realize the incredible opportunity we have in this moment of political engagement to move the needle on gender equality — by activating male partners, friends, and family into the fight.</p><figure name="1cdb" id="1cdb" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 487px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 92.80000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0Aul2XMXxIsLs56J9M5LRw.jpeg" data-width="957" data-height="888" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*0Aul2XMXxIsLs56J9M5LRw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*0Aul2XMXxIsLs56J9M5LRw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Women’s March in New Orleans, January 2017, with my #1 man.</figcaption></figure><p name="6568" id="6568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In preparation for writing this, I decided to informally (non-scientifically) poll my friends. Among the women who responded, about 48% make at least one call to Congress per week. 10% of the women make 4 or more weekly calls. Within my male circle, the number who make at least one call per week is 11%. None indicated that he makes 4 or more.</p><p name="ed7d" id="ed7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know that men close to me who are reading this have taken and will continue to take action in support of women in their lives, including me. I know you care. But in this moment, we need more. We are feeling the unbalanced effort. A large majority of men whom I surveyed rated their political engagement since the election at 3 out of 5 or higher (84%). Less than half of women surveyed agreed with them. The other 58% rated “the political engagement of men in your circle” at 1 or 2 out of 5.</p><p name="c920" id="c920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be clear: this surveying effort was neither scientific nor broad in scope. But that’s part of what makes it interesting to me: within the group of young, liberal people that I surround myself with, does political engagement break along gender lines?<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>How are my female friends feeling about male participation in resistance to the GOP’s aggressive war on women?</p><blockquote name="69de" id="69de" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They don’t think birth control applies to them; women’s rights aren’t men’s rights; their rights aren’t the ones at stake.”</blockquote><p name="60c6" id="60c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">To me, the numbers from Daily Action cited above and the tiny sliver of data I gathered highlight the incredible opportunity I mentioned earlier for moving the needle towards greater gender equality. If the percentage of men and women taking political action can shift closer to 50/50, I believe that changes will come.</p><p name="fcc1" id="fcc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every man reading this carries with him a unique frame of reference, so I cringe at generalizing; however, in my survey I asked women to share what they think might be holding men they know back from being more active. A common thread emerged. “I think they think it’s just for the women (ex: they don’t think birth control applies to them, women’s rights aren’t men’s rights, their rights aren’t the ones at stake),” one respondent wrote.</p><p name="0eed" id="0eed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Men in my circle “don’t feel an immediate threat to their safety or quality of life,” said another. The reason that my male circle has been less engaged than women to this point, a third said, is “privilege.”</p><p name="7eb9" id="7eb9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Privilege” is a loaded word these days, and one that can chafe, but I hope that these observations offer some insight into how women are feeling. Privilege is, if nothing else, an apt expression to summarize the position of men in the present war on women. To be secure enough in your position in society not to personally recoil at sexist statements by our Vice President or experience a wave of fear upon running low on birth control is a privilege.</p><p name="ac64" id="ac64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we shift to talking about action, dealing with your privilege is the first step. I know from experience.</p><p name="c7b2" id="c7b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reckoning with my privilege as a white, straight, physically healthy person over the last several months has been deeply challenging (more on that at the end). It brings on feelings of guilt and discomfort, moments recalled that cannot be changed and words that cannot be taken back. But what happened for me during this exploration was a transformation in how I get my news, process information, and develop opinions, a transformation that spilled over into my perception of the past, the present, and the future. And, critically in this moment, that spurred my eagerness to influence the latter two.</p><p name="2848" id="2848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to encourage all men reading to consciously close the “distance” they’ve allowed to exist between themselves and the burdens placed on women. I want my male circle to recognize that among their friends, mothers, wives, sisters, girlfriends, cousins, and coworkers, there are women who have been raped and assaulted, women who depend on Planned Parenthood and the ACA, women who experience unending condescension at work, and women who experience profound anxiety and fear due to words and actions from the leaders of our government.</p><blockquote name="e4bd" id="e4bd" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The terrifying, honest fact is that I have to weigh pursuing my passions against my ability to live a healthy life.”</blockquote><p name="e024" id="e024" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--pullquote">“I don’t think men in my family are generally aware of how different women’s healthcare needs are than theirs,” wrote one female friend. “The terrifying, honest fact is that I have to weigh pursuing my passions against my ability to live a healthy life,” said another woman, whose desire to pursue entrepreneurship has been dampened by the threat of rollbacks on health care and reproductive rights.</p><p name="b0b4" id="b0b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is understandable that for many of these issues there is unequal awareness between men and women. But, once learned, I hope that the facts become impossible to ignore. Consider “gender ratings,” which have long allowed insurance companies to charge women more than men, even with all other factors being equal. The ACA banned gender ratings, in a major recognition of barriers women face in seeking quality care at a decent price. The Tr*mp replacement would lift the ACA’s ban.</p><blockquote name="6bf3" id="6bf3" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The silence of many men in our culture adds to the stigma of an already stressful decision.”</blockquote><p name="9396" id="9396" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Statistically, each of us knows multiple women who have experienced sexual assault or rape (1 in 3 women overall). We likely know someone who has had an abortion (occurs in about 19% of pregnancies in the US). Statistics can feel cold and distant—until they’re not.</p><p name="6cec" id="6cec" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have had sexual experiences with men that have bordered on assaultive behavior,” wrote a friend in my survey. And another: “Having an abortion was a choice I made with the benefit of my privilege and the support of my partner. But for women who aren’t in that position, the silence of many men in our culture adds to the stigma of an already stressful decision.”</p><p name="a334" id="a334" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All that to say: men, the women whom you know well, personally, and intimately need you. Remember the meeting room scenario and the doctor/son riddle; men’s voices carry weight, particularly among other men (aka most of our Congress).</p><p name="e927" id="e927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To speak out in support of abortion access or against rape culture is no walk in the park, but doing so one-on-one with a friend or in a voicemail to your Members of Congress <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">will </em>make a difference. Maybe you’re doing this regularly already. By all means, tell your female friends when you take action. Our spirits will lift.</p><p name="6b73" id="6b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thank you so much for reading.</p></div></div></section><section name="f685" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="102e" id="102e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">P.S.
