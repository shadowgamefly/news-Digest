Chicago was getting ready to host the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, and it wanted to look sharp for all those millions of people who’d be coming to visit the bustling Midwest metropolis.</p><p name="f70a" id="f70a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1892, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Chicago Tribune </em>offered a one-hundred-dollar prize for the best suggestion of a municipal color or combination of colors that would symbolize the city.

If you remember the decoration at the time of the death of President Lincoln, where the people only used black and white, you will recall how striking, impressive, and artistic was the general effect. Now, in general terms, the facade of a building is best decorated with one color alone or with two or three colors properly arranged without any special regard to the employment of red, white, and blue. … Almost all European cities have chosen colors, as the universities and colleges have done, and these are called the “municipal colors.”</blockquote><p name="2373" id="2373" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And the <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1892/09/11/page/1/article/colors-for-chicago" data-href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1892/09/11/page/1/article/colors-for-chicago" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tribune</em> suggested that a municipal color scheme would boost Chicagoans’ sense of solidarity</a>:</p><blockquote name="4a08" id="4a08" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Chicago’s unparalleled progress has been in no small degree due to the intense local pride and loyalty of its citizens of all classes. “Shoulder to shoulder, close ranks” has always been the watchword, and the consequence is a vast amount of justifiable civic pride which would doubtless welcome a chance to display itself in the display of a “municipal color.”</blockquote><p name="4b84" id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Shoulder to shoulder?</em> Describing Chicagoans as a unified bunch was wishful thinking.

Back in 1909, he’d introduced the “novelty” of showing motion pictures during a campaign event at a “nickel house.” Now, he said:</p><blockquote name="4e7a" id="4e7a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In order to symbolize Chicago civic properly, to stimulate local patriotism, visualize industrial progress, and instill in school children a concrete evidence of the reality of the city of Chicago as a corporate community and civic organization, it is advisable to adopt a suitable design for a municipal flag.</blockquote><p name="84fa" id="84fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofcit78chic" data-href="https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofcit78chic" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">In July 1915, the City Council approved Kearns’s motion</a> to form a Municipal Flag Commission.

A municipal flag will arouse civic pride and allegiance to home industry and form a rallying point for the plans and deeds which make for better conditions and better citizens. A municipal flag instills a sense of duty towards the community and city into the hearts of citizens and children, engendering that spirit of progress which serves to make a city or a community great.

The space or area to be utilized is so limited by its terms and the conditions so insistent, that there is neither room nor reason for colors and designs which do not make for a Chicago flag.</blockquote><blockquote name="4f9c" id="4f9c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 2.</strong> Since the municipal flag of the City of Chicago is always to be flown in conjunction with the Stars and Stripes, all designs for a municipal flag submitted by competitors should be colored and patterned with special reference to such continued and inevitable use.</blockquote><blockquote name="e784" id="e784" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 3.</strong> The municipal flag should not only be symbolic of the City of Chicago, but also typify its ideals and aspirations, its history, its geographical and political divisions, and its people, so far as possible; but it should display knowledge of heraldric and other symbols already assigned definite meanings.</blockquote><blockquote name="8472" id="8472" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 4. </strong>The municipal flag should be beautiful, to the point of decorativeness. The colors should contrast effectively and the divisions of the design accord symmetrically.</blockquote><blockquote name="1f4d" id="1f4d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 5. </strong>The municipal flag should be simple. Elaboration at any point, whether by multiplicity of colors or minute subdivisions of design, will destroy its chief purposes.</blockquote><blockquote name="618a" id="618a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 6. </strong>The municipal flag should be the symbol and emblem of a free people in a free city and for this reason devices peculiar to the Old World and other foreign countries should be omitted from the design of the municipal flag for the City of Chicago.</blockquote><blockquote name="a086" id="a086" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 7. </strong>The municipal flag should be original. It should not resemble closely in coloration or design any other flag whatsoever.</blockquote><blockquote name="7727" id="7727" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 8. </strong>The municipal flag should be contrived and designed with prime reference to the fundamental fact that it is to be made from fabrics, cotton, bunting, silk or other material which can be readily cut and stitched.</blockquote><blockquote name="c312" id="c312" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 9. </strong>The symbols and details on the municipal flag should be such as will work out particularly by cutting and stitching fabrics. Nothing that requires to be painted on, as landscapes, unconventionalized birds and beasts or natural objects in general, should find place, demanding as they frequently do, separate treatment for the two sides of the flag. No lettering, either of initials, words, mottoes or figures, will be permitted or considered on a municipal flag design. The municipal flag should be alike on both sides for the sake of simplicity and for ease of manufacture.</blockquote><blockquote name="ab16" id="ab16" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 10. </strong>The municipal flag should conform in its sizes, shapes and proportions to those which custom and experience have established as suitable.</blockquote><blockquote name="bb04" id="bb04" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Rule 11. </strong>The use of the colors and designs of the municipal flag as a banner to be hung vertically rather than flown horizontally, and as a badge, button or other device to be worn on the person may well be taken into consideration, and its colors and design be made adaptable to such ends when practicable.</blockquote><p name="f56c" id="f56c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Rice also offered a list of “suggestions,” including one that addressed the tricky issue of how a flag looks as it is rippling in the wind:</p><blockquote name="4d02" id="4d02" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The municipal flag should be designed with some practical knowledge derived from observation of the proportions of flags flown to the breeze, and of the portions or parts of such flag coming first into view and also oftenest in view. For this purpose it is desirable that certain elementary facts should be considered, as [1] the lower corner next the staff is the first to show when the flag lifts itself from pendency; [2] the line of flag next the staff is visible before its middle third is disclosed; [3] the whole of the first third of the flag is in view before the last third, the fly, is seen; [4] the upper of the fly is not seen until the rest of the flag is streaming. It is evident from such study and observation of the properties of flags that horizontal divisions, bars and stripes, flow and stream with the stream and flow of the flag and that vertical divisions, cantons, quarters and piles act against and interrupt these. The former, therefore, make for beauty, distinctiveness and visibility; the latter against them.</blockquote><p name="0488" id="0488" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Considering that Rice wrote the rules, it isn’t surprising that he won.</p><p name="3fe6" id="3fe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More than a thousand entries poured in. “Many of them looked pretty well on paper, where every part of the pattern is seen equally well, but would not have shown to any advantage dancing in a variable breeze, which is the only test of a flag,” the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tribune</em> later reported.</p><p name="d295" id="d295" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One proposal used that “Y” shape symbolizing the branches of the Chicago River.

He displayed it at his Pierce-Arrow showroom at 2420 South Michigan Avenue, in an area known as Motor Row.</p><p name="600a" id="600a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On May 30, Rice went along with Mayor William Hale Thompson and a delegation of city officials to the downstate town of Evansville, where the mayor dedicated a monument to the late <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410050.html" data-href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410050.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">James Thompson, who’d been Chicago’s first land surveyor back in 1830</a>. (The mayor, nicknamed Big Bill, wasn’t related to the surveyor.)</p><p name="e89a" id="e89a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This ceremony was the first time Chicago’s municipal flag was ever displayed outside of the city. Rice later recalled telling the mayor about the significance of those six-pointed stars, explaining it “in detail.”</p><p name="e13a" id="e13a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mayor Thompson, who hadn’t taken an active role in the flag’s selection process, “openly expressed” his “enthusiastic approval,” according to Rice.</p><h3 name="6d47" id="6d47" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What the flag means</h3><p name="19b9" id="19b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Recent documents from the Chicago City Clerk’s office offer a simple explanation of the flag’s symbols. Those two blue bars represent the branches of the Chicago River. And from top to bottom, the white stripes stand for the North Side, the West Side and the South Side.</p><h3 name="6839" id="6839" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The blue stripes</h3><p name="77db" id="77db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But Rice’s original ideas about those stripes were more complicated. He noted that blue was “the color of the Lake and River, of distant mountains, and of the Oceans.” The flag’s top blue stripe stood for the Chicago River’s North Branch, but Rice said it also had a “national” meaning — the Allegheny Mountains. And it had a “terrestrial” meaning, symbolizing the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. But Rice wasn’t consistent about all of this. Another time, he said the top blue stripe stood for Lake Michigan and the river’s North Branch.</p><p name="6011" id="6011" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bottom blue stripe was a symbol of the Chicago River’s South Branch, but for Rice, it had similar layers of multiple meaning. From a national perspective, it signified the Rocky Mountains and the Sierras. And from a global viewpoint, it represented the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. On another occasion, Rice gave a different explanation for the bottom blue stripe, saying it stood for the river’s South Branch and “the great canal” — referring to the Illinois and Michigan Canal and/or the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.</p><h3 name="43d5" id="43d5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The white stripes</h3><p name="e798" id="e798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Rice did not think of the white stripes as a neutral background. “It is white, the composite of all the colors, because its population is a composite of all the nations, dwelling here in peace,” Rice said.</p><p name="7759" id="7759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The flag’s top white stripe “stands locally for the North Side, nationally for the Atlantic Coast, and terrestrially for the countries east and north of the United States,” Rice wrote.</p><p name="8d88" id="8d88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The middle white bar “stands locally for the West Side, nationally for the Great Central Plain dominated by Chicago, and terrestrially for the United States.”</p><p name="1597" id="1597" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the white bar across the flag’s bottom was “stands locally for the South Side, nationally for the Pacific Coast, and terrestrially for the countries west and south of the United States.”</p><p name="663b" id="663b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s no wonder that these ideas have been simplified over time.</p><p name="381b" id="381b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The middle white stripe is twice as wide as the other two — symbolizing the fact that the West Side was larger than the North Side and South Side were. Rice called it “the great West side, with an area and population greatly exceeding that of the other two sides.”</p><p name="5ec0" id="5ec0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That assertion might surprise today’s Chicagoans. The West Side, as most people think of it now, no longer dwarfs the city’s other sides. That’s because our concept of the city’s layout has evolved. During Chicago’s first century, people often referred to its three sides: the North Side, the West Side and the South Side. Sometimes, these were called the city’s “divisions.”</p><p name="197b" id="197b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That Y-shaped Chicago River, with its branches, was commonly accepted as the dividing line between these sections of the city. If you look at the city that way, the West Side is large indeed, encompassing everything west of the river’s branches.</p><figure name="b532" id="b532" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 1041px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 148.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DVtcDqO3te2cSWupPpgRgQ.jpeg" data-width="761" data-height="1132" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*DVtcDqO3te2cSWupPpgRgQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DVtcDqO3te2cSWupPpgRgQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">1880 map by the West Chicago Park Commissioners (<a href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f7549" data-href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f7549" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">image: Boston Public Library</a>)</figcaption></figure><p name="bfe7" id="bfe7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The construction of expressways after World War II created new dividing lines.

Why were there two stars? Because Chicago was the second-biggest city in the United States. And if you added the two blue stripes to the two red stars for a sum of four, that signified the idea that Chicago was “the fourth city of the globe.” (If Chicago actually was the world’s fourth-largest city at the time, it has fallen way down in those rankings since then.)</p><figure name="e0b3" id="e0b3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 901px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 128.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pYU9zcDtPOSeujBDCIOspQ.jpeg" data-width="920" data-height="1184" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*pYU9zcDtPOSeujBDCIOspQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pYU9zcDtPOSeujBDCIOspQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">A page from the October 2, 1921, Chicago Herald and Examiner, posted on <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/2012/05/chicagos-flag-more-than-stars-and-stripes-2/" data-href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/2012/05/chicagos-flag-more-than-stars-and-stripes-2/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Chicago Detours website</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="1037" id="1037" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The flag’s geometry</h3><p name="f7e5" id="f7e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Rice wrote out very specific instructions for the size of the stripes and the shape of the stars.</p><p name="b669" id="b669" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But when aldermen voted on the flag’s design, they kept things simple — and a little vague. For one thing, the ordinance doesn’t say anything about white stripes. Instead, it describes white as the flag’s background color: “The Chicago municipal flag shall be white, with two blue bars…” Then it declares that each of these blue bars is one-sixth of the flag’s width.</p><p name="6e5b" id="6e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The city’s law then offers some wiggle room about exactly where those blue stripes should go. They are supposed to be “set a little less than one-sixth of the way from the top and bottom of the flag, respectively.”</p><p name="3a81" id="3a81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A little less? How much less? The law doesn’t say.</p><p name="8203" id="8203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chicagoan Ted Whalen, who has researched the city flag’s history, suggests that the vague language may actually be what Rice intended. Rice’s suggestions in the flag-design contest included this advice:</p><blockquote name="fad4" id="fad4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The visibility at distances of the several colors and of the different portions of the flag itself should be taken into account in determining its proportions, rather than divisions of mathematical exactitude. In other words, it is the effect of symmetry, not the mere physical fact, which should be taken into account. The French, for example, after extensive experimentation, divide their tricolor so that the blue next the staff has thirty parts in a hundred, the white in the middle thirty-three parts, and the red in the fly thirty-seven, and thus secure the appearance of an equal division.</blockquote><p name="299e" id="299e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><a href="http://introvert.net/blog/2005/07/21/suggestion-7/" data-href="http://introvert.net/blog/2005/07/21/suggestion-7/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Whalen says</a>: “I suppose this explains why all the descriptions of the flag have tortured syntax — the ‘slightly less than a sixth’ language.

id="c5e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Over the decades, people have occasionally suggested adding a fifth star to the flag. One idea was a star representing the French explorers Joliet and Marquette. And then in 1961, a fifth star was suggested to represent Chicago’s role as the birthplace of the atomic age. (The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction took place December 2, 1942, at the University of Chicago.) “I think we’ll explore this,” Mayor Richard J. Daley said. But nothing came of it.</p><figure name="f8d5" id="f8d5" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 450px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 150%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dOaFWr-jeQ9mIsRF0CZijA.jpeg" data-width="300" data-height="450" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*dOaFWr-jeQ9mIsRF0CZijA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Richard J.

The resolution was replete with flowery language:</p><blockquote name="bd32" id="bd32" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">… Whereas, Now the citizens of Chicago are in agreement that there is a fifth significant event which should be commemorated, that is the twenty-one years of faithful service and leadership achieved by our beloved Mayor Richard J. Daley; and</blockquote><blockquote name="4676" id="4676" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Whereas, The City itself is a monument to Mayor Daley since its magnificent lakefront, its gleaming skyscrapers and its diverse neighborhoods are the result of his enthusiasm for and love of his City; a love that was contagious and was infused into the hearts of all who knew and talked to him, whether corporate president, or shopkeeper or working man; and</blockquote><blockquote name="ac0c" id="ac0c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Whereas, No granite monument, no photographer’s eye, nor artist’s pen could ever adequately capture his quick wit, his jaunty step, his vigorous attack on the problems of the City and its people; and</blockquote><blockquote name="975a" id="975a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Whereas, A fitting symbol of Mayor Richard J. Daley’s spirit would be a fifth star added to the City’s flag because his life and energy were devoted to making this City a better place for all to live and work and his years among us were surely one of our City’s most significant eras, comparable even to the City’s Founding; …</blockquote><p name="b590" id="b590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But the aldermen never voted on an ordinance that would actually change the law to add the fifth star.</p><h3 name="c8fa" id="c8fa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Out of obscurity</h3><p name="a23f" id="a23f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In spite of its lovely design, Chicago’s city flag was not widely known or popular for decades.</p><p name="6eb3" id="6eb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1948, Mayor Martin Kennelly started “a one man crusade” to educate Chicagoans about their flag. He kept a pile of postcards showing the flag in his desk and handed them out to City Hall visitors.</p><p name="7d22" id="7d22" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I didn’t know what the flag was until I was elected,” he said, “and I didn’t learn what it meant until recently when I presented one to the Art Institute. I think it’s a fine thing for buildings to fly the city flag.”</p><p name="63c2" id="63c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1958, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tribune</em> reported:</p><blockquote name="afd0" id="afd0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Lloyd Schumacher raised a Chicago flag outside his hardware store at 3634 N. Central av. a month ago and since then has been busy answering questions.</blockquote><blockquote name="c3c4" id="c3c4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Few people recognize the city’s flag, Schumacher said, and have mistaken it for everything from the flag of Israel to that of one of the Scandinavian countries. It’s gotten to the point, he said Monday, that he’s so busy answering questions there is little time left to sell tenpenny nails or a brace of carpenter’s tools. Schumacher said he is displaying the Chicago flag because he is a booster of the city and doesn’t think the flag is seen often enough. He plans to keep flying the flag.</blockquote><p name="b078" id="b078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And in 1959, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Chicago American </em>reported:</p><blockquote name="bdaf" id="bdaf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">You have to look far and wide to find a flag of Chicago in the city. In fact, you have to look farther and wider before you can find a Chicagoan who knows the city has its own flag.</blockquote><blockquote name="5c2f" id="5c2f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">One of the few buildings flying the colorful four-star flag is City Hall. A police was asked by a reporter if he knew what flag was displayed next to the Stars and Stripes on the La Salle street side of the building. The policeman pondered a moment. Then his face came alive with inspiration. He replied: “That’s in honor of Israel, I think. You notice that the stars have six points.” …</blockquote><blockquote name="6818" id="6818" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">A check of flag manufacturers and distributors in the city showed few have any variety of sizes of Chicago flags in stock — if they have them at all. A Loop distributor volunteered: “We just don’t get many calls for them. You can see for yourself. It’s on the City Hall, but where else?”</blockquote><p name="6d7a" id="6d7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In the late 1960s, Daley may have boosted the flag’s visibility by sending flags to Chicagoans serving in the Vietnam War. After he sent a flag to Lance Corporal David Marchi, the soldier wrote a letter to the mayor: “As you can see in the pictures, I am keeping the flag flying high. You’d be surprised how it boosted morale when some of the men found out my mayor sent it to me. They are now sending away for flags also.”</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3b70" id="3b70" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 746px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 74.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KVYMCorNzbf37tD8p5h9eQ.jpeg" data-width="1800" data-height="1343" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*KVYMCorNzbf37tD8p5h9eQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*KVYMCorNzbf37tD8p5h9eQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by Robert Loerzel</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a2bc" id="a2bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">An art display now on the Harold Washington Library Center’s third floor includes a large photo showing a Chicago flag flying in 1970 at an American encampment in Vietnam.
