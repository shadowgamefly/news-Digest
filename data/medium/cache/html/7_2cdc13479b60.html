When You Believe You Have All the Answers, You Stop Learning</strong></h3><p name="e893" id="e893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s easy to believe this when you have some degree of success. A few weeks ago I spoke to Dan Lerner who teaches a science of happiness course at NYU. He told me a story about a woman’s soccer coach who has the best record in NCAA history. Despite his record, when he met Dan, all he did was ask questions. He told Dan “when I was younger I thought I knew everything.” Don’t ever stop asking questions.

I suppose that’s because I graduated into two recessions. I couldn’t find a real job so I made one up. I started doing the work that I wanted to get paid for even though nobody was paying me for it. I started building a body of work instead of a resume.</p><p name="dd72" id="dd72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you ask me about learning, I’d point you to my bookshelf.

But it enables you to navigate life’s challenges with a sense of calm and grace. Even when you take real antidepressants the highs aren’t as high. But if it means the lows aren’t as low, I think it’s a small price to pay. Sometimes you can’t self-help your way out of depression. That being said you shouldn’t abandon practices like gratitude and meditation. Medication isn’t a substitute for those things.

It was definitely not something I was proud to put my signature on. I was trying to turn a resume that looked more like a rap sheet into something worthy of a top ten MBA.

When you take that last breath, what you’ll be able to take with you are the hearts you’ve touched, the stories you’ve told, and the difference you’ve made.

The math doesn’t quite work for me. I used to think that what happened in romantic comedies was what relationships were supposed to be like. But a few real life experiences altered that perception. I guess you could say I finally stopped being what my friend Rachel Resnick would call a “love junkie.” It’s not that I don’t believe in chemistry and sparks.

What you Fear Most Will Also Change</strong></h3><p name="6a44" id="6a44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For a good amount of my 20’s, I had this tremendous fear of ending up alone. After having a couple of girlfriends, that fear went away. I’m almost 40 and I think one thing that scares me the most is that one or both of my parents won’t be around to see what are apparently two of the most important experiences of life: getting married and having kids. At the same time, you probably don’t want to make such an important life decision out of fear.</p><p name="3777" id="3777" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few weeks ago I had a chance to speak to the director of the Zen Hospice project.

But regardless it always helped, even if it was just a little bit. “Anger is a terrible quality” is another thing my dad has said to me over and over again in my life. I think I can count the number of times he’s been truly angry or yelled at me on two hands.</p><p name="5983" id="5983" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we say things out of anger, we say things we’ll regret, and we run the risk of doing irreversible damage to our relationships. To top it all off, if we’re angry, pissed off, and a time bomb waiting to go off at any minute, nobody will want to spend time with us.

I still do. And sometimes I got made fun of for them. My friend David Falwell even nicknamed me “lips” when we were in the 7th grade. My lips were helpful for learning to play the tuba. That’s probably why I played the tuba because my lips couldn’t fit into any other mouthpiece. As an adult, all the women I’ve kissed seemed thrilled about this (the lips, not the Tuba).

That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t set such goals. We learn more from the pursuit of a goal than we do from its accomplishment. It’s the pursuit that changes us. I had a goal to become a NY Times bestselling author. I didn’t accomplish that goal, but in pursuit of it, I transformed many of my habits, behaviors, and beliefs. Transformation is the ultimate purpose any goal. No matter how grand the accomplishment, the buzz and the novelty will eventually wear off.

But what we can strive for is unconditional happiness</p><p name="1040" id="1040" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We spend so much of our lives trying to change ourselves and our circumstances.
