So, I wasn’t that familiar with other performers.</p><p name="20e4" id="20e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a child, I was already very busy performing in school and amateur productions. Some people grow up saying “I want to be like so-and-so,” but that didn’t enter my thought process. I didn’t even have a thought process — I simply started performing at three years old, and I was off to the races.</p><p name="61a2" id="61a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Can you pinpoint the moment where you knew that you wanted to become an actress?</strong></p><p name="782d" id="782d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I was already performing from the age of three, in amateur and school productions, it was just a natural evolution. My first performances were in dance; I did my first TV show at five (a television program in Memphis, Tenn.), and my first school operetta (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Peter and the Wolf</em>) at seven, so performing was always there for me, like breathing.</p><p name="c3ac" id="c3ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only moment I remember which <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">crystallized </em>my already existing goals was in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Peter and the Wolf</em>. I played a bird, complete with head, beak, and footed pajamas. I was on the stage, flapping my chicken feather wings, and the audience began enthusiastically clapping in the middle of my performance.</p><p name="4207" id="4207" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I liked that, and remember thinking, “Ohhh, I can do this!” So, the more they clapped, the more I flapped. That moment of realization that I could create an effect on an audience was exhilarating and addictive. The stage manager practically had to drag me off that stage so the show could continue.</p><p name="f66b" id="f66b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My maternal grandmother, Shellie McKnight, who was my role model, always said that I told her at the age of 2½ years old that I was going to be an actress and buy her a big car. No, I didn’t buy her that car, but I did take her to Europe for the trip of a lifetime when I finally had money. She preferred that over the car!</p><p name="185b" id="185b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She set a good example for me as she was a working woman long before it was common for all women to work. She was a professional nurse, and was also bi-coastal at a time when that was rare. I was fortunate in that I had also had several wonderful aunts who had excellent careers in the corporate world, government, nursing, etc. So, I knew what it was to work by observing the examples of my grandmother and aunts, all fiercely independent women.</p><p name="5405" id="5405" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No one in my family was a professional in any creative profession, so my natural tendency to be an artist certainly wasn’t inherited, encouraged, or nurtured. I was a “Stranger in a Strange Land” (Robert A. Heinlein). So, there was no “moment”, no epiphany, when I “decided” to be a performer. I was born with the creative drive.</p><p name="3727" id="3727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time that I was constantly performing while growing up, I was also writing, painting, drawing, playing musical instruments, being in a band, doing photography, and dying my hair purple. I’m still a writer, still love photography and plink on my piano now and then.</p><figure name="d5b0" id="d5b0" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 524px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 99.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XzxMtBgGZRngYJ-QEnw3hA.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="959" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*XzxMtBgGZRngYJ-QEnw3hA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XzxMtBgGZRngYJ-QEnw3hA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Lee Purcell looks to be a supremely confident, precocious seven-year-old in this circa 1955 candid.

But, they were not at all supportive when I announced one day, while still in my teens, that I was leaving alone for California to be a professional actress. They were horrified. However, my grandmother was emotionally very supportive. After all, she had already left home to pursue a career!</p><p name="29e0" id="29e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I never discussed my acting aspirations with my parents, until the day I left for California. It would have been like announcing I was flying to Mars on the wings of an eagle. So, I just quietly kept my dreams of being a professional actress to myself and privately made my own plans.</p><p name="9242" id="9242" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was 13 years old, I already recognized that my thinking process was “outside the box” and that I would never be able to submit to the status quo that was expected of me. To do so would have destroyed my spirit.</p><p name="1971" id="1971" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew that someday I would need my own money to finance my future, as I surmised I wouldn’t be receiving any financial help from any one to do what I wanted to do in life. So, I walked a very long distance to a bank, opened a secret savings account (you could do that as a minor in those days) and saved every penny I received and earned for the next several years. I still have that little bank savings book, just in case I need a tangible reminder to have courage. It’s my talisman.</p><p name="5f99" id="5f99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I left for California, my mother gave me $85.00. My parents made a private bet that I would be back in a week (my late mother confessed this to me many years later). My grandmother knew better. So, I simply drove away alone to make my life into what I wanted it to be.</p><p name="9d5a" id="9d5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be so crushing for me to have never spread my wings, to have never taken a chance, to have lived my life in a pre-determined bubble, in the safe zone, never having taken that leap of faith or never having relied solely on my wits and courage.</p><p name="b06e" id="b06e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know people who have denied their true self, and it is tragic. Your true self can be anything you can dream up, that you feel in your heart of hearts. It can be a dream of owning a hardware store (what my grandfather did) because you love working with your hands, fixing things, helping people fix their homes, but if you deny that, and do something else, you will always have that twinge of regret.</p><p name="9208" id="9208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s a hard life, to be trapped in your own fear, or lack of imagination. It’s easier to jump off the cliff without a parachute, metaphorically speaking, than it is to spend your life peeking over the edge.</p><figure name="3c45" id="3c45" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 512px; max-height: 800px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 156.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZYEZCXURx64zgXrztfVbMQ.jpeg" data-width="512" data-height="800" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZYEZCXURx64zgXrztfVbMQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">“I like creating something or other all the time.

As I didn’t know how to shop for food or how to cook, my one meal was usually a box of cookies and a carton of milk from the local deli.</p><p name="24bc" id="24bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The place I lived was in a derelict apartment building in a bad neighborhood. It was condemned and torn down shortly after I moved out. The fine residents there were very pre-occupied shooting themselves up with drugs in the front hallway, so I didn’t use the front door to the building.</p><p name="1264" id="1264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My squalid little apartment (called a “studio” apartment) was on the ground floor with windows onto the parking lot, so I used the window like my own personal front door and would just climb in and out to enter and exit.</p><p name="06da" id="06da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That way I could avoid the drug addicts at the front entrance. They still broke into my apartment and stole my little bit of hard-earned money. I had no car, so I learned to hitchhike, and there was also a bus stop a few blocks from my apartment, which I could take when I could afford the fare, which was not often.</p><p name="b134" id="b134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The location where this awful building stood has been a parking lot ever since the building was torn down. Ironically, whenever I go to the annual American Film Market, I have to walk right by the location of my former apartment, as the area has been somewhat “gentrified” in recent years.</p><p name="d0a7" id="d0a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My parents never saw how I lived during those early days, but my grandmother did, and she was justifiably horrified. I think experiences like these give you strength of character — if you survive them!</p><p name="d5db" id="d5db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my opinion, if you don’t follow your dreams, you’re spiritually and emotionally dead.

That’s a soul-killer.</p><p name="daf6" id="daf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A couple of years later, I took another grand leap of faith and moved to England and also studied acting there, so I have a good, international grounding in my craft.</p><figure name="c790" id="c790" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 350px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1GTDEjIZDeZ1Yqzc2Mjikw.jpeg" data-width="530" data-height="353" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*1GTDEjIZDeZ1Yqzc2Mjikw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1GTDEjIZDeZ1Yqzc2Mjikw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Carol Worthey, Patrick Culliton, Marty Kove, Joni Labaqui (ASI), David Carradine [Old Doc], Lee Purcell, and Bob Caso [narrator] represent the L.

But really, more from Western art, which I still love.</p><p name="c224" id="c224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Younger people today sadly did not grow up on Westerns, whereas every other preceding generation, since film was invented, did. So, it is largely unfamiliar territory to the younger generation.</p><p name="4150" id="4150" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since I grew up watching Westerns, and have starred in several, particularly in film, I love them. I recall a particularly gratifying conversation I had with a very astute 15-year-old young man who quoted dialogue from the Coen Brothers’ remake of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">True Grit</em> to me as he loved it so much.</p><p name="d106" id="d106" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I attended the Dolby Theatre premiere of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Homesman</em>, a Western starring Hilary Swank and directed by Tommy Lee Jones, and loved it. If someone decides to do a remake of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gunsmoke</em>, I’m throwing my hat in the ring to be Miss Kitty!</p><p name="17c8" id="17c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Your charity efforts are very dear to your heart.</strong></p><p name="c6d3" id="c6d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, they are. Anything to do with helping animals and assisting our veterans is dear to my heart. I am on the board of Heart of a Horse, an organization that saves abused and neglected horses. Horses have always had a huge emotional impact on me.</p><p name="6b76" id="6b76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What’s on your to-do list?</strong></p><p name="7ebf" id="7ebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reading scripts and looking for another role I like. And writing, directing and producing.</p><p name="a23e" id="a23e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you enjoy doing when not working?</strong></p><p name="a3cc" id="a3cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My fun “down-time” is when I’m writing or creating something new, decorating, traveling, entertaining, seeing movies or plays, playing piano, spending time with family, friends and my dogs, taking photos, and having adventures. I also enjoy performing at my home theatre company, Theatre West.</p><p name="3729" id="3729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like creating something or other all the time. That is my life’s work, whether being paid or not. I can’t imagine any other life.</p><figure name="41cd" id="41cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="480" data-height="360" width="480" height="360" src="/media/2a3ba4748a890a33c022cc5ba5d0b8f2?postId=7e53e4a9c691" data-media-id="2a3ba4748a890a33c022cc5ba5d0b8f2" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs2.dmcdn.net%2FT1eoj%2Fx240-nMZ.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Click to watch Lee Purcell in “The Dexter Crisis,” the tenth episode of season one of “The Rockford Files” broadcast on November 15, 1974.
