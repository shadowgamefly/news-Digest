In it, Baumol — frustrated with the idea that entrepreneurship was this quixotic thing that waxed and waned for unexplained reasons — set out to get the bottom of why it was that in some circumstances it flourished; in others, it seemed to wither.</p><p name="7062" id="7062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He reached the most unexpected of conclusions.</p><p name="a7ac" id="a7ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than entrepreneurship arising and disappearing as if by magic — Baumol realized we’d simply been categorizing things incorrectly. Whereas the traditional view of the entrepreneur was of folks developing innovations and creating new markets, Baumol countered that entrepreneurs are simply “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">persons who are ingenious and creative in finding ways that add to their own wealth, power, and prestige”</em>.</p><figure name="3d43" id="3d43" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 479px; max-height: 259px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 54.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*om8Gc5ToJLr_WXHcjjNm0A.jpeg" data-width="479" data-height="259" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*om8Gc5ToJLr_WXHcjjNm0A.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="cb43" id="cb43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When you take that view of things, suddenly you realize: it doesn’t matter where you are… there are entrepreneurs all around you. It’s just they don’t always conform with our traditional stereotypes of what an “entrepreneur” is. And herein lies the first of Baumol’s two great insights:</p><p name="5e68" id="5e68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is such a thing as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bad entrepreneurship</em>.</p><p name="6963" id="6963" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If entrepreneurs are “ingenious and creative folks pursuing wealth, power, prestige”, then they will pursue those goals in whatever way makes most sense. That might mean starting a company in a garage in Silicon Valley — which is the image that “entrepreneurship” typically calls to mind. But it doesn’t need to be so grand — it also includes starting a small business in your local community. Baumol calls this <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">productive entrepreneurship</strong>.</p><figure name="f32e" id="f32e" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 225px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 42.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZbjVOpbdeFebSxz2HLNZmw.jpeg" data-width="700" data-height="300" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*ZbjVOpbdeFebSxz2HLNZmw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZbjVOpbdeFebSxz2HLNZmw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="06c9" id="06c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">At the other end of the scale, you’ll find people getting rich off others’ misery — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">destructive entrepreneurship</strong>.

These heated debates and deeped political divides are nothing new.</p><p name="5b24" id="5b24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it was far from all good news.</p><p name="6a9c" id="6a9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In reviewing hundreds of years of policy debates, Moss began to notice that something very fundamental had changed. Up until (roughly) the end of World War 2, almost all policy were organized around a central theme: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">impact on democracy</strong>. The question would be asked: what was this going to mean for our democracy? From both sides of the political spectrum, there was a common commitment to strengthening and preserving democratic ideals.</p><p name="05ae" id="05ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, starting around the time of the Great Depression in the 1930s, and taking full effect by roughly the end of the 1940s, that changed.</p><p name="951d" id="951d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No longer was the focus on democracy. Economic growth pushed it the background.</p><p name="30b9" id="30b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One example that Moss cites to show this evolution is broadcast regulation. The first time Congress dealt with this issue was in the mid-1920s — right after the first commercial radio broadcast in 1920.</p><figure name="9714" id="9714" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 336px; max-height: 270px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 80.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0aDMVkhUxrlrs391_bhtVA.png" data-width="336" data-height="270" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0aDMVkhUxrlrs391_bhtVA.png"></div></figure><p name="31cc" id="31cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While there were all manner of technical and economic elements to the policy debate that happened, at the heart of the debate, was an intense focus on the implications for society. This cut across both sides of politics: what would be the impact of this new technology, and the industry that was springing up around it, on American democracy?</p><p name="b1db" id="b1db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was broad recognition in Congress that if anyone managed to gain complete radio dominance in a town, city, region or country, then they would have a lock on political discourse in that region. Because the policy debate focused on impact on democracy, Congress recognized this could happen.<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> And it feared it</em>. As a result, spectrum was retained under Government control, and was licensed out to private parties.</p><p name="7191" id="7191" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fast forward to the 1960s, and a very different debate was happening on allocation of spectrum. It had the same technical and economic elements as in the 1920s — which, of course, is no bad thing. But the nature of the change was stark. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The focus on the impact of democracy had largely disappeared</em>. It had been crowded out entirely by the economic focus.</p><p name="d645" id="d645" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I heard Moss talk about this, he was at pains to say that this was his <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">impression</em> from researching the history of all these policy debates. But he did attempt to provide a quantification of the effect. Recognizing that it’s far from perfect, he used Google’s ngram tool to look at how “economy” (including it’s old world spelling, “oeconomy”) compared to usage in literature of the words “republic” and “democracy”.</p><figure name="d62b" id="d62b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 271px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 38.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DVNWxK7bDIMl4u9BpAfKzA.png" data-width="2130" data-height="824" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*DVNWxK7bDIMl4u9BpAfKzA.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DVNWxK7bDIMl4u9BpAfKzA.png"></div></figure><p name="c096" id="c096" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">The timelines match Moss’s impression of the policy debates.</p></div></div></section><section name="f700" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="2dde" id="2dde" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">There is an important, and somewhat counter-intutitive insight here: the best way to keep an economy healthy isn’t by prioritizing the economy.</p><p name="55cd" id="55cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It’s by prioritizing democracy</em>.</p><p name="ff61" id="ff61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This focus on democracy is what keeps destructive and unproductive entrepreneurship at bay. When wealthy special interests come knocking on governmental doors — and given the nature of entrepreneurs, those knocks will happen, accompanied by promises of campaign contributions in exchange for favorable policy— on what basis do policy makers make their decision of what to do? I genuinely believe that most actors on both sides of this equation — in business, and in government — are good people. They’re motivated to do good. But they have a set of forces working on them to behave in a certain way in such a situation.</p><p name="19a4" id="19a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The business leaders? That’s easy. They’re looking to profit. They’ll do so however they can, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">within the rules of the game</em>. There are two levers implicit in that statement: play the game as it stands. Or change the rules.</p><p name="4d22" id="4d22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the policy-makers? Well, they’re looking to get re-elected. With that as the goal, their criteria for judging whether a policy is worth pursuing is two-fold. First, how are voters going to react? Because if they don’t like this, and they change their vote… well I’m out of office.</p><p name="a783" id="a783" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But second — if voters don’t care, is this going to help me get re-elected? Well, here’s a representative from one of the pillars of our economy saying this will help them out. This means I’m helping the economy, right? And it doesn’t seem to be hurting anyone (of course, you can’t hear the silent screams of a disruptive business that will never be created as a result of bad policy). And to top it off — here’s this big pile of money I need to help get re-elected — so I can keep helping the country!</p><p name="0219" id="0219" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s been missing for the past seventy years is the test of: “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">is this good for democracy</strong>?”. When this is applied — well, corporate leaders would be a little more reluctant to just buy their next set of quarterly earnings from Capitol Hill. Instead, they’d do it the hard way — through competition (which, as a happy side-effect, benefits society).</p><p name="81a0" id="81a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And regulators?
