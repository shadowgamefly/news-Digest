those who have been following the New York Knicks since at least after the All-Star break, you should be well aware that the team has officially <a href="https://twitter.com/SBondyNYDN/status/836652640742289409" data-href="https://twitter.com/SBondyNYDN/status/836652640742289409" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">committed to the Triangle Offense</a>. This transition to the triangle has caused quite a stir both in the locker room and in the press. Here is a taste of what both parties are saying about the Triangle. Here is Ian Begley of ESPN New York in his “Phil Jackson’s Knicks anniversary” <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18941092/nba-unhappy-anniversary-tidings-phil-jackson-three-years-new-york" data-href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18941092/nba-unhappy-anniversary-tidings-phil-jackson-three-years-new-york" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a> from a little more than a week ago where he mixes both his opinion and sourced claims:</p><blockquote name="638f" id="638f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Jackson may eventually be able to find players who excel in — and appreciate — the triangle. But the majority of current Knicks aren’t comfortable in — and don’t care for — the offense, according to sources.</blockquote><blockquote name="9f7b" id="9f7b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">These players often point to the amount of midrange shots the offense produces (the Knicks lead the league in midrange attempts, per NBA.com) and the tight spacing, which makes it difficult to drive. They also question the amount of contested shots taken (New York ranks in the top 10 in contested 2-point field goals, per NBA.com).</blockquote><p name="7708" id="7708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If the dysfunction continues, no one should be surprised if Porzingis and Hernangomez leave the franchise in free agency. That, of course, would be the biggest black eye of Jackson’s presidency.</p><p name="f4c4" id="f4c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The majority of the Knicks roster would mean that at least seven players do not like the offense. Currently, only Carmelo Anthony (see quote further down) and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/derrick-rose-embracing-knicks-triangle-choice-article-1.2987372" data-href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/derrick-rose-embracing-knicks-triangle-choice-article-1.2987372" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a> have voiced any sort of public, on-the-record criticism against the offense. On the contrary, Kristaps Porzingis, the future of the Knicks franchise, <a href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/knicks/kristaps-porzingis-a-fan-of-the-knicks-triangle-offense-1.13193523" data-href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/knicks/kristaps-porzingis-a-fan-of-the-knicks-triangle-offense-1.13193523" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">likes the triangle</a>: “I like the triangle. My first season, the whole first season we played nothing but the triangle so I know it pretty well. I like the offense. It can only work if everybody believes in it and everybody executes it the right way.”</p><p name="feef" id="feef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is Matt Moore of CBS Sports commenting on the triangle in two different reports, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-knicks-players-sick-of-the-triangle-losing-faith-in-jeff-hornacek-because-of-it/" data-href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-knicks-players-sick-of-the-triangle-losing-faith-in-jeff-hornacek-because-of-it/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">one from earlier in the week</a> and another from <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/not-good-new-york-carmelo-anthony-buries-phil-jacksons-beloved-triangle/" data-href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/not-good-new-york-carmelo-anthony-buries-phil-jacksons-beloved-triangle/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a few days ago</a>:</p><blockquote name="847c" id="847c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Here’s a quick question. What current players actually espouse a love for the triangle? The guards that have played in it hate it, with a blinding passion. But no player comes out and says “the triangle is the best.” It’s only former players who won with it, or sycophants who worship at Jackson’s altar after his 11 rings.</blockquote><blockquote name="f5e4" id="f5e4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The idea behind the Triangle, according to the Post, is that Jackson claimed it would help improve the defense with how it’s designed, to limit transition scores for the opponent. The head of the Knicks’ defense, of course, isn’t Hornacek, but longtime triangle disciple Kurt Rambis who, by the way, was installed specifically by Jackson.

Once you get into the season, it’s hard to readjust a whole system.’’</blockquote><p name="6e9c" id="6e9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The “little winning streak” Melo references was between during a stretch of 20 games between mid-November and right before Christmas Day where the Knicks went 13–7. Despite the good record, the Knicks had an overall net rating of -0.7 and a road net rating of -3.9 (with a defensive rating of 109.1) over that 9-game sample, per <a href="http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612752/advanced/?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=11%2F14%2F2016&amp;DateTo=12%2F22%2F2016" data-href="http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612752/advanced/?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=11%2F14%2F2016&amp;DateTo=12%2F22%2F2016" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>. The timeline Anthony mentions also does not align with the reports. The Knicks did not officially switch over to the triangle until after the All-Star break. The Knicks were 11 games under .500 entering the break and they were running a “faster and more free-flowing” offense during that stretch — it clearly wasn’t working nor overcoming their atrocious defense.</p><p name="6429" id="6429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of this recent wave of hate for the triangle, which has been going on since Jackson became the Knicks President of Basketball Operations near the end of the 2013–14 NBA season, it only seems both relevant and important to provide a guide to the triangle offense. The triangle faces a fair amount of criticism, with the main talking points being “it generates too many long 2-point shots”, “it is too rigid and isn’t free-flowing”, “it’s antiquated for today’s NBA game”, and “certain teams run <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">aspects of the triangle </em>but not the entire offense”.</p><p name="222f" id="222f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Are these criticisms fair?

The system is possibly the most recognizable offensive system any casual NBA fan can recognize by name, yet very few people outside of Phil Jackson’s coaching pyramid can describe the intricacies of the offense with any sort of clarity. Almost everyone knows the basics, but the people who know more than the system’s basic player placement on the court are few and far between.</p><p name="af8e" id="af8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is offensive system that promotes and encourages the same basic tenets of any motion or “free-flowing” offense: quick passing, constant off the ball movement, careful and specific spacing, and efficiency. This combination of ball and player movement allows for all five players on the court to be interchangeable in the offensive spots. This flexibility the Triangle creates allows a team to present different different offense looks and sets to the defense. When executed properly, the offense is quite difficult to predict and scout as the offense is not forcing the defense to react, but rather the offense reacting to what the defense is presenting.</p><p name="d467" id="d467" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t just take my word for it, this is how an unnamed coach — he wanted to remain anonymous because he “fears being perceived as a ‘Triangle coach’ could marginalize his reputation.” — described the offense to Chuck Klosterman in a 2012 <a href="http://grantland.com/features/chuck-klosterman-phil-jackson-tex-winter-death-triangle-offense/" data-href="http://grantland.com/features/chuck-klosterman-phil-jackson-tex-winter-death-triangle-offense/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grantland article</a> about the Triangle:</p><blockquote name="46c6" id="46c6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">1. The Triangle is considered a “flow offense,” in which player movement is the most important detail (set plays are rare). It’s also considered a “mirror offense,” because the same things happen on each side of the floor. Neither of these qualities is unique or even uncommon.</blockquote><blockquote name="eb2d" id="eb2d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">2. The strength of the offense is that all five players are interchangeable and that anyone on the floor can occupy the post (assuming that player has the best post matchup).</blockquote><blockquote name="458d" id="458d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">3. There are passes players are automatically supposed to make if they receive the ball at certain positions on the floor against specific defensive alignments. These decisions are called “automatics” (and those automatics are what the players need to mentally internalize).</blockquote><p name="d09d" id="d09d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What are the positions on the court and what are these “automatics” players must know? Player positions in the Triangle are simple. There is a strong side and a weak side, with the strong side consisting of one player in the post, one player in the corner, and one player on the wing and the weak side having a player above the break and other in the high post, or “pinch post” as it’s commonly referred to, with all players spaced out between 15 through 20 feet apart (ideally 18 feet) from one another, forming a … you guessed it, a triangle!</p><figure name="a57c" id="a57c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 392px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.00000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0oH5LcraL18K2CpJq1w_-Q.png" data-width="856" data-height="479" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*0oH5LcraL18K2CpJq1w_-Q.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0oH5LcraL18K2CpJq1w_-Q.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Image via BBallBreakdown</figcaption></figure><p name="b641" id="b641" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To initiate the offense traditionally, the player bringing the ball up the court will pass to the player on the strong side wing and cut to the corner. Once this is completed, this begins the different sequence of “automatics” in the Triangle, which are predetermined reactions to what the defense is showing. As Doug Eberhardt explains in his <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/10/23/7041727/phil-jackson-triangle-offense" data-href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/10/23/7041727/phil-jackson-triangle-offense" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2014 article</a> on the offense, “Think of them as personal algorithms, the computations of which are drilled relentlessly in practice.”</p><p name="843e" id="843e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As seen in the video clip below, an entry pass to the post player is given by the player on the wing. Then, both the wing and the initial ball handler in the corner cut to the weak side. Once those cuts are complete, the players set a screen for the weak side post player for him to potentially receive a pass at the top of the key, which in turn create for another set of cuts and passes.</p><figure name="f603" id="f603" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/92edf1d7d410eef21973b0699e1aadeb?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="92edf1d7d410eef21973b0699e1aadeb" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fy6xyu.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491839844_992333d753ec9221b1a614bf3eadace7564fd2ef&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="b2a1" id="b2a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This example, of course, does not work out this 100% of the time, but the main take away from this should be the first automatic being the pass to the post.

Phil Jackson thinks so. This is what he told Mr. Klosterman in the aforementioned Grantland article:</p><blockquote name="6c4e" id="6c4e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The Triangle is extremely simple,” Jackson insists. “You just need enough energy to get up and down the floor, because it’s a 94-foot offense. Everything happens in 4/4 time, like rap music. That’s how I always described the tempo to players.”</blockquote><p name="0469" id="0469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Mr. Klosterman then mentions that after saying this, Phil then went on to detail the approximately 35 different options that can be performed when the ball is reversed to the top of the key. Just image how long this article would be if I detailed examples of those 35 options just off of one ball reversal. Is the Triangle actually more complicated than Jackson is letting on? “Having taught it at the high school level to players much less skilled than the pros, my feeling is that it isn’t that hard,” is what Coach Nick of <a href="https://bballbreakdown.com/about/" data-href="https://bballbreakdown.com/about/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BBallBreakdown</a> told 16 Wins a Ring. “You have to know the offense inside and out and more importantly, have to be a good teacher.”</p><p name="7277" id="7277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The one common factor in both the Bulls and Lakers championships other than Phil Jackson and elite talent was assistant coach Tex Winter. Winter is the mastermind behind the Triangle Offense. As Coach Nick explained, Winter’s “attention to detail was as important as anything Phil did. Without him, other teams have struggled to adhere to its principles properly — hence dooming it to fail.”</p><p name="2069" id="2069" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those failures of other teams are truly notable. Jim Cleamons did not even reach 100 games coached during the mid-90s with the Mavericks and has a 28.6 winning percentage, while Kurt Rambis coached 229 games with the Timberwolves and has a worse winning percentage of 28.4, per <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/NBA_stats.html" data-href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/NBA_stats.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Basketball-Reference</a>. And what usually is blamed for these failures, including those of the New York Knicks under Jackson, is the Triangle offense, which in turn creates a stigma for the system around the league, the media, and the fans that are not necessarily true.</p><p name="e80d" id="e80d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The Triangle generates too many long 2-point shots” has been one of the newer criticism levied against the system — as demonstrated earlier via Ian Begley. The issue with this criticism is its causal direction. Is the triangle creating long 2-point shots for the Knicks because those are the shots the triangle generates or are the Knicks using the triangle to create long 2-point shots because it suits the strengths of the roster? As you can see, we have a chicken versus the egg scenario.</p><p name="4fc4" id="4fc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">New York does currently lead the NBA in midrange shot attempts, per <a href="http://stats.nba.com/teams/shooting/#!?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&amp;dir=1" data-href="http://stats.nba.com/teams/shooting/#!?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&amp;dir=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>, but that isn’t because of the Triangle.

There also is nothing inherently wrong with taking midrange jump shots if a team is converting those shots at a high percentage (the Knicks are 7th in midrange FG%). As I detailed in a previous article, converting midrange jump shots at a high percentage is quite important to the success of an NBA team.</p><div name="8807" id="8807" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@thedrewzoo/where-are-the-best-shooting-zones-on-the-court-b2dbf0930bfb" data-href="https://medium.com/@thedrewzoo/where-are-the-best-shooting-zones-on-the-court-b2dbf0930bfb" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@thedrewzoo/where-are-the-best-shooting-zones-on-the-court-b2dbf0930bfb"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Where Are The Best Shooting Zones On The Court?</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">We are told that certain areas on the court are better than others.

Check out the chart below detailing the Lakers shooting shot field goal attempts (field goal percentage ranking in parentheses) during Jackson’s second stint with the team. As you can see, the Laker’s shooting zone figures mirror the findings in my study, where they were in the Top-10 in shooting efficiency in the restrict area and in the paint more often than not, as well as always in the top half in 3-point shot attempts above the break. Even if you look at the shooting zone numbers during Jackson’s first stint with the Shaq &amp; Kobe Lakers, the numbers are similar.</p><figure name="97d5" id="97d5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 256px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 40%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xl25fcXl-kF2zwZNIr9q4w.png" data-width="640" data-height="256" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xl25fcXl-kF2zwZNIr9q4w.png"></div></figure><p name="f04a" id="f04a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Keep in mind that this is still a time before the significant emphasis on 3-point shooting above the break. The Orando Magic lead the league in 3-point shot attempts above the break during the 2010–11 season with 18.9 FGA. That figure would rank 18th this year, slightly ahead of the New York Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder who both average 18.7 FGA from above the break. And the Lakers’ 23rd ranked 24.2 FGA figure would be 5th this year. With all of this being said, within the context of eras, the Lakers were not taking as many midrange field goal attempts as most teams.</p><p name="f55d" id="f55d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, if the Triangle offense <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">does not </em></strong>generate midrange shots, what type of shots does it generate? “The Triangle Offense is designed to generate OPEN shots,” according to Coach Nick. He continues to elaborate on this topic by telling 16 Wins a Ring the following:</p><blockquote name="0210" id="0210" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Where those shots come from relies a lot on the individual abilities of the players running it. It also requires a coach who can shepherd the players to certain spots on the floor to generate their shots. The 3 point shooters the Bulls and Lakers had never had issues getting their 3 pointers, and with so many more players able to shoot the 3, it wouldn’t be a problem for them either. It’s simply a matter of choosing which route to run in the offense — rather than cut to a spot that is 22 feet away, they simply cut to the spot behind the 3 point line.</blockquote><p name="dbb2" id="dbb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Therefore, if a team like the New York Knicks have players who primarily take their shots in the midrange, they are going to run actions out of the triangle to ensure that they get shots in their prefered places.</p><p name="e4b9" id="e4b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, the most recognizable critique of the Triangle offense is that the system is antiquated; a relic of previous NBA era, so to speak. This criticism also is not entirely fair nor true given that the majority of NBA teams run many of the basic actions outlined previously. If you do not want to use the Knicks as the example of the modern usage of the Triangle (and understandably so), then look no further than the Golden State Warriors. Now, it should be noted that the Warriors do not run the Triangle offense like the Knicks, Lakers, or Bulls. They are the epitome of a team that runs “aspects of the triangle” (they also have a roster with elite talent and that talent buying into what Steve Kerr is selling, something that cannot be overlooked). One may even say that the Warriors run the Triangle Offense 2.0 since the offense they run adheres to all of the same principles of the triangle, uses many of its actions, but is not as bound to its structure in terms of player placement on the court.</p><p name="022f" id="022f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are the Warriors setting up what appears to be the basic and initial triangle setup:</p><figure name="d052" id="d052" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/d52dfae58b18af95507c73e7b2464781?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="d52dfae58b18af95507c73e7b2464781" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fhzr3q.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840013_1dcad07d2b6d638acf6a45b69ab69f4172672429&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="d859" id="d859" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Steph Curry brings the ball up the court, passes to Andre Iguodala, and proceeds to cut to the corner with the assistance of a Draymond Green screen, who came up from a post position to set it. As Curry continues to the corner, Iguodala then passes to Green. But instead of going all the way to the corner like the traditional Triangle dictates, Curry comes back to set a screen on Iguodala’s defender, freeing up a large cutting lane. Green gives a cutting Iguodala an amazing bounce pass leading to an easy dunk.</p><p name="56a5" id="56a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s these little wrinkles and adjustments to the Triangle that make the Warriors such an elite offense. Not constricting themselves by having their players set up specifically in spots on the court frees them to run more Triangle-kosher actions. One of these wrinkles that the team uses frequently is initiating the offense via a Green or Durant weak side post up, but not crowd the lane with another player in the post on the strongside.</p><figure name="4aa9" id="4aa9" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/88897b1d26971b9ab8ba27d4b305af4d?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="88897b1d26971b9ab8ba27d4b305af4d" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fk9lms.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840018_b452692377d347eec064d2e6063191fa7ba39679&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><figure name="4a7d" id="4a7d" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/dc520005af9540cc859443ffedc5c960?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="dc520005af9540cc859443ffedc5c960" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fhvtq9.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840022_37330add73a41b6780e089c816b6bea17929fde6&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="63af" id="63af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The Warriors also run good ole pinch post actions, as well as traditional weak side post up actions with another player in the post area with Green and Durant.</p><figure name="b849" id="b849" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/279b4bfb2ac3c01c12f34d0611a21439?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="279b4bfb2ac3c01c12f34d0611a21439" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Faphbr.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840027_8c56652bf5947f2a21ae9df34d0a3153e4c9fbb7&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><figure name="cb1c" id="cb1c" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/e3f7fb64c582af2e2c8549d539bd6bcd?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="e3f7fb64c582af2e2c8549d539bd6bcd" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2F6cecg.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840031_bd0a661acd24451ffa2f85284031ccac352cf0b7&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><figure name="b6cd" id="b6cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/d6e049476670390721bf1ddb38057abc?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="d6e049476670390721bf1ddb38057abc" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fahpee.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840036_971ddadecfaf5da3b81e763fc8634d24143c11b5&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="8134" id="8134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What makes the Warriors such a difficult team to defend is their consistent off the ball movement and screens to free up their players.

With that being said, New York’s starters are at most marginally outperforming the bench.</p><figure name="1b4a" id="1b4a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 117px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 16.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*l54IftA2spe1-QfFIhEUIQ.png" data-width="800" data-height="134" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*l54IftA2spe1-QfFIhEUIQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l54IftA2spe1-QfFIhEUIQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Results were tabled on 3/26/2017</figcaption></figure><p name="15b4" id="15b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When the Knicks were on TNT last week, Shaquille O’Neal, who played in the Triangle during his years with the Lakers, was calling the game and shared a similar sentiment.

Look at the guys, when Phil put this team together, I was liking it: [Kristaps] Porzingis, Carmelo, Rose, [Joakim] Noah. I said, ‘OK, it’s going to work if they embrace the triangle. I like it.’ But again, the ball can never stop.’’</p><p name="8a60" id="8a60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The offense appears to look better because everyone is in constant motion and embracing the system.</p><figure name="b417" id="b417" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/dec09b3b3306f8e1a985c80e13d50ac7?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="dec09b3b3306f8e1a985c80e13d50ac7" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fgyz4t.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840135_80dca1d3175e767f65a86b214271b983dce4ff29&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><figure name="e274" id="e274" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/52154c91bf262b22b020171f87d69b65?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="52154c91bf262b22b020171f87d69b65" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fpkz5v.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840139_beff55969ebbcc23c375a78aeca805dda5b3f027&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="5286" id="5286" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The ball sticks to no one and players like Hernangomez and Ron Baker the Shot Maker know when and where to make the correct pass.</p><figure name="e3f2" id="e3f2" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/2418a9c681f1e743297954993d19ed55?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="2418a9c681f1e743297954993d19ed55" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fj6pv7.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840145_20de70876c8599ba9a2ae87d471b65ae53f3cfb4&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><figure name="ff74" id="ff74" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/a787d26b632585f17de7b3c239ba1980?postId=dad9bcf149a2" data-media-id="a787d26b632585f17de7b3c239ba1980" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-e1.streamable.com%2Fimage%2Fz6egx.jpg%3Ftoken%3D1491840149_68db00dc0371cafd66f242b48e4c03fde098bd9d&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="8f05" id="8f05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The bench also execute Triangle actions well.

Unfortunately, as much as I love guys like Ron Baker and Chasson Randle, their ceiling doesn’t appear to be any higher than a solid rotation player off the bench. If the Knicks can manage to develop two undrafted rookies into being the main backup guards coming off the bench on a competitive team, it would be a huge success for the team and their scouting department. New York simply needs more talent, especially young talent willing to embrace the Triangle and willing to continually improve upon their fundamentals, like passing and cutting.</p></div></div></section><section name="62fd" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="035b" id="035b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Much of the mainstream criticisms of the Triangle Offense may not be as legitimate as originally thought, yet the offensive system is far from infallible. The Triangle essentially needs the right mixture of players, the right coaching staff, and the right environment that allows players time to get acclimated to the system. The offense itself is not necessarily the issue, but rather having to be placed in an edenic environment in order for a team to reap its fruits.</p><p name="1454" id="1454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, Jackson believes that the offense is difficult for an impatient person to teach to modern athletes. As he told Mr. Klosterman, “The problem with the Triangle is that you have to teach the most basic, basic skills: Footwork. Where you stand on the floor. And if you have the kind of player who wants to attack and score every time he touches the ball, he will hurt this offense.” Comments like these is where the stigma of the offense being rigid derives.</p><p name="c641" id="c641" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order for this system to work, a team needs the right type of players in terms of both skillset and willingness to buy into the structure of the Triangle. Porzingis may be willing to accept it, Hernangomez may have the necessary skillset to thrive in it, and Randle may have played in it during his college career, but when Anthony is not buying into it and Rose doesn’t have the basketball IQ to grasp it, should the Knicks even be trying to implement the Triangle in the first place? If players are having difficulty understanding its concepts, do the Knicks have both the right players to execute it and the right coaching staff in place in order to teach the Triangle? If learning the Triangle takes time and relies on players knowing all of the potential actions as well as teammate tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses, does Jackson and the front office consistently turning over the Knicks roster help encourage this? These questions and issues are all legitimate concerns surrounding the organization.</p><p name="049b" id="049b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Phil Jackson wanting to the Knicks to run the Triangle in and of itself isn’t a problem; running the offense played a part in winning 11 championships. The Knicks having larger systematic and roster issues is what is preventing them from being a competitive playoff team, not the offense. Jackson inherited a roster that should have been blown up before the 2013–14 trade deadline, as the team was wildly underperforming after winning 54 games in the previous season, Carmelo Anthony becoming a free agent during that 2014 offseason, and down two 1st round draft picks over the ensuing three drafts. He was offered far too much money for a position he was not qualified to have and was tasked to clean up years of gross incompetence. How can anyone legitimately expect Jackson to “fix the Knicks” by year three?</p><p name="0d84" id="0d84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that being said, Jackson has not made easy on himself in the slightest. Many of his decisions have prevented the Knicks from both truly initiating a true rebuild, such has not being able to secure a deal with Steve Kerr to be the team’s head coach, underwhelming trades like the Tyson Chandler trade, and everything related to Derrick Fisher. And when the Knicks entered this past offseason with a new head coach in Jeff Hornacek, a good rookie season from Kristaps Porzingis, and being in position to maintain roster continuity, Jackson decided to take a gamble on a contract-season Derrick Rose and signing Joakim Noah and Courtney Lee to long term deals in what can only be understood as a calculated risk to allow Porzingis to develop on a playoff team.</p><p name="2520" id="2520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This offseason gamble clearly backfired, and if you were to find just one silver lining from this season, it is that the failures on the court and of this past offseason reinforce the notion of committing to a rebuild around Porzingis and the Triangle. As awful as Noah’s contract is, it does not hamstring the Knicks cap, especially if they commit to bringing in young players to run the Triangle. Rose is a free agent this summer, let him walk. And instead of being petty by subtweeting Anthony, Jackson needs to actually sit down with Carmelo to discuss the future of the organization and potentially finding him a trade that will make him waive his no-trade clause.</p><p name="9149" id="9149" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Being in position to secure a <a href="http://www.tankathon.com/" data-href="http://www.tankathon.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Top-5 draft pick</a>, financial flexibility, and a potential franchise player willing to set the tone and embrace the Triangle offense, Phil Jackson and the New York Knicks are in a position to Jackson’s vision into a reality. “In the end, the Triangle concepts are just basketball,” Kerr told Mr. Eberhardt.. “Run, cut, spacing, dribble hand-offs. Lots of ball movement and player movement. With the right talent, those concepts are always going to give you a chance at success.” More than anything else, New York simply does not have the talent on the roster nor their players collectively buying into the Triangle. Without this, arguably the most successful offensive system the NBA has ever seen has no legitimate chance of ever finding that same success again.</p></div></div></section></div><footer

The defense can shift over to Melo making his driving lanes impossible and limiting his passes to potentially open teammates.” Anthony is 3rd in the league in isolation frequency, per NBA.com, and despite putting up a respectable 0.99 point per possession on those isolation possessions, the lack of ball movement is doing more harm to the overall offense and success of the team.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":500,"end":507,"href":"http://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/#!?sort=Time&dir=1&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=Poss*GE*3:PossG*GE*3","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"8684","type":1,"text":"The issues with the Triangle are not solely on Carmelo Anthony and his isolation, as the offense is specifically running isolation for Anthony on a number of possessions.

If the Knicks can manage to develop two undrafted rookies into being the main backup guards coming off the bench on a competitive team, it would be a huge success for the team and their scouting department.

If players are having difficulty understanding its concepts, do the Knicks have both the right players to execute it and the right coaching staff in place in order to teach the Triangle?

The Knicks having larger systematic and roster issues is what is preventing them from being a competitive playoff team, not the offense. Jackson inherited a roster that should have been blown up before the 2013–14 trade deadline, as the team was wildly underperforming after winning 54 games in the previous season, Carmelo Anthony becoming a free agent during that 2014 offseason, and down two 1st round draft picks over the ensuing three drafts.

How can anyone legitimately expect Jackson to “fix the Knicks” by year three?","markups":[]},{"name":"0d84","type":1,"text":"With that being said, Jackson has not made easy on himself in the slightest. Many of his decisions have prevented the Knicks from both truly initiating a true rebuild, such has not being able to secure a deal with Steve Kerr to be the team’s head coach, underwhelming trades like the Tyson Chandler trade, and everything related to Derrick Fisher. And when the Knicks entered this past offseason with a new head coach in Jeff Hornacek, a good rookie season from Kristaps Porzingis, and being in position to maintain roster continuity, Jackson decided to take a gamble on a contract-season Derrick Rose and signing Joakim Noah and Courtney Lee to long term deals in what can only be understood as a calculated risk to allow Porzingis to develop on a playoff team.","markups":[]},{"name":"2520","type":1,"text":"This offseason gamble clearly backfired, and if you were to find just one silver lining from this season, it is that the failures on the court and of this past offseason reinforce the notion of committing to a rebuild around Porzingis and the Triangle. As awful as Noah’s contract is, it does not hamstring the Knicks cap, especially if they commit to bringing in young players to run the Triangle. Rose is a free agent this summer, let him walk. And instead of being petty by subtweeting Anthony, Jackson needs to actually sit down with Carmelo to discuss the future of the organization and potentially finding him a trade that will make him waive his no-trade clause.","markups":[]},{"name":"9149","type":1,"text":"Being in position to secure a Top-5 draft pick, financial flexibility, and a potential franchise player willing to set the tone and embrace the Triangle offense, Phil Jackson and the New York Knicks are in a position to Jackson’s vision into a reality. “In the end, the Triangle concepts are just basketball,” Kerr told Mr. Eberhardt.. “Run, cut, spacing, dribble hand-offs. Lots of ball movement and player movement. With the right talent, those concepts are always going to give you a chance at success.” More than anything else, New York simply does not have the talent on the roster nor their players collectively buying into the Triangle. Without this, arguably the most successful offensive system the NBA has ever seen has no legitimate chance of ever finding that same success
