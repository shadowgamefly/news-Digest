markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, which was picked up by some online media outlets, we revealed Tarantool IIoT, a platform for the Industrial Internet of Things. But it seemed to remain unclear as to what exactly Tarantool IIoT is and how it works. This article aims to bridge this information gap.</p><h3 name="71e4" id="71e4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What exactly is IIoT?</h3><p name="57d1" id="57d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As a refresher, IIoT stands for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Industrial Internet of Things</em>. It’s a concept whereby industrial facilities have access to the Internet and Internet services running in data centers. Let’s take a look at this image:</p><figure name="22ec" id="22ec" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*FxFMmnvqlYpv0yvE." data-width="850" data-height="478" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*FxFMmnvqlYpv0yvE." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FxFMmnvqlYpv0yvE."></div></figure><p name="7120" id="7120" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As you can see, the image is divided into two parts: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Center </em>and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the site</em>.</p><p name="a324" id="a324" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Center</em> is either a data center or the cloud, which is any cloud IaaS solution providing the whole IT infrastructure: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, just to name a few.</p><p name="71da" id="71da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the site</em> is a broad term that includes, among other things: agricultural fields, industrial facilities (metal-working, mining, oil and gas plants and factories), repair bays, transport (automobiles, trucks, boxcars, locomotives), urban infrastructure assets (utility meters, sewers, streets, outdoor lighting), intercity communications (highways, railways, power lines). In short, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on the site</em> is all the places that have only recently been reached by the Internet. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">In the field</em> was also considered as an umbrella term, but it seems ambiguous and may narrow down the IIoT scope to agricultural fields alone.</p><h3 name="a80c" id="a80c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What’s Tarantool IIoT? What problems does it solve?</h3><p name="1fc0" id="1fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Tarantool IIoT is a distributed software platform for gathering data from sensors and sending it to data centers and local control systems. Tarantool IIoT works both in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">center </em>and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on the site</em>, tying them into a unified information network. In this network, most of the logic is moved to the software level. It means that, in terms of hardware, it can be built with commodity components and doesn’t need any special vendors of closed-source, proprietary software and hardware suites. Has it become any clearer now? If not, read on =)</p><p name="a3d4" id="a3d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Commodity components are cheap and easily replaceable. If you think of a data center, commodity components are inexpensive servers (say, Supermicro or those assembled piecewise). In terms of on-site hardware, it can be the cheapest sensors and IoT hubs (ARM- or MIPS-powered minicomputers).</p><p name="008c" id="008c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We at <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/en/company/portal/" data-href="https://corp.mail.ru/en/company/portal/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mail.Ru Group</a> switched to using commodity hardware for our data centers a long time ago. We enjoy low prices and interchangeability at the expense of occasionally not having warranty and support that go with a particular brand. Reliability and performance are ensured on the software level: if something gets broken, it doesn’t affect our services much, since everything’s duplicated and replicated — we simply have the broken hardware repaired. Neither turnaround time nor whether it’s possible to fix an item influences business continuity. That’s the path large American IT corporations have long since taken: all the complexity is moved to the software level, and hardware becomes as generic and cheap as possible. And now we suggest taking the same approach to the IoT ecosystem.</p><p name="6b89" id="6b89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might be wondering why it’s necessary to combine the center and sites into a unified information network. Here are a couple of reasons for that:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="a15a" id="a15a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Sites have various sources of information (temperature, vibration, position, moisture, voltage, pressure, and so on). This wealth of data should be gathered, aggregated and sent to the center for further analysis, which allows identifying faults in the production process, quantifying losses, fuel and resource consumption, operational efficiency, service time and probability of equipment failure.</li><li name="0249" id="0249" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sites have the infrastructure that can sometimes be easily managed from the center, especially based on the insights previously gained from the gathered data. Managing here means sending some commands (calling the API) from the data center to the sites — these commands activate (turn on/off, diminish, enlarge, slow down, speed up) local objects. I think it’s too premature to be talking about fully controlling all the processes from the center (after all, nobody wants a 15-ton press to fall down just because of a glitchy network connection). However, lots of more mundane tasks can be managed this way. For example, if the readings coming from vibration sensors installed on a piece of equipment indicate it’s about to break down, the center may send a command to the plant that will light up a red flickering light bulb (if an event alert is simply pushed to the responsible worker’s tablet, it may be overlooked). Once the worker sees the red flicker, they will stop the equipment and take it for maintenance ahead of time.</li></ol><p name="49d3" id="49d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">As you might expect, working with sites is associated with some specific challenges that are different from those you face when running a data center. Let me say this right away: we at Mail.Ru Group are just beginning to shape our IIoT strategy and to probe the IIoT market and may not fully understand all the nuances. Here’s our take on what it’s like to work with sites:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e70e" id="e70e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">huge areas (take an average-sized plant — it can be hundreds of times larger than even a big data center);</li><li name="6f42" id="6f42" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">adverse weather conditions (heat, cold, moisture);</li><li name="90da" id="90da" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">increased risk of damaging IT infrastructure facilities;</li><li name="3420" id="3420" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">high cost of replacing IT infrastructure assets (getting to a distant field given impassable roads and then driving another hundred square kilometers through and around the field itself is not the same as dropping in a nearby data center);</li><li name="fe5c" id="fe5c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">external (in relation to the IT infrastructure) data that needs to be collected with temperature, moisture, density, position, weight and voltage sensors.</li></ul><p name="0910" id="0910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">What it means is that in factories, fields and city streets, on ships and at other facilities, we can’t build what we usually build in data centers: rows upon rows of racks with similar servers interlinked with switches via optical fiber. That would be insanely expensive.</p><p name="6ce7" id="6ce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What can’t we do just yet? In the IoT world, servers are replaced by IoT hubs — microcomputers (industrial counterparts of Raspberry Pi) scattered across vast site areas. Connecting them with optical fiber is expensive, same as arranging them in racks, because, due to large distances, IoT hubs are too numerous, and financially strained businesses can’t afford to form local clusters consisting of multiple IoT hubs. So there are no isolated racks, with lots of hardware all over the place. Furthermore, businesses have millions of sensors (I mentioned a few types earlier in the article) placed here and there from which IoT hubs gather data. But how do they gather it? If sensors aren’t that numerous, data can be transmitted across wires. Otherwise, if we’re talking about a million devices, radio channels are used (a million wires, one for each sensor, — can you imagine what a mess it’s going to be?).</p><p name="f8ab" id="f8ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, for the solution to be more or less cost-effective, the overall setup might look something like this:</p><figure name="f8f3" id="f8f3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*VKqSCZMi5ZW0s2LW." data-width="850" data-height="478" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*VKqSCZMi5ZW0s2LW." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VKqSCZMi5ZW0s2LW."></div></figure><p name="973c" id="973c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sensors collect data and send it to hubs (these aren’t network hubs, they just happen to have the same name; these are microcomputers with a small motherboard, CPU, RAM and OS) that, in their turn, send it over the Internet (by means of mobile telephony, Wi-Fi, satellite channels, Ethernet and so on) to a data center. Data travels back the same way it came: from a data center over a hub to a sensor (or a local programmable logic controller).</p><p name="fe82" id="fe82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moving on. Do you still remember the challenges peculiar to the IIoT ecosystem that we discussed earlier in the article? To avoid exorbitant costs of the whole setup, the following should be true:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="57ae" id="57ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">IoT hubs are comprised of easily replaceable components to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in and lower the cost of hardware, which you need a lot of due to large areas;</li><li name="d0d8" id="d0d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">an open-source OS is used (for example, Linux-based OpenWrt);</li><li name="0b13" id="0b13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">all the logic describing interactions with any type of sensors and their protocols is moved to the software level (not to depend on expensive branded black-box solutions);</li><li name="ac63" id="ac63" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">the logic defining how signals sent to sensors and equipment are processed is implemented at the level of software running on IoT hubs, instead of being hard-coded in a vendor’s hardware;</li><li name="7a1e" id="7a1e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">software installed on IoT hubs works really fast. IoT hubs themselves are slow, and they’re slow, because they’re cheap; and they’re cheap, because you need quite a few of them; and you need quite a few because of the challenges associated with the IIoT (discussed earlier). Also, don’t forget about adverse weather conditions (heat, cold, moisture, vibration), which means these IoT hubs need special casing. But you can’t afford any additional expenses, and it leaves you with only one option: buy even cheaper — and, as a result, slower — hardware. Just imagine how fast the software must be to make up for it!</li></ul><p name="0a1d" id="0a1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In other words, it would be nice to have the same things that we normally have in data centers: cheap commodity hardware and all the logic and fault-tolerance on the software level.</p><p name="603c" id="603c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s now turn to software installed in a data center. Apart from some OS, there are many other components used: DBMSs, application servers, monitoring systems and DevOps scripts and systems. On top of this infrastructure, some business logic is implemented. Ideally, the whole infrastructure is configured in such a way that it can automatically (or at least semi-automatically) handle most hardware failures (to failover to a slave when the master is down, balance the workload across several application server nodes, make sure a new cluster member is in ready state and so on).</p><p name="9ad8" id="9ad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We see several specializations emerge. Business logic developers (product developers) usually focus on, well, the business logic and solving business-related problems. Then there are other engineers dealing with a huge underwater part of the iceberg: DevOps, system administrators, developers of DBMSs, application servers, monitoring systems and other infrastructure components.</p><p name="bb68" id="bb68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine if the process of development for IoT hubs was similarly specialized. How cool would that be?</p><h3 name="f78f" id="f78f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Tarantool IIoT under the hood</h3><p name="7af5" id="7af5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Which brings us to Tarantool IIoT. I’m not saying it’s going to substitute the whole IoT hub infrastructure, but it can do so at least partly. Take a look at the following image:</p><figure name="ced9" id="ced9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*HClSGwfk_H5QRpgI." data-width="850" data-height="478" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*HClSGwfk_H5QRpgI." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HClSGwfk_H5QRpgI."></div></figure><p name="d6c7" id="d6c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Tarantool IIoT is just a regular Tarantool built and tested on the ARM and x86 architectures (MIPS version is currently in production). Besides, it boasts built-in support for MQTT and MRAA, main protocols for working with sensors. Tarantool IIoT is installed directly on IoT hubs. To transfer data between sensors and a hub, special LoRa or 6LoWPAN equipment is needed. You might think it’s bad (remember, we don’t want unique proprietary hardware), but the thing is this equipment doesn’t necessarily support multiple sensor protocols. Its only purpose is to wrap a given protocol into something a hub can understand (usually it’s good old TCP/IP). Tarantool IIoT takes care of all the other processing with scripts running directly on an IoT hub.</p><p name="ff7c" id="ff7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where a software platform beats a hardware one: you don’t need vendors to support any protocols and equipment. If you’d like to know more technical details, check the article called <a href="https://hackernoon.com/master-master-replication-and-scaling-of-an-application-between-each-of-the-iot-devices-and-the-69c286f1b0d3#.a0l7nd7sd" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/master-master-replication-and-scaling-of-an-application-between-each-of-the-iot-devices-and-the-69c286f1b0d3#.a0l7nd7sd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Master-Master Replication and Scaling of an Application between Each of the IoT Devices and the Cloud</em></a>.</p><p name="4275" id="4275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apart from what we’ve already discussed, Tarantool IIoT is a full-blown Tarantool, that is an all-in-one DBMS and application server with a transaction log, inter-node replication, two engines (memtx, in-memory, and vinyl, on-disk), stored procedures, asynchronous jobs, support for queues and other handy stuff.</p><h3 name="3d22" id="3d22" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What’s in it for a developer?</h3><p name="0ea5" id="0ea5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As I mentioned, Tarantool IIoT is installed directly on IoT hubs. What does it mean for a developer?</p><ol class="postList"><li name="d85a" id="d85a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Tarantool IIoT can be used for writing scripts that receive sensor data, parse it and store it in a local database inside Tarantool IIoT itself (it’s persisted to an IoT hub’s flash memory).</li><li name="cfca" id="cfca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Information stored on an IoT hub is locally replicated between several hubs for the sake of security (to ensure the system is still functional after one or more hubs are down). Tarantool has out-of-the-box replication, so you don’t have to implement a custom queue system. One thing to note here is that Tarantool isn’t just an application server, but also a DBMS, which means it can persist and replicate data between nodes — crucial features in the context of what I wrote above. What’s even more important is that it works out of the box and has been time-tested (Tarantool core is the same as for regular, non-IoT services).</li><li name="05d0" id="05d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Information stored on IoT hubs is replicated to the data center via Tarantool’s built-in mechanisms. You can replicate whatever part or aggregation of it — this setting is programmable and works directly on an IoT hub.</li><li name="d025" id="d025" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It’s possible to automatically upload code and stored procedures to on-site Tarantool instances. In other words, you can change the local aggregation logic directly from the data center (or any place you can access the data center: office or home over the VPN) without visiting the field.</li><li name="19d8" id="19d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">With just a single command issued from the data center (and from the web interface accessible by authorized people from anywhere around the world), you can specify how detailed the data sent to the data center should be; locally, you’ll still be able to gather as much information as needed and process it without forwarding it to the data center.</li></ol><p name="5789" id="5789" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">As a result, product developers get one step closer to that degree of convenience which is associated with creating normal software for Internet services. They don’t have to worry about channels between IoT hubs or between a hub and the data center being insecure or prone to failure: with replication in place, data gets delivered both ways without any loss or duplication. Developers don’t have to spend too much time on a client-server architecture, file handling, data loss, hubs being down — Tarantool IIoT takes care of it all the same way as regular Tarantool does in the data center. It means developers can focus on the business logic instead.</p><p name="1124" id="1124" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d like to add here that data delivery is handled by the built-in inter-node <a href="https://tarantool.org/doc/book/replication/index.html" data-href="https://tarantool.org/doc/book/replication/index.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">replication mechanism</a> that has been used inside Tarantool for the past nine years. That is to say it’s quite robust and stable.</p><p name="2d3b" id="2d3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially, Tarantool IIoT is a fully programmable open-source platform that allows not only developing applications for local IIoT devices (without visiting the site!), but also applying best data center practices to on-site IoT devices.</p><p name="eaa3" id="eaa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, this platform lets you off the leash in the same sense that hardware vendors keep you on it. Suppose you have an up-and-running IoT hardware infrastructure that automatically delivers all the sensor data gathered to the data center. Once you buy a new batch of cheaper sensors that aren’t supported by your equipment, you’ll have to beg at the vendor’s feet to make necessary changes to its hardware, which will cost you an arm and a leg. Another option would be just to buy new equipment or discard the cheap incompatible sensors. All of these are hardware changes associated with certain downtime, visiting the site, installing new hardware and other troubles.</p><p name="23b8" id="23b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With Tarantool IIoT, you can easily receive data from these new cheaper sensors, parse it and then pass it on to your equipment or local software in a required format. No downtime or heavy spending involved.</p><p name="19f8" id="19f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It goes without saying that Tarantool IIoT alone isn’t enough. To feel fully at ease, you need other infrastructure components in place: monitoring, software update (don’t forget Tarantool needs to be updated), automatic Linux installation and so on. But it seems an important step in the right direction.</p><h3 name="5a06" id="5a06" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Tarantool IIoT and not $any_other_iiot_solution?</h3><p name="4a2e" id="4a2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’d like to conclude this article by explaining why we picked Tarantool to power our IIoT product. Let’s get back to what challenges IoT hubs present: on the one hand, these devices have slow CPUs with few cores (usually up to 2), little RAM and flash memory, the latter, to cap it all, being slow and insecure. Why’s that? Devices must be dirt cheap (about $30–100), because they’re so numerous, because they’re scattered across a large area and because of some other things I discussed above. You just have to deal with it! On the other hand, sensors generate a huge amount of data (each sensor can send tens and hundreds of readings per second, with one hub communicating with hundreds and even thousands of sensors). All the incoming data needs to be processed regardless of harsh conditions and not-so-fast hardware.</p><p name="3be2" id="3be2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Therefore, such devices call for really fast software, a really fast DBMS and a really fast application server capable of running on a single CPU core, as memory-efficient as possible and not putting too much strain on the disk.</p><p name="b927" id="b927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given all these constraints, Tarantool demonstrated the best performance on our tests. The runner-up in terms of speed is Redis (unfortunately, CouchBase and Aerospike fared poorly: they’re too slow on single-core machines, but maybe we just haven’t fine-tuned them enough). From the IoT standpoint, Redis has a few major disadvantages: its application server doesn’t have enough functionality, there are no stored procedures (also, you can’t update any code inside the DBMS at runtime), no jobs, no master-master replication and no transactions; therefore, you’re running a higher risk of losing your data. Also, it’s not clear if the developers are planning to take their product in this direction. This <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tarantool-vs-redis-38a4041cc4bc#.7h2lroqin" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/tarantool-vs-redis-38a4041cc4bc#.7h2lroqin" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">article</a> covers Tarantool vs Redis in more detail. The Python + Redis bundle can, in a sense, substitute for Tarantool, but it will likely be much slower. Let me say this up front, though: we haven’t benchmarked Tarantool against this bundle yet. Moreover, we recommend that the speed be compared on a case-by-case basis.</p><p name="6b9e" id="6b9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another important thing to keep in mind: on IoT devices, when a DBMS and an application server are combined (which is the case with Tarantool), the associated communication costs are obviously much lower (for more information on overhead costs, which are huge even in fast DBMSs, check this article: <a href="https://medium.com/@denisanikin/asynchronous-processing-with-in-memory-databases-or-how-to-handle-one-million-transactions-per-36a4c01fc4e4#.ftvh7thvd" data-href="https://medium.com/@denisanikin/asynchronous-processing-with-in-memory-databases-or-how-to-handle-one-million-transactions-per-36a4c01fc4e4#.ftvh7thvd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Asynchronous processing with in-memory databases or how to handle one million transactions per second on a single CPU core</a>). That said, any overhead costs related to data exchange between different processes are significant because of poor performance of IoT devices and massive amounts of data that needs to be processed.</p><p name="a390" id="a390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a little nifty DBMS called SQLite — it’s performant and fast, but, unfortunately, doesn’t have replication and an out-of-the-box application server, which means you have to implement the missing components yourself. The rest of traditional DBMSs (I won’t mention any names here, but it’s a long list of respectable and well-known products) just wouldn’t work as expected on our small IoT devices and were totally unable to withstand the workload generated by the sensors. However, if you have any first-hand experience using other DBMSs on IoT devices, we’d be happy to hear from you in the comments below!</p><p name="676f" id="676f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">That’s all I wanted to tell you about Tarantool IIoT. We’re working on several pilot projects for some manufacturing, transport and other companies. Once any of them is deployed to production, we’ll share a detailed story with you. Stay tuned!</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="u-paddingTop10"><div class="container u-maxWidth740"><div class="row"><div class="col u-size12of12"></div></div><div class="row"><div

Neither turnaround time nor whether it’s possible to fix an item influences business continuity.

Managing here means sending some commands (calling the API) from the data center to the sites — these commands activate (turn on/off, diminish, enlarge, slow down, speed up) local objects. I think it’s too premature to be talking about fully controlling all the processes from the center (after all, nobody wants a 15-ton press to fall down just because of a glitchy network connection). However, lots of more mundane tasks can be managed this way. For example, if the readings coming from vibration sensors installed on a piece of equipment indicate it’s about to break down, the center may send a command to the plant that will light up a red flickering light bulb (if an event alert is simply pushed to the responsible worker’s tablet, it may be overlooked).

So there are no isolated racks, with lots of hardware all over the place. Furthermore, businesses have millions of sensors (I mentioned a few types earlier in the article) placed here and there from which IoT hubs gather data. But how do they gather it? If sensors aren’t that numerous, data can be transmitted across wires.

Also, don’t forget about adverse weather conditions (heat, cold, moisture, vibration), which means these IoT hubs need special casing.

It means developers can focus on the business logic instead.","markups":[]},{"name":"1124","type":1,"text":"I’d like to add here that data delivery is handled by the built-in inter-node replication mechanism that has been used inside Tarantool for the past nine years.

Suppose you have an up-and-running IoT hardware infrastructure that automatically delivers all the sensor data gathered to the data center. Once you buy a new batch of cheaper sensors that aren’t supported by your equipment, you’ll have to beg at the vendor’s feet to make necessary changes to its hardware, which will cost you an arm and a leg. Another option would be just to buy new equipment or discard the cheap incompatible sensors. All of these are hardware changes associated with certain downtime, visiting the site, installing new hardware and other troubles.","markups":[]},{"name":"23b8","type":1,"text":"With Tarantool IIoT, you can easily receive data from these new cheaper sensors, parse it and then pass it on to your equipment or local software in a required format.

Let’s get back to what challenges IoT hubs present: on the one hand, these devices have slow CPUs with few cores (usually up to 2), little RAM and flash memory, the latter, to cap it all, being slow and insecure. Why’s that? Devices must be dirt cheap (about $30–100), because they’re so numerous, because they’re scattered across a large area and because of some other things I discussed above. You just have to deal with it! On the other hand, sensors generate a huge amount of data (each sensor can send tens and hundreds of readings per second, with one hub communicating with hundreds and even thousands of sensors). All the incoming data needs to be processed regardless of harsh conditions and not-so-fast hardware.","markups":[]},{"name":"3be2","type":1,"text":"Therefore, such devices call for really fast software, a really fast DBMS and a really fast application server capable of running on a single CPU core, as memory-efficient as possible and not putting too much strain on the disk.","markups":[]},{"name":"b927","type":1,"text":"Given all these constraints, Tarantool demonstrated the best performance on our tests. The runner-up in terms of speed is Redis (unfortunately, CouchBase and Aerospike fared poorly: they’re too slow on single-core machines, but maybe we just haven’t fine-tuned them enough). From the IoT standpoint, Redis has a few major disadvantages: its application server doesn’t have enough functionality, there are no stored procedures (also, you can’t update any code inside the DBMS at runtime), no jobs, no master-master replication and no transactions; therefore, you’re running a higher risk of losing your data. Also, it’s not clear if the developers are planning to take their product in this direction. This article covers Tarantool vs Redis in more detail. The Python + Redis bundle can, in a sense, substitute for Tarantool, but it will likely be much slower. Let me say this up front, though: we haven’t benchmarked Tarantool against this bundle yet. Moreover, we recommend that the speed be compared on a case-by-case basis.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":706,"end":713,"href":"https://hackernoon.com/tarantool-vs-redis-38a4041cc4bc#.7h2lroqin","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"6b9e","type":1,"text":"Another important thing to keep in mind: on IoT devices, when a DBMS and an application server are combined (which is the case with Tarantool), the associated communication costs are obviously much lower (for more information on overhead costs, which are huge even in fast DBMSs, check this article: Asynchronous processing with in-memory databases or how to handle one million transactions per second on a single CPU core).
