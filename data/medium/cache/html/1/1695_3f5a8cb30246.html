To put that number in perspective, the average soccer player in the United States’ MLS made a relatively paltry $310,000 (according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sports-leagues-top-salaries-2015-5" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sports-leagues-top-salaries-2015-5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>).

One that even mainstream sports fans are being forced to acknowledge.</p><p name="6c17" id="6c17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anybody who has regularly checked ESPN.com over the past 2 years likely noticed the network’s prominent coverage of The International, the most popular gaming tournament in the world. That coverage was more than a media giant gauging the potential of a new upstart. In 2014, the year that ESPN began covering the event, <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/instantawesome-leagueoflegends-141201/league-legends-championships-watched-more-people-nba-finals-world-series-clinchers" data-href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/instantawesome-leagueoflegends-141201/league-legends-championships-watched-more-people-nba-finals-world-series-clinchers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more than 27 million people</a> tuned in to watch the finals being streamed from Seoul, Korea. That number was actually lower than the tournament’s 2013 audience, but still significantly higher than the final game of the MLB World Series (23.5 million) and NBA finals (18 million) from the same year. While the network only gave the tournament a brief feature on live TV, viewers still flocked to watch the tournament on ESPN3, the company’s streaming site.</p><figure name="23d9" id="23d9" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 328px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OCKr1FpXKzNTlCrKm4FinQ.jpeg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*OCKr1FpXKzNTlCrKm4FinQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*OCKr1FpXKzNTlCrKm4FinQ.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="91e5" id="91e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">That attention took another step forward last April, when ESPN2 covered the collegiate tournament for Heroes of the Storm (cleverly named Heroes of the Dorm). As the first live-TV broadcast for eSports in the US, this was, at least symbolically, a huge step forward for professional gaming; one that helped to expose and legitimize the industry before a more mainstream audience. (Even if ESPN failed to stream the finals while they were being shown on TV, excluding a lot of the fans that professional gaming already had.)</p><p name="a94f" id="a94f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Looking beyond the milestone of live TV, however, it’s easy to see the potential for eSports to become a more popular (perhaps even commonplace) part of the sports entertainment landscape.</p><p name="07cb" id="07cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Heroes of the Storm technical designer John Hodgson <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/heroes-of-the-dorm-finals-were-a-success-story-for-esports/" data-href="http://www.pcgamer.com/heroes-of-the-dorm-finals-were-a-success-story-for-esports/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">told PC Gamer</a>, “It certainly helps to have something recognizable. If you’re going to put something on TV and say ‘this is Team Liquid versus Cloud Nine’, people don’t really know who those people are, but people know who Berkeley is. That’s a college.”</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="9137" id="9137" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 978px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 97.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pqQdLHEZWK73RK_NNA8mKQ.jpeg" data-width="1104" data-height="1080" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*pqQdLHEZWK73RK_NNA8mKQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*pqQdLHEZWK73RK_NNA8mKQ.jpeg"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3e94" id="3e94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The popularity of college sports in the United States is a phenomenon not seen anywhere else in the world. Each university has its own incredibly devoted fan-base that will cheer the school on regardless of the sport. Even though eSports differ in nature from just about any physical sport, it’s hard to believe that the latent support that accompanies college-affiliation would not carry over, should efforts be made to organize professional gaming.</p><p name="70ce" id="70ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If eSports were to form a central organization, similar to the NCAA, it’s hard to see how the arrangement wouldn’t benefit both sides. In addition to more attention for professional gaming as a whole, the individual players involved could benefit from scholarships and other programs typically reserved for athletes. These new athletes would also receive the individual prestige that comes with being an athlete on a college campus (even one who competes sitting in front of a computer). Those benefits would go a long way to improve the quality of play and make competitive gamers more likely to continue pursuing their passion, instead of bowing out due to social pressure.</p><p name="39fc" id="39fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chance to gain an education while competing could also be a strong motivator for a lot of players, perhaps even more so in gaming than in other sports, because the performance window is so small. Athletes in most of the major American sports peak physically at around 27–28 years old. For professional gamers, that peak is closer to 24 years old, meaning that the window to compete (and make money) like an elite player is much smaller, at least until public awareness and acceptance help push that number back. Even for players who aren’t elite, though, having a skill that will help them get into college and an organization that could allow them to make money while still in college, would be a godsend.</p><p name="f143" id="f143" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surprisingly (to me at least), the idea of college scholarships for eSports isn’t a novel one. In May of this year, <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/05/28/college-esports-scholarships/" data-href="http://fortune.com/2015/05/28/college-esports-scholarships/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fortune published an article reporting</a> that Robert Morris University (Illinois) and the University of Pikeville had both formed university-sponsored League of Legends teams <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">with scholarships</em>. From the large number of teams who participated in the Heroes of the Dorm tournament, it’s obvious that a large number of schools have teams, but none of those groups had ever been considered anything more than a club by their respective universities. When Robert Morris announced the creation of the team last year, the associate athletic director in charge of the program received more than 2,000 emails from interested students and prospective students. Robert Morris has around 3,200 students total. The university also had inquiries from 35 other schools wanting to know how Robert Morris had built and organized their program.</p><figure name="494d" id="494d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 388px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 55.50000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0nDUZelAPlOYf52K2f2_TQ.jpeg" data-width="885" data-height="491" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*0nDUZelAPlOYf52K2f2_TQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0nDUZelAPlOYf52K2f2_TQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by Andrew Rush</figcaption></figure><p name="5e0d" id="5e0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Robert Morris is a small, private university located in Chicago. It technically isn’t even the most famous Robert Morris University. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">That</em> Robert Morris (the one that occasionally shows up as a 15 or 16 seed on your March Madness bracket) is in Pennsylvania. Despite that, Robert Morris’ decision had a significant impact that rippled out to other universities (UPike was one of the schools that approached Robert Morris about their new team).</p><p name="3a9f" id="3a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard to predict how sizable an impact a large state school could make by following in Robert Morris’ footsteps, but it’s also hard to see what the universities have to lose. Professional gaming attracts an audience that is different from traditional sports fans, insofar as eSports fans are perfectly happy to watch the sport on their computers. This would be completely new territory.</p><p name="a144" id="a144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of professional gaming’s popularity boom in recent years has had to do with access to streaming. Twitch.tv, a video game streaming company purchased by Amazon for $1 billion last year, was launched in 2011 and is already drawing in more than 100 million viewers a month, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/01/29/twitchs-viewers-reach-100-million-a-month/" data-href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/01/29/twitchs-viewers-reach-100-million-a-month/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>. It’s also the fourth largest source of internet traffic, trailing household names: Netflix, Google, and Apple. Almost all major sports in the United States are making forays into streaming online, but none have managed to generated the popularity that gaming espouses. Whereas it would be difficult to find airtime or viewers, for, say, a football practice, gaming practices can drum up solid viewership online, without approaching the expenses of television. That large amount of online media exposure for the teams would also mean a large amount of exposure for whatever universities and sponsors are connected to those teams.</p><p name="fcb6" id="fcb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That exposure could have an impact that goes beyond just revenue. Given the global nature of eSports interest, there is a good chance that American institutions could receive international recognition that would normally be inconceivable. With the exception of soccer (maybe), there is no sport that can draw viewers from all over the planet like professional gaming. Even soccer’s popularity, however, is divided up among countries and individual leagues. With eSports, though, the fan-base is nowhere near as established, and a strong league with good competition could draw fans from all across the world. Almost all US colleges are not well known once a border is crossed- let alone an ocean- but it’s not beyond the scope of imagination that, with a proper league, teenagers from Korea could be cheering for the University of Texas at The International.</p><p name="698c" id="698c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the amount of money being passed around (The International gave out $18 million in prizes this year), it’s puzzling that more colleges haven’t adopted eSports already. It’s entirely possible that most college administrations simply don’t know about the large, but still relatively niche world of professional gaming, and the potential that exists within the sport. However, it’s also possible that universities are turned off by the thought that having eSports “athletes” could damage the perception (both externally and internally) of their traditional athletes and programs. Or, maybe they are hesitant to get involved in a sport with an overwhelmingly male player- and fan-base. Those biases and discrepancies, however, could likely be eroded away as professional gaming steps further into the limelight of national attention.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3ed9" id="3ed9" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 563px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ukxgwcNpvgNBHdo4fU_1uA.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*ukxgwcNpvgNBHdo4fU_1uA.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ukxgwcNpvgNBHdo4fU_1uA.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4d77" id="4d77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Professional gaming is still trying to find its place in the public consciousness, but it’s impossible to call video games themselves a niche hobby anymore. Almost everyone has a video game in their pocket wherever they go, and mobile games are the gateway drug to more serious games. The most popular game today, League of Legends, was drawing more than 27 million players a day when developer Riot Games <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/27/5350944/league-of-legends-has-27-million-daily-active-players" data-href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/27/5350944/league-of-legends-has-27-million-daily-active-players" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">last published</a> player numbers. 67 million were logging in on a monthly basis. Given that 60% of those players “are enrolled in or have completed some college,” <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/15/riot-games-releases-awesome-league-of-legends-infographic" data-href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/15/riot-games-releases-awesome-league-of-legends-infographic" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to a 2012 release</a>, it only makes sense for a university to let its students waste time productively.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="u-paddingTop10"><div class="container

Each university has its own incredibly devoted fan-base that will cheer the school on regardless of the sport. Even though eSports differ in nature from just about any physical sport, it’s hard to believe that the latent support that accompanies college-affiliation would not carry over, should efforts be made to organize professional gaming.","markups":[]},{"name":"70ce","type":1,"text":"If eSports were to form a central organization, similar to the NCAA, it’s hard to see how the arrangement wouldn’t benefit both sides. In addition to more attention for professional gaming as a whole, the individual players involved could benefit from scholarships and other programs typically reserved for athletes. These new athletes would also receive the individual prestige that comes with being an athlete on a college campus (even one who competes sitting in front of a computer). Those benefits would go a long way to improve the quality of play and make competitive gamers more likely to continue pursuing their passion, instead of bowing out due to social pressure.","markups":[]},{"name":"39fc","type":1,"text":"The chance to gain an education while competing could also be a strong motivator for a lot of players, perhaps even more so in gaming than in other sports, because the performance window is so small. Athletes in most of the major American sports peak physically at around 27–28 years old. For professional gamers, that peak is closer to 24 years old, meaning that the window to compete (and make money) like an elite player is much smaller, at least until public awareness and acceptance help push that number back. Even for players who aren’t elite, though, having a skill that will help them get into college and an organization that could allow them to make money while still in college, would be a godsend.","markups":[]},{"name":"f143","type":1,"text":"Surprisingly (to me at least), the idea of college scholarships for eSports isn’t a novel one. In May of this year, Fortune published an article reporting that Robert Morris University (Illinois) and the University of Pikeville had both formed university-sponsored League of Legends teams with scholarships. From the large number of teams who participated in the Heroes of the Dorm tournament, it’s obvious that a large number of schools have teams, but none of those groups had ever been considered anything more than a club by their respective universities. When Robert Morris announced the creation of the team last year, the associate athletic director in charge of the program received more than 2,000 emails from interested students and prospective students. Robert Morris has around 3,200 students total. The university also had inquiries from 35 other schools wanting to know how Robert Morris had built and organized their program.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":116,"end":154,"href":"http://fortune.com/2015/05/28/college-esports-scholarships/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":289,"end":306}]},{"name":"494d","type":4,"text":"Photo by Andrew Rush","markups":[],"layout":1,"metadata":{"id":"1*0nDUZelAPlOYf52K2f2_TQ.jpeg","originalWidth":885,"originalHeight":491}},{"name":"5e0d","type":1,"text":"Robert Morris is a small, private university located in Chicago.

This would be completely new territory.","markups":[]},{"name":"a144","type":1,"text":"Part of professional gaming’s popularity boom in recent years has had to do with access to streaming. Twitch.tv, a video game streaming company purchased by Amazon for $1 billion last year, was launched in 2011 and is already drawing in more than 100 million viewers a month, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s also the fourth largest source of internet traffic, trailing household names: Netflix, Google, and Apple. Almost all major sports in the United States are making forays into streaming online, but none have managed to generated the popularity that gaming espouses. Whereas it would be difficult to find airtime or viewers, for, say, a football practice, gaming practices can drum up solid viewership online, without approaching the expenses of television. That large amount of online media exposure for the teams would also mean a large amount of exposure for whatever universities and sponsors are connected to those teams.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":276,"end":312,"href":"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/01/29/twitchs-viewers-reach-100-million-a-month/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"fcb6","type":1,"text":"That exposure could have an impact that goes beyond just revenue. Given the global nature of eSports interest, there is a good chance that American institutions could receive international recognition that would normally be inconceivable. With the exception of soccer (maybe), there is no sport that can draw viewers from all over the planet like professional gaming. Even soccer’s popularity, however, is divided up among countries and individual leagues. With eSports, though, the fan-base is nowhere near as established, and a strong league with good competition could draw fans from all across the world. Almost all US colleges are not well known once a border is crossed- let alone an ocean- but it’s not beyond the scope of imagination that, with a proper league, teenagers from Korea could be cheering for the University of Texas at The International.","markups":[]},{"name":"698c","type":1,"text":"Given the amount of money being passed around (The International gave out $18 million in prizes this year), it’s puzzling that more colleges haven’t adopted eSports already. It’s entirely possible that most college administrations simply don’t know about the large, but still relatively niche world of professional gaming, and the potential that exists within the sport. However, it’s also possible that universities are turned off by the thought that having eSports “athletes” could damage the perception (both externally and internally) of their traditional athletes and programs. Or, maybe they are hesitant to get involved in a sport with an overwhelmingly male player- and fan-base. Those biases and discrepancies, however, could likely be eroded away as professional gaming steps further into the limelight of national attention.","markups":[]},{"name":"3ed9","type":4,"text":"","markups":[],"layout":3,"metadata":{"id":"1*ukxgwcNpvgNBHdo4fU_1uA.png","originalWidth":1920,"originalHeight":1080}},{"name":"4d77","type":1,"text":"Professional gaming is still trying to find its place in the public consciousness, but it’s impossible to call video games themselves a niche hobby anymore.
