Born in Pakistan, he moved to Burnley, England as a young child. A veteran activist of anti-racist, anti-war, human rights and global justice movements, he leads the international climate work of Friends of the Earth EWNI (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and is a board member of Friends of the Earth International and Global Justice Now!</p><p name="3f48" id="3f48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">He sat down with Daniel Voskoboynik to speak about his life story, his experience campaigning for justice, the shattering horizons we’re heading towards, and how we build the power necessary to turn the world.</p></div></div></section><section name="c10d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="73f5" id="73f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">It’s been a little over a year since the Paris Agreement, a few months since the Marrakesh Summit. We’ve just emerged from the hottest year on record, with devastating impacts seen in Central Asia, across the Horn of Africa, in the Pacific. Looking back now, how do you evaluate that landmark agreement?</em></h4><p name="7245" id="7245" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A political outcome is usually a reflection of strength: in that sense, the Paris Agreement is a reflection of the relative weakness of the climate movement, and conversely, the power of elites and the businesses of usual to protect an economic order.</p><p name="6437" id="6437" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On one level, having governments recognize the need to keep temperatures below 1.5°C was a huge step forward. It was only achieved through the concerted pressure of climate justice movements. But the widely-praised goals of the Paris Agreement are aspirational: the actual pledges of action countries have made take us somewhere between three and seven degrees Celsius, cataclysmic levels of warming.</p><p name="a569" id="a569" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, the dominant political narrative is that the goals of Paris will be met. Because 1.5°C is in the text that must mean we’re on a pathway to that, we’re on the path to decarbonising the world. The reality is we’ve won an ambition for 1.5°C, but it’s not legally binding. There is no enforcement mechanism to make sure countries live up to their promises, and we haven’t won the means to achieve it, at least not in a just way without relying on risky geo-engineering technology, or the massive land grab needed for dangerous negative emissions technology schemes like bio-energy carbon capture and storage. Keeping temperatures below 1.5°C, even 2°C, in a just way requires a transformation of how we produce and consume energy and food — a shift away from business as usual and reshaping of our economies away from neo-liberal capitalism that puts profit before people and planet. Put bluntly, international agreements are not going to save the planet, without powerful movements at national and global level to make symbolic victories real.</p><h4 name="50fe" id="50fe" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">You’ve spent a good part of the last decade working to exert pressure within the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework on Climate Change). What makes the climate crisis so difficult to solve? Why are most governments so reluctant to respond with reason to the threats we’re facing?</em></h4><p name="a7b0" id="a7b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you start from a perspective that negotiations on climate change are about the climate, or about the environment, then you don’t really understand what the negotiations are about. The climate talks and the entire debate about climate change is fundamentally about political economy. Ultimately, it’s about maintaining the dominant neo-liberal economic system, the profits of the few, and when push comes to shove, it’s about deciding who lives and who dies. It’s about determining the level of loss of lives and livelihoods in poor countries that rich countries are willing to accommodate.</p><blockquote name="658d" id="658d" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The climate talks and the entire debate about climate change is fundamentally about political economy. It’s about determining the level of loss of lives and livelihoods in poor countries that rich countries are willing to accommodate.</blockquote><p name="091c" id="091c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">So without understanding those dimensions, it becomes very difficult to comprehend why it’s so difficult to reach an international agreement on climate change, why governments aren’t responding rationally to the science. Ambitious action on climate change is elusive because powerful economic vested interests don’t want to lose their economic power and control, so they ensure governments act in their interest and not in ours.</p><figure name="dc77" id="dc77" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 479px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 68.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bTLAtIW-vWt1beQ2vbRGyg.jpeg" data-width="3300" data-height="2257" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*bTLAtIW-vWt1beQ2vbRGyg.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bTLAtIW-vWt1beQ2vbRGyg.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonaddresses the Comité de Paris at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21).

The most common mistake is to interpret the climate crisis as a problem of advocacy. That governments simply require more briefings, more lobbies, more meetings, more press conferences, to educate them about the severity of the climate crisis. We could fill entire buildings with all the reports and evidence that NGOs have published.</p><p name="507a" id="507a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real problem is not ignorance of the facts, it’s that we do not have sufficient power to overcome the powerful vested interests that are blocking climate action. Banks, big business and elites who profit from climate inaction are more powerful than we are, and more powerful than poorer developing countries on the frontline of climate impacts. Without understanding that this is about power and politics we can’t understand what climate negotiations are really about or what the climate justice movement needs to do.</p><h4 name="e4a0" id="e4a0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">But do you think it’s just a problem where the analysis is misguided, or is it also the case that climate change is afforded the patience of advocacy, because many of those who campaign on it are detached from the burning impacts.</em></h4><p name="d8f1" id="d8f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The reality is the dominant assumptions and starting points of climate campaigning is shaped by the political interests and physical reality of the Global North.</p><p name="9a30" id="9a30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best example of this is the discussion about temperature targets. Now this might sound very technical — I mean all this talk is exactly the kind of jargon that alienates people from conversations about climate change — but these numbers are really some of the most important in the world. The temperatures we reach determine the kind of world we have.</p><p name="cf3e" id="cf3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, even though Paris gave us the symbolic victory of a 1.5°C target, many organisations continue to fail to take it seriously. To stay below 1.5°C means that we can only continue to pollute at current levels for another 5 years. Every country must do its fair share of effort and begin a drastic transformation of the global economy, starting today. But in the name of “pragmatism” and “realism”, so many in civil society either revert to the target of 2°C, or call for action to stay below 1.5°C at best without making any specific demands or at worst with actual policy demands fall way short of what is required by climate science</p><p name="1d0a" id="1d0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if someone tells you that 1.5°C is not worth fighting for, they must be asked at what cost in human lives and livelihoods. They have to that you are willing to answer how many people in the Global South they are willing to be sacrificed in the interest of their pragmatism. From the perspective of climate justice, we must not only stand with the most vulnerable communities, with the poorest countries, but ensure that our accountability is to those on the frontline One hundred of the poorest countries, climate scientists, social movements and climate justice organisations called for a temperature ceiling of 1.5°C, because the climate impacts associated with 2°C will be catastrophic. Every additional decimal point, every minimal degree of temperature rise, will exact a heavy price on those least responsible for the climate crisis.</p><figure name="931d" id="931d" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 296px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XDy_QuYYku54aU_f4ldYeQ.jpeg" data-width="2720" data-height="1532" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*XDy_QuYYku54aU_f4ldYeQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XDy_QuYYku54aU_f4ldYeQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Two farmers in rural Mozambique break into the earth, dessicated through drought.

The equivalent odds would see 30,000 airplanes crashing each and every single day. Western citizens would never set foot in an airport if those were the odds of their crashing if they flew. But many Western countries, movements and NGOs are happy to accept such devastating probabilities for those facing climate impacts in the Global South. They’re also willing to accept scientific models underpinned by false solutions and fantasy technologies.</p><blockquote name="b474" id="b474" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Western citizens would never set foot in an airport if those were the odds of their crashing if they flew.

It’s the richest 10% of the world, the overwhelming majority in the Global North who are responsible for 50% of global emissions, and the poorest 50% who live in the Global South who are responsible for only 10% of emissions.

An average citizen in the USA has a per capita income of over $55,000 whilst a citizen of Mali has a per capita income of only $700 dollars.

When you spend more energy talking about developing countries than your own governments continued addiction to dirty energy then you’re accepting that the burden of tackling climate change should fall on the poor, and those struggling to acquire the basic fundamentals in life, rather than the rich.

It makes tackling climate change, something to be achieved in the future, because that’s when it’s about saving our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. But from a climate justice perspective, this crisis is not about tomorrow, or about our future generations. Talking about future generations marginalises the reality of impacts today. It says that Black Lives Don’t Matter as much as the lives of white European children. Shutting our eyes to the realities of climate impacts today is why the climate movement is able to look the other way when it comes to the broken bodies of men, women and children washing up on the shores of the Mediterranean seeking safe haven. If you look at where many of those people are coming from, they are coming from places where multiple injustices fuse together.</p><p name="8c10" id="8c10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Syria, you have a collision of war, conflict and persecution, but you also have a five-year drought which killed 80% of all livestock and drove up to 2 million people from rural areas toward urban areas, exacerbating existing tensions.

We know from the International Red Cross that environmental refugees or environmentally-induced refugees are now beginning to overtake the number of refugees created by conflict.

But this isn’t true; the culprits of climate change can be found in financial institutions, dirty energy corporations, and our governments. Simply calling for action without concrete demands is not just an empty demand. At best its an escape hatch for those responsible for climate change to claim they are acting, at worst it undermines the need for movements to hold the real climate criminals to account.</p><blockquote name="3ff0" id="3ff0" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">In Pakistan over the last few years we’ve experienced recurring summer heatwaves, causing the deaths of thousands.

These were unprecedented levels of violence. Our homes were attacked and firebombed, we were attacked on the way to school, we were attacked at school. It was a total failure of what you might call “those in power”, from the school to the police to the national state, to take those experiences of violence seriously.</p><blockquote name="41d5" id="41d5" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">For black people of my generation, second-generation British Asians growing up in the late 1970s and early 80s, our lives were shaped by our experiences of racist violence, and the failure of the state to respond to that violence.</blockquote><p name="9b60" id="9b60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">That’s what lead me into the anti-racist movement, experiencing the firebombing of our family home, suffering pervasive racist violence at school. I gained my early political awareness through trying to understand that violence, both why it was happening but also what we could do about it. And I learnt some very important lessons.</p><p name="86fc" id="86fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, that the people who are most impacted need to be at the forefront of any struggle for justice. Otherwise the response to injustice is shaped by others considerations and priorities, rather than what is actually needed. We coined a slogan at the time that reflected that idea: “he/she who feels it, leads it”.</p><p name="cc8a" id="cc8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We strongly felt that the anti-racist movement had to be led by people of colour, by black people who had direct experiences with racism. We would not accept our struggle being appropriated by others, who saw us as passive foot soldiers whilst they made decisions on our behalf based on their own political self-interests. We realized the importance of black self-organisation, this idea that our movements should be black-led, rooted in our own communities, shaped by our own narratives. Ultimately the fight against racism in the UK, whether against right-wing violence or state violence (deaths in custody, police violence, police neglect), was a fight for justice that we ourselves had to lead.</p><p name="9100" id="9100" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We also learnt a lot about the inter-connectedness of our struggles in the UK with the struggles in our countries of origin against colonialism and imperialism. Not only were the power structures we were fighting against in the UK were the same ones that communities in our countries of origin were fighting against, but the same racist ideology was being used to de-humanise us and to legitimise white supremacy. On a practical level, many in our communities were transplanted to the UK because of colonial-economic needs. The reason we are here is because they were over there. People were brought from South Asia to work in the knitting mills in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and people from the Caribbean were brought for the steel industry and the National Health Service in big cities. We were put where our labour was needed, and forced to live in some of the worst housing and most deprived areas because of ‘colour bars’ as to where we could live.</p><p name="055f" id="055f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All these experiences made us realize the issues we were fighting were not just local. Our actions in the UK not only had a material impact on weakening the global forces of racism and colonialism but because we were in the “belly of the beast” we had a unique responsibility to be the voices of our communities abroad. We had to connect our fight against racism with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe, the liberation struggles in Angola and Namibia, the struggles in Latin America against military dictatorships, and the struggle of the Palestinian people to end occupation.</p><p name="4e51" id="4e51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All these experiences left me with important questions: how do you understand issues of power, privilege &amp; class?

I started as an activist fighting for social, economic and racial justice, but I’ve come to recognise that climate is an arena where our movements in the South are fighting, and what they’re really fighting for is the right to life, against inequality and injustice and to end the neo-liberal economic system that is responsible. That means as black activists in the UK, we have a responsibility, to be their voice in the North, to act in solidarity with those on the frontline and to be accountable to them in our actions.</p><p name="8e66" id="8e66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The climate movement in the Global North, particularly in the UK, has many parallels with the mainstream anti-racist movements in the 1960s and 1970s, largely led by white and middle class people, many with good intentions. But it was they who determined the tactics, the strategy and even when to claim victory. They urged us in the black community to be patient, wanting to declare the fight against fascism won, even whilst our communities were under daily attack by racists. They were able to do so because they weren’t facing the realities of racism as we were. Our view in black led anti-racist movements was why should we have to wait? When you feel the fire of injustice, you can’t afford to be patient.</p><h4 name="2413" id="2413" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">What does accountability to the Global South and to communities of colour mean in the context of climate change?</em></h4><p name="8d32" id="8d32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The question black activists are asking now around the world is: do Black Lives Matter? Because if Black Lives Matter, if that’s the metric at which you start, then you are no longer able to say: well we have to be pragmatic, we have to be conscious of national circumstances. When you recognise that people are drowning in the Mediterranean because they’re fleeing war, inequality and climate impacts, it’s not good enough to just say I’m going to react by just marching for refugees.

If you prefer to explain climate change by using images of polar bears, you’re basically colluding in eradicating the realities of our experiences. Climate change is first and foremost about our lives. So whilst nature and polar bears are crucial, and one part of the climate story, by becoming the symbol of the climate movement, it diminished the reality of people of the Global South who are already suffering impacts. On the flip side, when people of the Global South are featured, it’s usually as passive ‘victims’ of climate change, with no agency, looking to be ‘saved’.</p><blockquote name="ab79" id="ab79" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Climate change is first and foremost about our lives.

It is based on elite advocacy. It chooses to pursue a power that comes from being part of inner political circles. It’s populated by people who have no meaningful connection with those suffering the devastating impacts. And that distance, that lack of accountability, means that you can celebrate the piecemeal victories, the legislative tweaks, the little amendments of language.</p><p name="f6d0" id="f6d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whereas if you’re accountable to movements in the Global South, you know that you can’t go back to them and say: look I know your food system is being destroyed, I know you’re experiencing super-typhoons that kill thousands and displace millions, but in the UK we can’t afford to be too radical.</p><p name="b363" id="b363" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By in large, in the UK the political elite who dominate government bodies, NGOs, and the media, are too often part of the same cosy club, sharing a common class and educational background. They have a comfortable language and a comfortable way of talking to each other. They have become co-opted to such an extent that their biggest fear is not being part of the ‘club’, so no one wants to rock the boat too much. And they end up not telling the truth about climate change and gravitate towards framing climate change as an apolitical, abstract issue.</p><p name="9aa0" id="9aa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Climate change is unquestionably political. Being honest about climate change means understanding that maintaining the economic and political status quo is already causing colossal destruction.</p><p name="96e3" id="96e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But in a context dominated by unaccountable politics, it becomes radical to talk what’s needed. It becomes radical to be truthful about climate change. It becomes radical to talk about caring about people impacted. What’s not seen as radical is allowing the climate crisis to continue in way we’ve seen, to give preference to the right of the elite to maintain their dominant position.</p><p name="43a4" id="43a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Climate justice movements are continually framed as being outside legitimate political conversation. This is same language that governments use — they point their finger at radicals and position themselves as the voice of measured reason. NGOs employ the same game — they portray the climate justice movement as radical, depicting themselves as calm, collected and policy-literate.</p><p name="a140" id="a140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What we need is a 180 degree shift among those who for the last forty years have led the traditional climate movement. This strand of civil society, that dominates the political stage, that has the ear of governments and the media, tends to be made up of Northern NGOs. These are organisations who talk about the experiences of people in the Global South, but speak on their behalf. They have led the climate movement in a way that hasn’t really built a diverse and potent movement, that hasn’t given us a deep analysis of climate change, and hasn’t really achieved major successes. Until as a broad movement we are far more truthful about the urgency, until we are far more resolute in denouncing governments and corporations that are blocking change, until affected communities are listened to in the corridors of power, until their voices become anchors of the demands we make, then there will be little change.</p><h4 name="2687" id="2687" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">You’ve described yourself a “reluctant environmentalist”.

For instance, in the Global North, addressing climate change is frequently seen as an environmental issue. But many in the South don’t deconstruct their fights the way we do. They don’t distinguish between environmental, economic or political fights. They see it as a fight for justice, a fight for liberation.</p><p name="54fd" id="54fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s also another problem, which is when movements simply state that climate change is such a systemic issue, and there is no solution but revolution. This reminds me of discussions I had in the early 1980s. I was at a meeting of a left party, and I raised the issue of pervasive racist violence in the UK, asking what could do about it. People were sympathetic, agreeing with me that it was a very important issue, but the general response was: “do you know comrade, that the only way to eradicate racism is to overthrow capitalism? Racism will be solved when the revolution comes!”</p><p name="0c09" id="0c09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I said, “that’s not a message I will take back to my community, that we have to wait until the revolution.” I believed that tackling racism would be how we delivered social transformation.</p><p name="a0e6" id="a0e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly tackling climate change is how we can realise the transformation needed and be able to have a positive vision for the future. When you change the way we produce and consume energy, the way we produce and consume food, you’re talking about a very different kind of world. You’re talking about displacing some of the most powerful companies on the planet — those that control most of the food supply, those that bankroll the political establishment, those that receive trillions of dollars in public subsidies, those that are responsible for most of global emissions.</p><figure name="faa3" id="faa3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WpTX2ZspnC1LfcRL1phMSw.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*WpTX2ZspnC1LfcRL1phMSw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WpTX2ZspnC1LfcRL1phMSw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Asad Rehman, speaking at an event on the expansion Heathrow Airport, 2016.

We need to speak to those people, and we need to reframe migration with clarity: the issue is not migration, it’s the power of corporations and our governments.</blockquote><figure name="e960" id="e960" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--pullquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 350px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xvDaMK_HutwTe_PjvGbcQQ.jpeg" data-width="3456" data-height="2304" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*xvDaMK_HutwTe_PjvGbcQQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*xvDaMK_HutwTe_PjvGbcQQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Asad Rehman addresses This Changes Everything, 2015.

We’ve done it before: we did it with slavery, when people said they would support struggles for emancipation. We’ve done with colonialism and imperialism, when people supported struggles for liberation. And we’ll do it again, supporting struggles to stop the destruction of people’s homes and livelihoods.</p><p name="00b3" id="00b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To get there, we need to broadly agree on a theory of change. Most people recognize that only the power of people — real movement-building — is what can create the kind of power needed to be able to make truly transformational changes.</p><p name="e6ec" id="e6ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The environmental movement is increasingly aware that it cannot win on climate change alone — from a practical point of view, they have to build power. Building power means going and organising people, where they are. It means listening to the daily issues people face and working from there. The only solution to our weakness is solidarity. To win what we need to win, we have to do lateral movement-building.</p><p name="a78b" id="a78b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The silos that divide us will have to disappear. We’ll have to be able to sit together as organizations and movements and say: these are fights we need to win, and we’re going to collectively prioritise those. It’s a challenge, but everything seems impossible until it starts to get possible. This is what you have to get people to realize.</p><h4 name="9472" id="9472" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">Donald Trump has recently been inaugurated as the president of the United States.

Why aren’t those people with us? What was our mistake? That’s a reflection we need to undertake. Is that because we spent more of our time speaking to each other, rather than going out and speaking to ordinary people? Is our language or our way of organising inaccessible?</p><p name="64e2" id="64e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Progressive movements have vacated many spaces. There are abandoned estates, towns, and cities where the left used to be, engaging in real solidarity and organising. Today we’ve become over-attached to clicktivism, to our Facebook posts and Twitter threads. These are useful tools but they’re not the answer. If you look at the right everywhere, in Europe and elsewhere, they are going to the spaces where the left used to be.</p><figure name="732d" id="732d" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 350px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qBFY3rbcgqoZLiO7xFM2WA.jpeg" data-width="4508" data-height="3005" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*qBFY3rbcgqoZLiO7xFM2WA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*qBFY3rbcgqoZLiO7xFM2WA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dump Trump Protest, New York City, 2016.

Whether you’re black or Muslim or transgender or a climate activist or against poverty — you now have a common enemy. That forces movements to unite and say clearly that an injury to one is an injury to all. I’m hoping that the consequence of his election is that we all start saying, whoever he comes for, we’ll come for him. I’m hoping that the politics of division and persecution will force movements into the politics of solidarity. The unfolding horror of the world needs to be a fuel we use in our favour.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="u-paddingTop10"><div class="container u-maxWidth740"><div class="row"><div

Until as a broad movement we are far more truthful about the urgency, until we are far more resolute in denouncing governments and corporations that are blocking change, until affected communities are listened to in the corridors of power, until their voices become anchors of the demands we make, then there will be little change.","markups":[]},{"name":"2687","type":13,"text":"You’ve described yourself a “reluctant environmentalist”. In a way, “reluctant environmentalism” is something that has plagued a lot of the left or progressive community.

For instance, in the Global North, addressing climate change is frequently seen as an environmental issue. But many in the South don’t deconstruct their fights the way we do. They don’t distinguish between environmental, economic or political fights. They see it as a fight for justice, a fight for liberation.","markups":[]},{"name":"54fd","type":1,"text":"There’s also another problem, which is when movements simply state that climate change is such a systemic issue, and there is no solution but revolution. This reminds me of discussions I had in the early 1980s. I was at a meeting of a left party, and I raised the issue of pervasive racist violence in the UK, asking what could do about it. People were sympathetic, agreeing with me that it was a very important issue, but the general response was: “do you know comrade, that the only way to eradicate racism is to overthrow capitalism? Racism will be solved when the revolution comes!”","markups":[]},{"name":"0c09","type":1,"text":"I said, “that’s not a message I will take back to my community, that we have to wait until the revolution.” I believed that tackling racism would be how we delivered social transformation.","markups":[]},{"name":"a0e6","type":1,"text":"Similarly tackling climate change is how we can realise the transformation needed and be able to have a positive vision for the future.
