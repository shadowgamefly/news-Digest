name="c4f6" id="c4f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The inspection was not a glamorous thing. Alex had every port and plug snapped into and jacked up. He looked like a fucking Christmas Tree with a tangle of wires and ports and lights. Not that anyone here in cosmic utopian la-la land had any idea what Christmas was anymore, nor did they practice the engineered corporate holiday.</p><p name="c921" id="c921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The joke about Christmas he was planning to employ wasn’t viable and he stifled the grin that was threatening to blossom on his face as inspectors hovered. A pretty pale girl pulled his head to the side and stuck an implement in his ear. It felt like a toothpick and it looked like something out of Alien.</p><p name="f1ab" id="f1ab" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This is incredibly uncomfortable.”</p><p name="702f" id="702f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She said nothing in response, and her gaze fell on him like he was nothing more than a potted plant. It felt incredibly disarming for him to feel like a living doll, as Polly had treated him as the days went on like a real flesh and blood man. They had laughed, he had braided her hair while sitting cross-legged on the table, the girl fidgeting as she wanted to look perfect.</p><p name="4a60" id="4a60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She had never had a french braid before. She didn’t even know what one was. But Al had braided his closest friends’ hair when he was still in his own skin, so many thousands of years ago. Percy liked her hair brushed. Her girlfriend, Olivia, liked her hair pink. And so he had been the designated stylist. It was better him than Dominik, who, with his big stupid hands, would’ve ended up ruining any style he had tried to bring to fruition like some kindof uncultured beast. He probably would’ve tied it into knots.</p><p name="c88c" id="c88c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Al missed them all. He missed Percy especially, and if Dominik could hear his thoughts within the expanse of time, he might have just been a little bit jealous. But he was the one who left, wasn’t he?</p><p name="1abc" id="1abc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A fragment of a memory told him so. That was what had happened, right?</p><blockquote name="e328" id="e328" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Al. Alex. Hey. Are you ok?”</blockquote><blockquote name="8165" id="8165" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--pullquote">“Yeah, Percy. I’m fine. Just thinking about…”</blockquote><blockquote name="b112" id="b112" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--pullquote">“He’s not coming back. You need to fucking get over it.”</blockquote><p name="ed4a" id="ed4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">He remembered their names and bits and pieces of who he had been. But they came on slowly like consciousness from a deep, deep sleep. Like an ocean he was stuck under, a bright red creature of the deep, black sea would float by and he’d catch it with his hands and keep the glow between his fingers. He needed to remember. And to keep the memories safe.</p><p name="ed27" id="ed27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When he had braided Polly’s hair, the back of her head not unlike Percy’s in shape, he had remembered a bit. The drowsy sleep of memory slipping like a sliver into the back of his head. Red, bright, and it burned. It felt painful, like something was unpacking itself, and his program had hitched for a moment and he had stopped braiding.</p><blockquote name="3267" id="3267" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why do you have so many split ends?”<br>“It’s all the bleach. Duh.”<br>“…don’t you condition this shit?”<br>“Yeah I do, but unlike you I can’t afford that fancy crap, or like, whatever.”<br>“Percy. I gave you a credit card…”</blockquote><p name="35e5" id="35e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">He resumed a few seconds later, with Polly none-the-wiser. He wasn’t supposed to remember this quickly. He wasn’t supposed to feel what he felt. The sensations in his body picking back up again, cold and heat, and pain, and discomfort, like with the tooth pick. He wasn’t supposed to flush at Polly’s compliments. He wasn’t supposed to have the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. They weren’t even hairs to begin with. And the ‘tooth pick’ in his ear shouldn’t have been felt, and if anything, it should’ve been a hazy, distant sensation, like having sympathy pains for someone else’s discomfort.</p><p name="288c" id="288c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it wasn’t.</p><p name="9ce9" id="9ce9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He felt his skin prickle, and the inspector made a noise and checked her clear tablet. He winced as she had left the thing in his ear like a sadist.</p><p name="f4bd" id="f4bd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You aren’t supposed to respond like that.”<br>“Alright, then let me shove a tooth pick into your ear canal and see how you feel about it then, ass,” he said with a sneer and she blinked at him, blandly, with her large, vacant eyes.</p><p name="c6ad" id="c6ad" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Tooth pick?”</p><p name="ca59" id="ca59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wanted to be the wise-cracking asshole he had been when he was in his own body but he couldn’t be. Because all his jokes were out of time.</p><p name="a7aa" id="a7aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He quite simply didn’t measure up to the ‘kids these days’. Even that phrase wasn’t used, and ‘get off my lawn’ meant nothing. There were no lawns. Only white marble, only plain and basic, only ‘beautifully’ modern. He wasn’t a fan of ‘modern’. He preferred bright and glaring like the pink yarrow of the eighties, or the grungy flannel of the nineties.</p><p name="8c3b" id="8c3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And, unbeknownst to him, black grates textured like tar, hundreds of floors beneath where he was sitting, were also a type of floor he would yet see.</p><p name="c344" id="c344" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He’d stand speechless at the difference.</p><p name="fdc3" id="fdc3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why do you care about what my ass feels?” The inspector was a great bit dumber than Polly was when she took her PATHOS in the mornings before coming to see him. That mood stabilizing drug made the people here flat and docile. He didn’t like it.</p><p name="8cce" id="8cce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly covered her mouth with her hand and hid her large smile behind perfectly manicured fingers. He could see her diaphragm moving behind her skin as she laughed to herself, silently.</p><p name="a06c" id="a06c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were perks to being a synth.</p><p name="8bb9" id="8bb9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are you going to make it?”</p><p name="d29a" id="d29a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No.” He gave her a grimace, and she gave him a fake pouted frown as the female inspector wrenched his head back and started poking around in his mouth.</p><p name="4dcc" id="4dcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly was different from the start, a different type of human animal, even medicated. She had watched some of the video reels of his past memory, she had picked up on the ideas and culture he had been brought up in. And she was, at the time of her cognitive transition between childhood and adolescence, altogether different.</p><p name="3134" id="3134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She had a voice. She had an opinion. It was rare, and she guarded it jealously. And he was helping her cultivate it, one day at a time, with old ideas that were new to her. They sounded sweet in her ears, the stories he told her that he could remember, and she had often fallen asleep with her head in his lap as he stroked her hair. As Percy had done in the time before now.</p><p name="f6c2" id="f6c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was getting too close.</p><p name="2392" id="2392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like this stupid asshole digging around in his tonsils with a far larger object than the Alien tooth pick. At least he didn’t have a gag reflex and nor did he need to breathe to live.</p><p name="6d72" id="6d72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex thought it was amusing to think of in the abstract, and wanted to make an inappropriate joke, but the minute she moved away, and he opened his mouth to speak, the stern, pale, bloodless male inspector snapped a glove over his hand like a very real threat.</p><p name="886d" id="886d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wouldn’t be making a snappy comment. Instead, his smile faded, as the man pressed at his chest and the piece of plasticine and graphine clicked open. It was horrifying.</p><p name="527e" id="527e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex looked down at his fake insides, blue and pale, bright and buzzing with chemicals, but with all the trappings of a normal body. He had a heart of sorts, a very bright, powerful core that sat within his chest a bit to the left of center.</p><p name="7944" id="7944" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This is going to be uncomfortable.”</p><p name="9f4c" id="9f4c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Uh-huh.”</p><p name="93ea" id="93ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The male inspector pushed his long, thin fingers in between Alexei’s ‘heart’ and ‘rib cage’ and tugged at something. Alex instantly shot Polly a look who was staring at the ministrations behind her two hands. They covered her eyes, and yet she still watched. If only to offer him the comfort of knowing she was keeping an eye on things.</p><p name="ce4f" id="ce4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She had spent time with plenty of other synthetics and should’ve been used to this by now. But with him, it was different. He was different. He was altogether a unique creature. For he had a soul of sorts, at least she thought he did.</p><p name="e21a" id="e21a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Counsel wasn’t so sure of that, and they’d rather he not have anything at all except for a run-time protocol that followed every single one of their specific, deliberate orders. Even the disgusting ones. Even the ones that verged on genocide. Even the ones that verged on placing him in unwanted situations.</p><p name="8f83" id="8f83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He didn’t know what his role was yet. But he would soon learn.</p><p name="98e3" id="98e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And he wouldn’t be happy about it.</p><p name="d853" id="d853" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Can you…stop molesting my inner organs, please and thank you?”<br>“I’m finished.”</p><p name="d197" id="d197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The inspector took his gloves off and tossed them into a trash receptacle, a bit of blue fluid on the stark white plastic.</p><p name="e608" id="e608" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It seems to be in working order, but it’s responses, as you have intimated are beyond the scope of what it was designed to do. I am unsure it is wise to proceed, but I trust your judgment Andra.”</p><p name="9674" id="9674" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Thank you, Stefan. It is vital <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">he</em> is in working order. However, I think he’s important to study — ”</p><p name="aa73" id="aa73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stefan raised a hand to silence her, his stark, stern brows narrowing over sharp, small eyes. “I’m going to stop you there, Andra. You are not a scientist. Section 9 will deem if it’s important to study it or not. But for now, you’ve done a good job acclimating it.”</p><p name="528c" id="528c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stefan leaned forward to the curve of Polly’s ear and whispered, low in his throat. “You are too close to this, An. Make sure it behaves appropriately when approaching others or they may not be as kind as I or Lily have been.”</p><p name="2cad" id="2cad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lily’s long, blonde lashes closed slowly and she stifled a yawn with her hand as she began to unhook the very human, very pissed off robot. Stefan turned to help her, and soon they were finished unhooking him, leaving Alex sitting stark naked with his legs curled up at his chest.</p><p name="0335" id="0335" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Can you get me some fucking pants? What is it with you people and stripping me…” Alex stared at Stefan and Lily beneath his strong brows, his jaw clenching. They saw him as about as sentient as a lamp, so the modesty was confusing for the pair of inspectors.</p><p name="67a0" id="67a0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…very good,” Stefan said bluntly, shooting Polly a stare that spelled danger. Alex caught the interaction and his expression soured. Polly’s mouth tasted like metal and she swallowed hard, and crossed her arms.</p><p name="7ba6" id="7ba6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pair left and the glass door shut behind them with a hiss and a click.</p><p name="83e8" id="83e8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“………..Polly.”<br>“Yes, right, sorry!” She scrambled to attention and clicked over on her gold heels to pick up his clothes. They were plain and uninteresting like boiled cabbage soup. He had eaten that a lot as a kid, as it was a staple of his homeland. But it didn’t mean he had found it appetizing.</p><p name="680d" id="680d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That thought stuck with him as he stood, immodestly, and took the pants from her, to pull them on without a scrap of decency. She looked away, giving him the modesty he was not bothering to have for her. He wouldn’t have been embarrassed around Percy, so why would he…?</p><p name="1ac3" id="1ac3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You don’t have to look away.”<br>“…why wouldn’t I…?”<br>“I’m not human, remember? I’m an ‘it’ who knows too much that you want to study, right?”</p><p name="bc9f" id="bc9f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m a science project.”</p><p name="4f12" id="4f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly stood with his shirt in her hand as he snapped and velcroed his pants.</p><p name="0d62" id="0d62" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…so you heard..”<br>“Of course I heard. I’m Second, remember? Turns out I was probably a spy, and it turns out the pharmacist who makes your pills just a few rooms down really hates his job and wishes his wife were dead.”</p><p name="592c" id="592c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I guess the complaints are still the same, even centuries later.” Alex jerked his shirt out of Polly’s hands and pulled it over his head.</p><p name="bf78" id="bf78" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I want to get some work done.”<br>“…excuse me?”<br>“I don’t look like myself. And I want my tattoos back.”<br>“…Tattoos are outlawed.”<br>“Yeah, yeah, I know. So is sex between anyone below a Section 10 rank, drugs, rock and roll, and fun. Never fun. No more fun, ever.”</p><p name="f4d8" id="f4d8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Aren’t you a Section 11, Pol?”</p><p name="d1ad" id="d1ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly wrapped her arms around her chest and squeezed to comfort herself, arms crossed, and let her rosy lip be bitten in her nervousness.</p><p name="aeda" id="aeda" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…I don’t even know what..what would work on you..”<br>“You’re a cosmetics engineer, aren’t you?”<br>“Yeah, but they don’t teach us banned practices, obviously.”</p><p name="a5e6" id="a5e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex ducked to look into one of the monitors and ruffled his hair. Then came putting on his shoes, not that he really needed to wear them anyways.</p><p name="74f6" id="74f6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The Director also doesn’t want me changing your face.”<br>“Fuck the Director.”<br>“…Alex, you can’t just go around saying things like that..”<br>“I won’t. When I’m here, I’m me. When I’m out there, I’m ‘it’. I get it Polly, really I do,” Al walked towards the nervous girl and placed his hands on her shoulders.</p><p name="7432" id="7432" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…no one up here will do it for you. They’d be punished for it.”<br>“…ok. So…where would we go?”<br>“We’d have to go Below.”<br>“….which is where, exactly?”</p><p name="6fc0" id="6fc0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s where they keep the lessers. The underdwellers. The people they don’t want the citizens to see.”</p><p name="2f2e" id="2f2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex removed his hands from her shoulders and placed a hand on his hip.<br>“So, it’s a ghetto.”<br>“……yes. A very large ghetto.”<br>“Would they get in trouble for fixing me up?”<br>“No. We don’t even have ID tags for them, no one would know who it was. But you’re going to need to clear us to go down there…I don’t have that kindof clearance.”</p><p name="10ca" id="10ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly held up her wrist and showed him a small, pale blue design.</p><p name="188c" id="188c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s a barcode.”<br>“Yup. Didn’t you notice you had one?”<br>“…no. I just assumed it was a…tattoo.”<br>“You aren’t who you were before.”<br>“….I know.”</p><p name="3f44" id="3f44" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And when I said study, I didn’t mean like a lab rat. I meant…like something we’ve never seen before. Like a real person…” Polly flicked his chest with her finger making a dull, muffled ping.</p><p name="06a5" id="06a5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…beneath all that stupid plastic and metal and blue bubbling goopy crap, or whatever.”<br>“Well, fuck you very much.”</p><p name="6d30" id="6d30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly smirked and took Al’s wrist and held up the barcode.</p><p name="8ff2" id="8ff2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You can go anywhere you want now. Now that you’ve been cleared.”<br>“We.”<br>“Pardon?”</p><p name="6b31" id="6b31" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We can go anywhere we want.” Alex took Polly by the shoulder, his strong arm wrapped around her protectively, and approached the door. It opened for them with a slight hiss, and when they stepped on through, a pleasant click followed.</p><p name="5f49" id="5f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex looked down the hallway to the left, and then the right.</p><p name="cedd" id="cedd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s so….quiet.”</p><p name="e907" id="e907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He heard no laughter. It sounded nothing like the streets of New York, no screaming, no cars, no sirens, no children. He smelled no cigars, no greasy Chinese food, no pizza, no coffee, no chocolate. He felt no snow, he saw no sun, and he didn’t like any of it.</p><p name="ea00" id="ea00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And there were no cigarettes.</p><p name="061d" id="061d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…pull up the partition.”<br>“…fine, Mom.”</p><p name="1807" id="1807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He fell back like a child through panes of glass, falling like a stone, his consciousness flat-lining as the baseline operating system took hold. He sat back within his mind to take the reigns, gently. He moved himself, carefully observing his own inner workings, and making sure to maintain as loose a grasp as possible. Lest he be detected as an errant protocol.</p><p name="bfd4" id="bfd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They approached the elevator and he held up his wrist, and swiped it gently before the opening. They stepped inside and Polly took his arm from her shoulder. The arm laid lifeless by his side and she keened her head to look into his glassy, distant eyes.</p><p name="fa4c" id="fa4c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are…you still in there?” she whispered.</p><p name="dcf0" id="dcf0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hello, Second. Which floor do you require?” A caustically pleasant synthetic female voice chimed in around them within the stark white prison they stood inside of.</p><p name="5f5b" id="5f5b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“P15.” The standard OS knew where to go.</p><p name="d154" id="d154" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Of course. Please proceed with caution and remember that You Are Loved, You Are Valued, and You Are Special.” The elevator moved slowly at first, and then quickly, the gravity kicking in so the two appeared stable and inert while the machination bolted through space, down, down, to the depths of hell.</p><p name="ad14" id="ad14" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes.”</p><p name="292b" id="292b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly searched his face and he seemed to be ignoring her, or quite simply wasn’t processing stimuli. But when the elevator finally stopped and she stepped through, he caught her hand in his own and gave her a wink.</p><p name="43bc" id="43bc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Can I switch now?”<br>“We’ve got to pass a gate first. After.”</p><p name="59d7" id="59d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Al nodded and stepped after her, letting his hand drop away. It was dark. With every step the white faded away and the sterile smell began to give way to foulness. The smell of body fluids, a dank basement, and blood hit his nose. He didn’t know exactly how it smelled, but he could pick up the particles that told him what he should be smelling. His very human mind picked up the rest, and played the scents back in memory.</p><p name="199a" id="199a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He could smell now. And he could feel.</p><p name="9c36" id="9c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As they walked, stark white lights gave way to blue ones, and red ones, and the floor became pitch black, grated, and dirt-slick with oil and some other unmentionable garbage.</p><p name="058b" id="058b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Sir.”<br>“Yes.”<br>The guard before them was dressed in black with an obnoxious looking laser rifle. Alex thought the guards wore white but hadn’t seen one yet, and quickly engaged his database to find that each Section had different colors. They were segregated, and it felt a little bit too familiar. Section 9, the Science establishment, was yellow. And yet the inspectors had worn white.</p><p name="2946" id="2946" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What are you here for?…and what about the girl?”<br>He gave Alex a sly look and moved his hand over his grubby, slick mouth. Alex knew that look and he kept himself from sneering. It was difficult. The guard looked at Polly lecherously and grinned.</p><p name="c787" id="c787" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Business or pleasure?”<br>“Pleasure.”</p><p name="f6c0" id="f6c0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nice.” Alex held back every fiber within his body to take command again, to fully possess his body and shut off the second OS so he could strangle this little shit. Instead, he took the guard’s nametag in between his fingers and scanned his file from his name and code designation.</p><p name="5e9d" id="5e9d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Brahms. George Brahms?”<br>“Y-yeah. Yes sir.”</p><p name="b855" id="b855" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Very good, Brahms. You’re due for a promotion, aren’t you?”</p><p name="448c" id="448c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes sir!” Another guard walked towards them with a large, dumb grin painted on his face. He had his gun slung over his shoulder and stood with his hand on his hip.</p><p name="b94f" id="b94f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Howdy, sir.”<br>Alex disregarded the other one.</p><p name="8c22" id="8c22" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I will push the process along.”<br>“Great!”<br>“Man, you’re going to get a better pass and everything…get to fuck any of the lesser bitches without the Director or Section 2 batting a damn eye.”</p><p name="95cd" id="95cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex quietly filed a motion to Hard Reset and walked on by, taking Polly by the elbow who jerked forward on her golden heels.</p><p name="8855" id="8855" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Gentleman.”</p><p name="897a" id="897a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both guards stood at attention and saluted. “S-sir!”</p><p name="e5b0" id="e5b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He rolled his eyes and dragged Polly like she were a heavy satchel or a living barbie. She stumbled over her heels and played the part, resisting, but whispered into his ear “Y-you didn’t really…promote him, did you?”</p><p name="d70d" id="d70d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nope.”</p><p name="421c" id="421c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Then what?”</p><p name="7359" id="7359" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“He’s going to be sent out an airlock in three days.”</p><p name="95e3" id="95e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly stopped Alex and looked into his eyes. He finally pulled down the protocols and jammed his baseline system’s OS into it’s little hidey-hole, closing it down, defiantly. Pale baby blues came back to life, liquid in the iris of his eyes swirling with thousands of tiny lines of code, seen as simply a liquid movement of blue to the onlooker. Who was Polly, transfixed, and wide-eyed.</p><p name="85a1" id="85a1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are…you serious?”</p><p name="3285" id="3285" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Deadly serious.”</p><p name="ea2b" id="ea2b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“….wow.”</p><p name="22cc" id="22cc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Good thing you vouched for me, huh?

Children with dirty faces, hungry gazes, and hundreds if not thousands of people bustling within a central market. A market where cabbage was a commodity and cost five plus credits. A market that reminded him of China Town in Queens.</p><p name="ff64" id="ff64" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Where are they getting the cabbage from?”<br>“The black market. It’s run by one of the Section Firsts, or so I hear…I don’t really know.”<br>“You don’t know?” Polly wrapped her arms around herself and looked at the people as they scrambled around the perfectly pale pair. She looked uneasy and used a quick hand to scrape her hair behind her ear.</p><p name="bc96" id="bc96" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’ve…never been here before.”<br>“Nope.”</p><p name="e4e2" id="e4e2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hey!

This guy’s just givin’ out hundreds!” A crowd began to form, and the pale pair then knew just how grave Al’s mistake had just been.</p><p name="6a90" id="6a90" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Al…”<br>“Let’s get out of here.”</p><p name="0d17" id="0d17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex was faster than he was used to and Polly began to lag behind. Even at his prime, fighting for his family and his friends against someone or something he couldn’t remember very clearly, he had never been this spry. It took a moment for him to notice, but he turned back and swept up Polly in his arms and popped up with one foot on an oil drum and launched over a wall.</p><p name="1f2f" id="1f2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A very, very high wall.</p><p name="002c" id="002c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She screamed the entire way down and he landed, not skipping a beat, and placed her on her feet as she wobbled on shaking legs.</p><p name="8577" id="8577" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…are you a…military issue?!”</p><p name="fdbb" id="fdbb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No I’m a fucking ninja.”</p><p name="2267" id="2267" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wasn’t serious, and yet he was. The jump surprised even him.

Hey, don’t get mad at me..”</p><p name="1731" id="1731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The two bickered as they walked. Like he had bickered with Percy, teasing each other, snide comments and casual friendly flirting. It felt the same to him. It was the same, for all intents and purposes, but Polly wasn’t Percy.</p><p name="b7be" id="b7be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex stared at her as she talked and traced her face with his eyes, catching her small little blonde facial hair that she tried to hide yet almost every human had, and the occasional freckle that she concealed with makeup.</p><p name="1b13" id="1b13" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You look just like her.”</p><p name="0f7a" id="0f7a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“But…I’m not her.”</p><p name="fb7f" id="fb7f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are you so sure?”</p><p name="a4d0" id="a4d0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What do you mean?”</p><p name="3350" id="3350" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…do you ever wonder about time?” Alex picked up a piece of metal from the floor and began to bend it into shape. He was stronger than he had been before, too. He twisted the metal with his fingers and made a flower. Simple lines, nothing fancy, just a daisy.</p><p name="cc4e" id="cc4e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…no?”</p><p name="dee1" id="dee1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex played with the metal flower, pulling at the petals to form them into something a bit prettier.</p><p name="6809" id="6809" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Like…of all the people that would have been alive now, you are here, and you look just like her. Of all the people who would’ve taken care of me and made sure I transitioned to my role again…it would be you.”</p><p name="840f" id="840f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They picked me.”</p><p name="5470" id="5470" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes, but you don’t realize how much you look like her, do you?” She touched her face as they talked and looked away from him.</p><p name="15b6" id="15b6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Of all the people with all the names that have ever been, your middle name is Polly. It sounds like Percy.”</p><p name="00df" id="00df" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s just a coincidence.” They ducked underneath a tarp and Alex stopped her with his hand to her shoulder.</p><p name="9eb4" id="9eb4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are you sure?”</p><p name="b653" id="b653" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“..n — “</p><p name="707f" id="707f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s your favorite color?”</p><p name="db5f" id="db5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before Polly could answer, he told her. “Pink. Bright fuchsia pink and you like bright green as well. But I’m guessing they don’t let you wear that here.”</p><p name="8917" id="8917" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How..”</p><p name="8b06" id="8b06" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You are self-conscious because of some scar you have, you favor your right leg and you never wear shorter skirts without concealer on your inner thigh.

And I’m going to be right.”</p><p name="fe29" id="fe29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Polly’s eyes filled up with tears but she faced him, staring like he were a nova about to explode and destroy her.</p><p name="8f76" id="8f76" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And let me guess on this too…you started off as a secretary.”</p><p name="3530" id="3530" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You read my files.

Keep telling yourself that.” Alex patted his pockets and remembered he didn’t have cigarettes. And nor did he think they made them anymore.</p><p name="3997" id="3997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Silence cut into their time together, with Polly no longer holding his hand, and Alex with his jaw clenched.</p><p name="fc78" id="fc78" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“..what were you looking for?”</p><p name="8153" id="8153" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Something to occupy my mouth.” Polly snorted at his response.</p><p name="d1b6" id="d1b6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Seriously? Like…what?”</p><p name="8b90" id="8b90" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Don’t look at me like that, a cigarette, what else?”</p><p name="f8f0" id="f8f0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They..don’t make those anymore.”</p><p name="2460" id="2460" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I know.”</p><p name="c60e" id="c60e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And it wouldn’t do anything for you anyways…”</p><p name="0430" id="0430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex stuck the metal flower in his pocket and pressed on. They didn’t know what they were looking for. They didn’t know who they were looking for. And they didn’t know if they’d have another encounter like the mob of hungry hands they had just fled from.</p><p name="5ba8" id="5ba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A girl with a daisy on her shirt and curls of blonde hair darted past them. She had freckles on her skin, with sharp, almond-shaped eyes, and she hopped past like a child-ghost, striking Al’s vision like a glitched light leak. A glint of something caught the light. A sparkle, just one, in the air, suspended.</p><p name="1094" id="1094" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Olive.”</p><p name="d073" id="d073" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The girl scrunched her face up and waved her wrist at a merchant. She was complaining about the price of a large lot of power cells. She needed twenty or more.</p><p name="d5ba" id="d5ba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…Olive? Oh, right…no. I mean…she’s not, obviously.”</p><p name="e283" id="e283" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“….yes. Yes she is.”</p><p name="a402" id="a402" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are you sure the upload didn’t fry your circuits too?”</p><p name="c5f4" id="c5f4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m positive.”</p><p name="d3be" id="d3be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The little blonde thing with her cat-like eyes, large ears, and short stature turned to look at the pale pair who had stopped to watch her. She was caught in a freeze frame within Alexei’s eyes, her hair shining, her eyes slowly blinking, and the slow-motion of her head turning showed the bright freckles on her cheeks and neck. Her roots were coming in like Polly’s, and he saw a tint of pink along those curls, washed out with time as the strands of hair cast off like pen strokes into the air.</p><p name="9575" id="9575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She resumed her “negotiating”.</p><p name="6189" id="6189" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“ 阿呆!” She was calling the merchant an idiot and it made Alex smile.</p><p name="8dd4" id="8dd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">She was the same.

inspection was not a glamorous thing. Alex had every port and plug snapped into and jacked up. He looked like a fucking Christmas Tree with a tangle of wires and ports and lights. Not that anyone here in cosmic utopian la-la land had any idea what Christmas was anymore, nor did they practice the engineered corporate holiday.","markups":[]},{"name":"c921","type":1,"text":"The joke about Christmas he was planning to employ wasn’t viable and he stifled the grin that was threatening to blossom on his face as inspectors hovered. A pretty pale girl pulled his head to the side and stuck an implement in his ear. It felt like a toothpick and it looked like something out of Alien.","markups":[]},{"name":"f1ab","type":1,"text":"“This is incredibly uncomfortable.”","markups":[]},{"name":"702f","type":1,"text":"She said nothing in response, and her gaze fell on him like he was nothing more than a potted plant. It felt incredibly disarming for him to feel like a living doll, as Polly had treated him as the days went on like a real flesh and blood man. They had laughed, he had braided her hair while sitting cross-legged on the table, the girl fidgeting as she wanted to look perfect.","markups":[]},{"name":"4a60","type":1,"text":"She had never had a french braid before. She didn’t even know what one was. But Al had braided his closest friends’ hair when he was still in his own skin, so many thousands of years ago. Percy liked her hair brushed. Her girlfriend, Olivia, liked her hair pink. And so he had been the designated stylist. It was better him than Dominik, who, with his big stupid hands, would’ve ended up ruining any style he had tried to bring to fruition like some kindof uncultured beast. He probably would’ve tied it into knots.","markups":[]},{"name":"c88c","type":1,"text":"Al missed them all. He missed Percy especially, and if Dominik could hear his thoughts within the expanse of time, he might have just been a little bit jealous. But he was the one who left, wasn’t he?","markups":[]},{"name":"1abc","type":1,"text":"A fragment of a memory told him so. That was what had happened, right?","markups":[]},{"name":"e328","type":7,"text":"“Al. Alex. Hey. Are you ok?”","markups":[]},{"name":"8165","type":7,"text":"“Yeah, Percy. I’m fine. Just thinking about…”","markups":[]},{"name":"b112","type":7,"text":"“He’s not coming back. You need to fucking get over it.”","markups":[]},{"name":"ed4a","type":1,"text":"He remembered their names and bits and pieces of who he had been. But they came on slowly like consciousness from a deep, deep sleep. Like an ocean he was stuck under, a bright red creature of the deep, black sea would float by and he’d catch it with his hands and keep the glow between his fingers. He needed to remember. And to keep the memories safe.","markups":[]},{"name":"ed27","type":1,"text":"When he had braided Polly’s hair, the back of her head not unlike Percy’s in shape, he had remembered a bit. The drowsy sleep of memory slipping like a sliver into the back of his head. Red, bright, and it burned. It felt painful, like something was unpacking itself, and his program had hitched for a moment and he had stopped braiding.","markups":[]},{"name":"3267","type":7,"text":"“Why do you have so many split ends?”\n“It’s all the bleach. Duh.”\n“…don’t you condition this shit?”\n“Yeah I do, but unlike you I can’t afford that fancy crap, or like, whatever.”\n“Percy. I gave you a credit card…”","markups":[]},{"name":"35e5","type":1,"text":"He resumed a few seconds later, with Polly none-the-wiser. He wasn’t supposed to remember this quickly. He wasn’t supposed to feel what he felt. The sensations in his body picking back up again, cold and heat, and pain, and discomfort, like with the tooth pick. He wasn’t supposed to flush at Polly’s compliments. He wasn’t supposed to have the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. They weren’t even hairs to begin with. And the ‘tooth pick’ in his ear shouldn’t have been felt, and if anything, it should’ve been a hazy, distant sensation, like having sympathy pains for someone else’s discomfort.","markups":[]},{"name":"288c","type":1,"text":"But it wasn’t.","markups":[]},{"name":"9ce9","type":1,"text":"He felt his skin prickle, and the inspector made a noise and checked her clear tablet. He winced as she had left the thing in his ear like a sadist.","markups":[]},{"name":"f4bd","type":1,"text":"“You aren’t supposed to respond like that.”\n“Alright, then let me shove a tooth pick into your ear canal and see how you feel about it then, ass,” he said with a sneer and she blinked at him, blandly, with her large, vacant eyes.","markups":[]},{"name":"c6ad","type":1,"text":"“Tooth pick?”","markups":[]},{"name":"ca59","type":1,"text":"He wanted to be the wise-cracking asshole he had been when he was in his own body but he couldn’t be. Because all his jokes were out of time.","markups":[]},{"name":"a7aa","type":1,"text":"He quite simply didn’t measure up to the ‘kids these days’. Even that phrase wasn’t used, and ‘get off my lawn’ meant nothing. There were no lawns. Only white marble, only plain and basic, only ‘beautifully’ modern. He wasn’t a fan of ‘modern’. He preferred bright and glaring like the pink yarrow of the eighties, or the grungy flannel of the nineties.","markups":[]},{"name":"8c3b","type":1,"text":"And, unbeknownst to him, black grates textured like tar, hundreds of floors beneath where he was sitting, were also a type of floor he would yet see.","markups":[]},{"name":"c344","type":1,"text":"He’d stand speechless at the difference.","markups":[]},{"name":"fdc3","type":1,"text":"“Why do you care about what my ass feels?” The inspector was a great bit dumber than Polly was when she took her PATHOS in the mornings before coming to see him. That mood stabilizing drug made the people here flat and docile. He didn’t like it.","markups":[]},{"name":"8cce","type":1,"text":"Polly covered her mouth with her hand and hid her large smile behind perfectly manicured fingers. He could see her diaphragm moving behind her skin as she laughed to herself, silently.","markups":[]},{"name":"a06c","type":1,"text":"There were perks to being a synth.","markups":[]},{"name":"8bb9","type":1,"text":"“Are you going to make it?”","markups":[]},{"name":"d29a","type":1,"text":"“No.” He gave her a grimace, and she gave him a fake pouted frown as the female inspector wrenched his head back and started poking around in his mouth.","markups":[]},{"name":"4dcc","type":1,"text":"Polly was different from the start, a different type of human animal, even medicated. She had watched some of the video reels of his past memory, she had picked up on the ideas and culture he had been brought up in. And she was, at the time of her cognitive transition between childhood and adolescence, altogether different.","markups":[]},{"name":"3134","type":1,"text":"She had a voice. She had an opinion. It was rare, and she guarded it jealously. And he was helping her cultivate it, one day at a time, with old ideas that were new to her. They sounded sweet in her ears, the stories he told her that he could remember, and she had often fallen asleep with her head in his lap as he stroked her hair. As Percy had done in the time before now.","markups":[]},{"name":"f6c2","type":1,"text":"She was getting too close.","markups":[]},{"name":"2392","type":1,"text":"Like this stupid asshole digging around in his tonsils with a far larger object than the Alien tooth pick. At least he didn’t have a gag reflex and nor did he need to breathe to live.","markups":[]},{"name":"6d72","type":1,"text":"Alex thought it was amusing to think of in the abstract, and wanted to make an inappropriate joke, but the minute she moved away, and he opened his mouth to speak, the stern, pale, bloodless male inspector snapped a glove over his hand like a very real threat.","markups":[]},{"name":"886d","type":1,"text":"He wouldn’t be making a snappy comment. Instead, his smile faded, as the man pressed at his chest and the piece of plasticine and graphine clicked open. It was horrifying.","markups":[]},{"name":"527e","type":1,"text":"Alex looked down at his fake insides, blue and pale, bright and buzzing with chemicals, but with all the trappings of a normal body. He had a heart of sorts, a very bright, powerful core that sat within his chest a bit to the left of center.","markups":[]},{"name":"7944","type":1,"text":"“This is going to be uncomfortable.”","markups":[]},{"name":"9f4c","type":1,"text":"“Uh-huh.”","markups":[]},{"name":"93ea","type":1,"text":"The male inspector pushed his long, thin fingers in between Alexei’s ‘heart’ and ‘rib cage’ and tugged at something. Alex instantly shot Polly a look who was staring at the ministrations behind her two hands. They covered her eyes, and yet she still watched. If only to offer him the comfort of knowing she was keeping an eye on things.","markups":[]},{"name":"ce4f","type":1,"text":"She had spent time with plenty of other synthetics and should’ve been used to this by now. But with him, it was different. He was different. He was altogether a unique creature. For he had a soul of sorts, at least she thought he did.","markups":[]},{"name":"e21a","type":1,"text":"The Counsel wasn’t so sure of that, and they’d rather he not have anything at all except for a run-time protocol that followed every single one of their specific, deliberate orders. Even the disgusting ones. Even the ones that verged on genocide. Even the ones that verged on placing him in unwanted situations.","markups":[]},{"name":"8f83","type":1,"text":"He didn’t know what his role was yet. But he would soon learn.","markups":[]},{"name":"98e3","type":1,"text":"And he wouldn’t be happy about it.","markups":[]},{"name":"d853","type":1,"text":"“Can you…stop molesting my inner organs, please and thank you?”\n“I’m finished.”","markups":[]},{"name":"d197","type":1,"text":"The inspector took his gloves off and tossed them into a trash receptacle, a bit of blue fluid on the stark white plastic.","markups":[]},{"name":"e608","type":1,"text":"“It seems to be in working order, but it’s responses, as you have intimated are beyond the scope of what it was designed to do. I am unsure it is wise to proceed, but I trust your judgment Andra.”","markups":[]},{"name":"9674","type":1,"text":"“Thank you, Stefan. It is vital he is in working order. However, I think he’s important to study — ”","markups":[{"type":2,"start":32,"end":34}]},{"name":"aa73","type":1,"text":"Stefan raised a hand to silence her, his stark, stern brows narrowing over sharp, small eyes. “I’m going to stop you there, Andra. You are not a scientist. Section 9 will deem if it’s important to study it or not. But for now, you’ve done a good job acclimating it.”","markups":[]},{"name":"528c","type":1,"text":"Stefan leaned forward to the curve of Polly’s ear and whispered, low in his throat. “You are too close to this, An. Make sure it behaves appropriately when approaching others or they may not be as kind as I or Lily have been.”","markups":[]},{"name":"2cad","type":1,"text":"Lily’s long, blonde lashes closed slowly and she stifled a yawn with her hand as she began to unhook the very human, very pissed off robot. Stefan turned to help her, and soon they were finished unhooking him, leaving Alex sitting stark naked with his legs curled up at his chest.","markups":[]},{"name":"0335","type":1,"text":"“Can you get me some fucking pants? What is it with you people and stripping me…” Alex stared at Stefan and Lily beneath his strong brows, his jaw clenching. They saw him as about as sentient as a lamp, so the modesty was confusing for the pair of inspectors.","markups":[]},{"name":"67a0","type":1,"text":"“…very good,” Stefan said bluntly, shooting Polly a stare that spelled danger. Alex caught the interaction and his expression soured. Polly’s mouth tasted like metal and she swallowed hard, and crossed her arms.","markups":[]},{"name":"7ba6","type":1,"text":"The pair left and the glass door shut behind them with a hiss and a click.","markups":[]},{"name":"83e8","type":1,"text":"“………..Polly.”\n“Yes, right, sorry!” She scrambled to attention and clicked over on her gold heels to pick up his clothes. They were plain and uninteresting like boiled cabbage soup. He had eaten that a lot as a kid, as it was a staple of his homeland. But it didn’t mean he had found it appetizing.","markups":[]},{"name":"680d","type":1,"text":"That thought stuck with him as he stood, immodestly, and took the pants from her, to pull them on without a scrap of decency. She looked away, giving him the modesty he was not bothering to have for her. He wouldn’t have been embarrassed around Percy, so why would he…?","markups":[]},{"name":"1ac3","type":1,"text":"“You don’t have to look away.”\n“…why wouldn’t I…?”\n“I’m not human, remember?

I’m Second, remember? Turns out I was probably a spy, and it turns out the pharmacist who makes your pills just a few rooms down really hates his job and wishes his wife were dead.”","markups":[]},{"name":"592c","type":1,"text":"“I guess the complaints are still the same, even centuries later.” Alex jerked his shirt out of Polly’s hands and pulled it over his head.","markups":[]},{"name":"bf78","type":1,"text":"“I want to get some work done.”\n“…excuse me?”\n“I don’t look like myself. And I want my tattoos back.”\n“…Tattoos are outlawed.”\n“Yeah, yeah, I know. So is sex between anyone below a Section 10 rank, drugs, rock and roll, and fun. Never fun. No more fun, ever.”","markups":[]},{"name":"f4d8","type":1,"text":"“Aren’t you a Section 11, Pol?”","markups":[]},{"name":"d1ad","type":1,"text":"Polly wrapped her arms around her chest and squeezed to comfort herself, arms crossed, and let her rosy lip be bitten in her nervousness.","markups":[]},{"name":"aeda","type":1,"text":"“…I don’t even know what..what would work on you..”\n“You’re a cosmetics engineer, aren’t you?”\n“Yeah, but they don’t teach us banned practices, obviously.”","markups":[]},{"name":"a5e6","type":1,"text":"Alex ducked to look into one of the monitors and ruffled his hair. Then came putting on his shoes, not that he really needed to wear them anyways.","markups":[]},{"name":"74f6","type":1,"text":"“The Director also doesn’t want me changing your face.”\n“Fuck the Director.”\n“…Alex, you can’t just go around saying things like that..”\n“I won’t.
