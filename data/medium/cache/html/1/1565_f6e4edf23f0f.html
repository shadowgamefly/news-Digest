You have a problem with them around here?”</p><p name="8653" id="8653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— “No, it’s just like a tradition. For good luck”</p><p name="792b" id="792b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evil spirits are everywhere you look around here, and you have to acknowledge and salute them at all times or they’ll get you. Besides destroying the gaf in pig’s blood, every time you open an bottle of Empy you have to tip out a bit on the ground. That’s sharing it with the spirits I believe. Or if you go for a piss outside you have to ask them permission, just in case your actually watering their vegetables. I don’t know if they ever answer, but judging by the amount of outside pissing that goes on, they seem to be pretty cool with whatever.</p><h4 name="5202" id="5202" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Piss</h4><p name="00e4" id="00e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">My first while over here everyone was all interested every time I opened my mouth to speak. Everyone around would hush up and the listen in while the person I was speaking to would concentrate really hard and inevitably not understand what I was saying. Then they’d all have a sort of conference to see if they could figure out the message and soon there’d be this whole other conversation happening in a different language without me about what I’d said. So it was a bit embarrassing whenever I wanted to know where the jacks was. It was kind of like proclaiming my intention to everyone around, like I was expecting an applause or awed silence or something. I would always try to hold back and see where the other lads were going so I could discreetly follow in turn, but I could never manage it.</p><p name="5851" id="5851" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then one day it clicked. They weren’t going to the jacks at all. They were just heading outside to the nearest bush or bench or lamppost and having a blast. So the rule basically is, ask the gods and you can piss anywhere. And it’s not frowned upon, or thought of as unclassy either. You wouldn’t like, not piss because there were a few women around. Sometimes you don’t even need to find a bush. Lad’s will pull up at the side of the road, piss on the wheel of their truck, then drive off again. My mate Brendan thinks it’s great — kind of like being at a music festival all year round.</p><p name="d279" id="d279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The convenience is great, but one of the downsides of it is the inevitable smell that comes with it. It’s not ever-present, it’s not as if the whole country is stinking, but it’s always kind of a threat. You’ll be out doing some tourism, looking at a monument or an old church, thinking, “You know, this is actually quite cool. It looks good, it’s interesting, it’s not tacky…” Then bam! Bang of piss. And then you just think “Of course.”</p><p name="72fb" id="72fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So there is an upside and a downside, but in defence of the act, most jacks’ here don’t flush anyway.</p><h4 name="ddb1" id="ddb1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Jacks</strong></h4><p name="de63" id="de63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Sticking with piss for a second, there was one day here I went out to visit one of the sites where they were installing pumps. First, we had to visit the local Barangay Office in a little village called Manquiling. (Think the town hall in some backwater shithole like Bagnelstown or Belmullet or somewhere) It’s a place where they don’t usually get a lot of white people, so I was greeted a bit like a dignitary — loads of random people came over for a gawk at me, I had to shake everyone’s hands, sit at the top of the table beside the chairman, that sort of thing. Anyway, after about an hour of observing everyone’s movements and having no idea where to go, I had to discreetly ask where the ‘comfort room’ was. So after the usual conference between about a dozen people, I was eventually, very publicly, led to the jacks.</p><p name="2bb4" id="2bb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which was all fine. I was starting to get used to being the centre of attention, despite my best efforts. Anyway, I did what I was supposed to do and went to flush… No water. Flushed again. No water again… and the handle broke off in my hand. And not just fell out so I could skilfully replace it and and leave it for the next poor fucker to get the blame. The plastic snapped and it came off in my hand. There was no way to fix it without a roll of gaffer tape or DeLorean with a flux capacitor, neither of which were close at hand. (Actually, the electricity was out all day too, which is probably why there was no water) On top of that, this was pretty early in the morning, and things were, let’s just say, aromatic. Orange and aromatic. I’d a quick look in the cistern to see could I MacGyver my way out of total embarrassment, but in the end I just left and said nothing. I’m sure they were devastated when they discovered it. It’s not quite the Queen of England coming over for tea and leaving skid marks all over the bowl, but it’s along those lines.</p><p name="21a0" id="21a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So that’s why it’s often better to whizz outside in the begonias than the comfort room. You just can’t trust the plumbing. I’ve since learned that a properly flushing jacks is quite the anomaly over here. It’s not like it never happens, or that when it does it makes the national news, it’s more like, say an eclipse. It happens every now and again and you think, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Oh, that’s nice”</em>. Then you try and remember the last time it happened and you think, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Jesus, has it been that long?” </em>The standard way to flush is actually to gather a bucket of water and pour it manually into the bowl. In most bathrooms there is barrel of water with a scoop or a smaller bucket and you just fill it up and tip it in until things return to the state they were in beforehand.</p><h4 name="d477" id="d477" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Celebrity Status</strong></h4><p name="3049" id="3049" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’m not, as has been established, the Queen of England, but I can’t help feeling like a bit of a celebrity every now and then. Not a real celebrity now. Maybe like one of the shite ones of the first series of Big Brother, who had a fleeting career in TV for a year or 2 afterwards. Bacolod, the city where I’m based, is not all that nice a place really. It’s grand like; friendly, relatively safe, small enough to get around if you understand the system, but there is fuck all to do at the best of times. No beach, no parks, no tourist attractions, no culture really. So there aren’t a lot of white people around who aren’t alcoholic priests or geriatric American sex-tourists.</p><p name="e0fb" id="e0fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I get a lot of funny looks. Like, people will sort of stare at me when they think I’m not looking, like they recognise me from somewhere but can’t quite place it, and then look away quickly when I look back. Or they blatantly stare straight at me and look even more confused when I return the look. That’s mostly adults. Kids will actually say something but mostly it’s just one will fire out some phrase they know in English and then the whole group will fall around laughing. And it doesn’t even have to make sense. It’ll be like “Awesome dude”, or “Hey man” or “I love you”. As long as it’s English. Teenagers just ignore me cos they’re cunts the world over. It’s nice that that doesn’t change.</p><p name="6b5a" id="6b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Besides them though, everyone else is usually pretty friendly in fairness. I’ll often just say hello to randomers or give a wink to some lad who is absent-mindedly staring at me with his gob open and mostly everyone will smile back, regardless of how rough or intimidating they look beforehand.</p><p name="f4a2" id="f4a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s actually one of the least intimidating countries I’ve been to. I keep getting warned to be careful, and maybe I’m being naive, but I just don’t see it. The people just don’t seem to have any hostility or defensiveness in them like you get in other places. Now there is every chance that this is just the current situation I’m in and I’m about to get robbed blind one of these days just for saying it, but that’s my current evaluation anyway.</p><h4 name="964b" id="964b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Acting the maggot</strong></h4><p name="862e" id="862e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In fact there is a bit of a lack of seriousness here altogether. I was at some random christening a while back, which was basically a standard lunch with a few beers afterwards. A game of ball started up and, as usual, when you have a basketball and a table of drinks, one went crashing into the other. Drinks everywhere, people soaked, kids screaming. Everyone just pissed themselves laughing. I can imagine that happening at home and my Dad would probably burst the ball. Not one person thought anything was out of order, and the game and the drinking carried on just as enthusiastically as before.</p><p name="1ab3" id="1ab3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is a good thing. People are easy going, quick to laugh and generally fairly happy about things. On the other hand, this could well be why the place is generally a bit of a shambles but I’ll leave that for another discussion.</p><h4 name="007d" id="007d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Offical Events</h4><p name="c2cf" id="c2cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Despite the easy-going and light-heartedness of that days events, pretty much at 6pm on the dot everyone packed up and left. This is the norm for most official events, which is very different from Ireland. At home, if you’re drinking, your drinking till the end. Nobody even questioned it, it was like the lights going on in a nightclub. I was reluctantly invited to a wedding the other week, and not reluctantly as in they didn’t really want me to attend, reluctantly as in:</p><p name="33e1" id="33e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-“Do you want to go to a wedding? It’s going to be shit.”</p><p name="4599" id="4599" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-“Shit like how?”</p><p name="3989" id="3989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-“Well there’s a ceremony in the church then there’s a lunch and some talking and then that’s it.”</p><p name="8763" id="8763" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-“That’s it? You mean you don’t turn up hungover in your best suit, get fucke-eyed on free champagne and an empty stomach, cover your tie in the gravy and your shirt in guinness and somehow end up mentioning blow-jobs to the brides mother? And then have a day 2 of it?”</p><p name="bf0e" id="bf0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apparently not. Your standard wedding is shite craic here. Apparently the only difference between a wedding and a standard Sunday is spaghetti.</p><h4 name="d74b" id="d74b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Spaghetti</h4><p name="5cc7" id="5cc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Spaghetti is a food for a special occasion here. Like weddings, birthdays etc. Kind of like how we might have cake. Specifically, it is a big tray of spaghetti, covered in tomato sauce with a tiny amount of chorizo chopped up into it. Nobody can explain why this is special event food. It’s just tradition.</p><h4 name="4b1f" id="4b1f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Superstitions</h4><p name="fde3" id="fde3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Getting back to superstitions, the spaghetti thing may have something to do with a superstition they have regarding spaghetti and noodles. Apparently if you eat long noodles, you’ll have a long life, but if you chop them up to make them smaller and easier to eat like you would for a 5 year old child, or me, then you’ll have a short life. Same goes for spaghetti. (This connection between this food and the events is just a theory I made up myself. It could be totally wrong but I have an awful habit of wanting to know why people do strange things)</p><p name="2717" id="2717" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other superstitions include, sleeping with your feet facing the door means you’re going to die. Also, singing the song ‘My Way’ by Frank Sinatra means you’re going to die. I’m not sure how much if this is actual superstition, or maybe they’re just filling me with crap like when we tell American’s about leprechauns or that there is no such things as Wednesdays in Ireland. But if all this is to be believed, between noodles and sleeping the wrong way and decorating your house in pig’s blood, it seems to me that they’re living every day in mortal danger. And in that case it’s maybe no wonder that they don’t give a shit about spilt drinks or driving safely or things like that. They’re in mortal danger at all times. It’s hard to know for sure though cos no one can properly explain it to me.</p><h4 name="bf43" id="bf43" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Information</h4><p name="3a29" id="3a29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Getting information here, from anyone, about anything is fuckin impossible.

So when this is a thing that people do, you can’t actually trust what anyone says as fact. I try to ask numerous people the same question and see if there is a general consensus.

Besides destroying the gaf in pig’s blood, every time you open an bottle of Empy you have to tip out a bit on the ground. That’s sharing it with the spirits I believe. Or if you go for a piss outside you have to ask them permission, just in case your actually watering their vegetables. I don’t know if they ever answer, but judging by the amount of outside pissing that goes on, they seem to be pretty cool with whatever.","markups":[]},{"name":"5202","type":13,"text":"Piss","markups":[]},{"name":"00e4","type":1,"text":"My first while over here everyone was all interested every time I opened my mouth to speak. Everyone around would hush up and the listen in while the person I was speaking to would concentrate really hard and inevitably not understand what I was saying. Then they’d all have a sort of conference to see if they could figure out the message and soon there’d be this whole other conversation happening in a different language without me about what I’d said. So it was a bit embarrassing whenever I wanted to know where the jacks was. It was kind of like proclaiming my intention to everyone around, like I was expecting an applause or awed silence or something. I would always try to hold back and see where the other lads were going so I could discreetly follow in turn, but I could never manage it.","markups":[]},{"name":"5851","type":1,"text":"Then one day it clicked. They weren’t going to the jacks at all. They were just heading outside to the nearest bush or bench or lamppost and having a blast. So the rule basically is, ask the gods and you can piss anywhere. And it’s not frowned upon, or thought of as unclassy either. You wouldn’t like, not piss because there were a few women around. Sometimes you don’t even need to find a bush. Lad’s will pull up at the side of the road, piss on the wheel of their truck, then drive off again. My mate Brendan thinks it’s great — kind of like being at a music festival all year round.","markups":[]},{"name":"d279","type":1,"text":"The convenience is great, but one of the downsides of it is the inevitable smell that comes with it. It’s not ever-present, it’s not as if the whole country is stinking, but it’s always kind of a threat. You’ll be out doing some tourism, looking at a monument or an old church, thinking, “You know, this is actually quite cool. It looks good, it’s interesting, it’s not tacky…” Then bam! Bang of piss. And then you just think “Of course.”","markups":[]},{"name":"72fb","type":1,"text":"So there is an upside and a downside, but in defence of the act, most jacks’ here don’t flush anyway.","markups":[]},{"name":"ddb1","type":13,"text":"Jacks","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":5}]},{"name":"de63","type":1,"text":"Sticking with piss for a second, there was one day here I went out to visit one of the sites where they were installing pumps. First, we had to visit the local Barangay Office in a little village called Manquiling. (Think the town hall in some backwater shithole like Bagnelstown or Belmullet or somewhere) It’s a place where they don’t usually get a lot of white people, so I was greeted a bit like a dignitary — loads of random people came over for a gawk at me, I had to shake everyone’s hands, sit at the top of the table beside the chairman, that sort of thing. Anyway, after about an hour of observing everyone’s movements and having no idea where to go, I had to discreetly ask where the ‘comfort room’ was. So after the usual conference between about a dozen people, I was eventually, very publicly, led to the jacks.","markups":[]},{"name":"2bb4","type":1,"text":"Which was all fine. I was starting to get used to being the centre of attention, despite my best efforts. Anyway, I did what I was supposed to do and went to flush… No water. Flushed again. No water again… and the handle broke off in my hand. And not just fell out so I could skilfully replace it and and leave it for the next poor fucker to get the blame. The plastic snapped and it came off in my hand. There was no way to fix it without a roll of gaffer tape or DeLorean with a flux capacitor, neither of which were close at hand. (Actually, the electricity was out all day too, which is probably why there was no water) On top of that, this was pretty early in the morning, and things were, let’s just say, aromatic. Orange and aromatic. I’d a quick look in the cistern to see could I MacGyver my way out of total embarrassment, but in the end I just left and said nothing. I’m sure they were devastated when they discovered it. It’s not quite the Queen of England coming over for tea and leaving skid marks all over the bowl, but it’s along those lines.","markups":[]},{"name":"21a0","type":1,"text":"So that’s why it’s often better to whizz outside in the begonias than the comfort room. You just can’t trust the plumbing. I’ve since learned that a properly flushing jacks is quite the anomaly over here. It’s not like it never happens, or that when it does it makes the national news, it’s more like, say an eclipse. It happens every now and again and you think, “Oh, that’s nice”. Then you try and remember the last time it happened and you think, “Jesus, has it been that long?” The standard way to flush is actually to gather a bucket of water and pour it manually into the bowl. In most bathrooms there is barrel of water with a scoop or a smaller bucket and you just fill it up and tip it in until things return to the state they were in beforehand.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":364,"end":381,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""},{"type":2,"start":450,"end":482,"href":"","title":"","rel":"","name":"","anchorType":0,"creatorIds":[],"userId":""}]},{"name":"d477","type":13,"text":"Celebrity Status","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":16}]},{"name":"3049","type":1,"text":"I’m not, as has been established, the Queen of England, but I can’t help feeling like a bit of a celebrity every now and then. Not a real celebrity now. Maybe like one of the shite ones of the first series of Big Brother, who had a fleeting career in TV for a year or 2 afterwards. Bacolod, the city where I’m based, is not all that nice a place really. It’s grand like; friendly, relatively safe, small enough to get around if you understand the system, but there is fuck all to do at the best of times. No beach, no parks, no tourist attractions, no culture really. So there aren’t a lot of white people around who aren’t alcoholic priests or geriatric American sex-tourists.","markups":[]},{"name":"e0fb","type":1,"text":"So I get a lot of funny looks. Like, people will sort of stare at me when they think I’m not looking, like they recognise me from somewhere but can’t quite place it, and then look away quickly when I look back. Or they blatantly stare straight at me and look even more confused when I return the look. That’s mostly adults. Kids will actually say something but mostly it’s just one will fire out some phrase they know in English and then the whole group will fall around laughing. And it doesn’t even have to make sense. It’ll be like “Awesome dude”, or “Hey man” or “I love you”. As long as it’s English. Teenagers just ignore me cos they’re cunts the world over. It’s nice that that doesn’t change.","markups":[]},{"name":"6b5a","type":1,"text":"Besides them though, everyone else is usually pretty friendly in fairness.

I was at some random christening a while back, which was basically a standard lunch with a few beers afterwards. A game of ball started up and, as usual, when you have a basketball and a table of drinks, one went crashing into the other. Drinks everywhere, people soaked, kids screaming. Everyone just pissed themselves laughing. I can imagine that happening at home and my Dad would probably burst the ball.

Same goes for spaghetti. (This connection between this food and the events is just a theory I made up myself. It could be totally wrong but I have an awful habit of wanting to know why people do strange things)","markups":[]},{"name":"2717","type":1,"text":"Other superstitions include, sleeping with your feet facing the door means you’re going to die. Also, singing the song ‘My Way’ by Frank Sinatra means you’re going to die. I’m not sure how much if this is actual superstition, or maybe they’re just filling me with crap like when we tell American’s about leprechauns or that there is no such things as Wednesdays in Ireland. But if all this is to be believed, between noodles and sleeping the wrong way and decorating your house in pig’s blood, it seems to me that they’re living every day in mortal danger. And in that case it’s maybe no wonder that they don’t give a shit about spilt drinks or driving safely or things like that. They’re in mortal danger at all times.
