A lot can happen in three days…..or NOT! We left San Angelo and headed for Marathon on Monday (Jan 9) morning. At some point, we exited from the Interstate highway and were going to take a secondary road, which looked to be the most direct route (and probably was). However, our gas tank was nearing the 1/4 tank mark, and we have discovered that a FULL tank is only good for about 450 km ….. or about 270 miles, so knew we needed to gas up soon. I suggested we go to the town (13 miles out of our way) that indicated a hospital, because logically it would be more likely to have gas than the small town we would go through on our chosen route. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“No, that is too far out of our way, of course there will be gas in the next town on our route which is also 13 miles away….but in the right direction.”</em>, says He! We arrived at the next small town and without a word of a lie…..it appeared to be a ghost town! The only gas station in town was pretty much boarded up. One lonely soul (probably a ghost) was walking down the road so we asked him about a gas station. “No sir, there isn’t any gas here….you’d have to drive to that town 30 miles in the opposite direction.” Hmmmmm……what was that you said Doug?<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> “I said you were right again, Louise!”</em></p><p name="c416" id="c416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We made it to the little town of Marathon via a different route.</p><figure name="c7ca" id="c7ca" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oAgXLfOJ5fPlBA4ljYc9pA.jpeg" data-width="4000" data-height="3000" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*oAgXLfOJ5fPlBA4ljYc9pA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oAgXLfOJ5fPlBA4ljYc9pA.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="66a7" id="66a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The plan was to buy groceries, fill up with water and start the ‘camping’ part of our adventure. Marathon has one grocery/convenience store called The French Grocer. Not somewhere that you can stock up on groceries, as most of the produce was shrivelled up….and the prices were crazy. So we bought bread, 1/2 pound of butter, a package of smoked turkey, a few beer, water and some milk. A real bargain at $57. Drove up the road and found a nice little RV park with hookups and proceeded to set up for our first sleep in the Rig. A nice neighbour gave us a few pointers, we ate cereal for supper and cozied up for the night. Other than 4 freight trains blowing whistles and rattling along the tracks (which we hadn’t noticed were directly across the road), we both had a good night.</p><p name="7300" id="7300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">January 10th…Tuesday morning, we headed to the little town of Alpine, just 30 miles down the road. Had a lovely lunch in The Old Holland Hotel but there was a piece of plastic inside Doug’s delicious burger. No problemo ….. no charge for lunch!! (Should have kept that little piece of plastic for future freebies! Just Kidding!!)</p><p name="100b" id="100b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Found a real grocery store…..and a MUSEUM! Life is good. A gentleman at the grocery store told us about an RV Park in town called The Lost Alaskan. A nice quiet evening to sit and read. I tried to get online to do this little blog, but gave up on the connection. I read the Motorhome Manual instead.</p><figure name="65cc" id="65cc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OmLLRw9VrPVmTp0-m1c-9Q.jpeg" data-width="4000" data-height="3000" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*OmLLRw9VrPVmTp0-m1c-9Q.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OmLLRw9VrPVmTp0-m1c-9Q.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="b825" id="b825" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Today is Wednesday, January 11th. Our nice little RV park had showers!! So nice after a day without! For some reason we were only given one key to our little Rig and so I waited 20 minutes outside the men’s shower room while Doug was talking to some guy in there who is also writing a blog. Perhaps I will check it out….it is called ‘Travels with Rover’.</p><p name="4078" id="4078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">En route this a.m. I was party to a lecture on plutons. Very interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluton" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluton</a></p><p name="d6cc" id="d6cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have only been on the road for 6 days, and here we are in Big Bend Park, right next to the Rio Grande River. The drive in to this park is breathtaking with desert and mountains colliding! The colour of some of the exposed cliffs is awesome! No boring scenery here. This area was once covered by water and is one of the richest deposits of fossils and dinosaur bones in the world. Tomorrow we will hike and I will take photos while Doug explains the different rocks and fossils to me. We are in a campground with no hookups, so are using lights from the solar powered battery. We may not be able to have lights on for too long.</p><p name="90a0" id="90a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The little Rig is comfy, but small. We don’t feel like putting the bed away now that we have it made up so we have 2 seating options…..one person sits on the passenger seat that swivels toward the living area….the other sits/lies on the bed. Good thing we brought extra pillows to lean against.</p><p name="3283" id="3283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today’s highlight, besides the scenery, is that Doug barbecued the pork chops!! YES, REALLY …… and they were perfect! It was a bit primitive because we had to use briquettes in a little BBQ thingy they supply here in the park. No open fires….makes sense in a desert I guess!</p><p name="96a6" id="96a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The weather is amazingly hot, the scenery amazingly cool, and to top it all off….there are ROAD RUNNERS….the bird we used to watch on TV Cartoons……meep meep!</p><figure name="7d72" id="7d72" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1I7RoQqfbg3FA6l8vzCwNA.jpeg" data-width="1638" data-height="1229" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*1I7RoQqfbg3FA6l8vzCwNA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1I7RoQqfbg3FA6l8vzCwNA.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="d47b" id="d47b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">January 12th! Happy Birthday to our good buddy Ron McCrae! It’s another scorcher here in Big Bend. We had an amazing sleep last night….temps are 30 degrees in the daytime and dip down to about 5 overnight. A big full moon, clear skies and stars twinkling in the heavens….ahhhhh…does life get better than this?</p><p name="b62c" id="b62c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Went for 2 hikes today. One was about 45 minutes up to a lookout. Had to change the batteries in the camera because I have been snapping like crazy! Second hike was also a good climb up, then descent to the Rio Grande Canyon! OH MY! I need another word for awesome! Across the river (maybe 200 metres) there was a Mexican singing in Spanish. A beautiful echo rang out in the canyon. We hiked a few more metres and came upon a cup with money in it and a request to pay the Spanish serenader whose name just happened to be Jesus! Still looking for Elvis!</p><p name="b0fa" id="b0fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a lovely young couple hiking along with us and by the end of the trek we were BESTIES…..served them chilled water from our fridge and stood in the shade of our awning in the parking lot.</p><figure name="fe3e" id="fe3e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nrZMjMpfAbGW89NQpk1AOQ.jpeg" data-width="3264" data-height="2448" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*nrZMjMpfAbGW89NQpk1AOQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nrZMjMpfAbGW89NQpk1AOQ.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="a37f" id="a37f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We were so warm that we decided to have an afternoon shower at the store….the only place in the park with showers. $2 for 5 minutes. It felt wonderful! We are still sitting here trying to charge up the MacBook so I can play with my photos. It will be hard to edit, as I am sure I have taken 7 or 8 pics of everything I see.</p><p name="8b5a" id="8b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">January 13th…Ahhhh it is Friday today. Friday the 13th! Our lucky day! We hit the road early today (9 am is early for us) and headed to a new campsite in the park called Cottonwood. It was a bit foggy in the Chisos Mountains, so we opted out of one scenic adventure we may have taken, but managed to make several stops to assuage Doug’s plaque attack needs. At one stop, Doug said, “Give me the camera, I want to get your picture! Here, put your face down into this cactus.” Stupidly, I knelt down on the sharp crushed rock and tried to shove my face into the cactus for this creative photo! Doug stands looking into the camera display and after a minute or two announces, “No….I don’t think I took a photo”. Onward….</p><p name="4df1" id="4df1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luckily, we arrived at the campground in time to snatch up one of the 2 empty sites available…..marked our territory with lawn chairs and took off to find a few hiking trails that Doug had read about. It’s good, we are getting our exercise mountain climbing! one of our 3 hikes was about a mile long (not too difficult a climb up to see the remnants of two old homesteads nestled atop a hill surrounded by these incredibly beautiful mountains and valleys. Then we drove on to the Santa Elena Canyon ‘where limestone cliffs rise 1500 feet above the Rio Grande River’. A pretty steep climb for we two old farts, but well worth it. The view down the canyon was spectacular! (we only climbed about 300 feet!!)</p><figure name="6e05" id="6e05" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dGhSq0YEbiUU5n8IqBUrRw.jpeg" data-width="3264" data-height="2448" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*dGhSq0YEbiUU5n8IqBUrRw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dGhSq0YEbiUU5n8IqBUrRw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="f42a" id="f42a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It is 6 pm and we are all set up under our awning.

We pulled up camp and headed North out of Big Bend this am. Some pretty steep mountain passes. I have never been a great passenger…..ask anyone who has had the pleasure of having me sit next to them in a car! The cliffs were making me a tad nervous….and, well…..Doug likes to look at things when he is driving! He was actually doing fine, multi tasking with the driving and the looking, but I was not a quiet, calm person. I was not looking at the scenery….I was watching the road and fidgeting. Finally I suggested that I should drive so he could enjoy the beautiful views. So, at the next plaque attack….Lou takes the wheel. You have to understand that this was the first time that I was behind the wheel of this lovely 20&#39; RV. What ever was I thinking???? I thought that I would be less nervous driving!! NOT!!!! But, I did manage to get us up and down a few pretty steep switch backs and yes, it is good that there is so little traffic on those roads at this time of year! At the next pullout I was happy to return the DRIVING WHEEL to my chauffeur. BREATHE, LOUISE…..BREATHE!!</p><p name="550b" id="550b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We stopped at an interesting little ghost town Terlingua. There was an incredibly old cemetery there and wandering around in it was so spiritual.</p><figure name="02f7" id="02f7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vb2kVcYiS2Hc3I2hFO0-zw.jpeg" data-width="4000" data-height="3000" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*vb2kVcYiS2Hc3I2hFO0-zw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vb2kVcYiS2Hc3I2hFO0-zw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="741f" id="741f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We then had lunch in such a quaint little hotel &amp; golf club nearby, before continuing on our merry way to Marfa! Someone in the Tourist Information Booth when we entered Texas told us what a neat little town it was, and how so many artists have moved into the area and fixed it up. Well, it is true that there are a few interesting buildings there, but frankly, we were disappointed in what we found. Even more so when we could not find a campsite where we could stop and spend the night. We were getting tired and hungry, but there was no where to go so we carried on to Fort Davis, TX. Pulled into a not so very nice spot, but it was better than nothing and the weather was starting to get a bit ugly. We had supper and went to bed early, listening to the patter of rain and the rumbles of thunder.</p><p name="2f5d" id="2f5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This post is getting

A lot can happen in three days…..or NOT! We left San Angelo and headed for Marathon on Monday (Jan 9) morning. At some point, we exited from the Interstate highway and were going to take a secondary road, which looked to be the most direct route (and probably was). However, our gas tank was nearing the 1/4 tank mark, and we have discovered that a FULL tank is only good for about 450 km ….. or about 270 miles, so knew we needed to gas up soon. I suggested we go to the town (13 miles out of our way) that indicated a hospital, because logically it would be more likely to have gas than the small town we would go through on our chosen route. “No, that is too far out of our way, of course there will be gas in the next town on our route which is also 13 miles away….but in the right direction.”, says He! We arrived at the next small town and without a word of a lie…..it appeared to be a ghost town! The only gas station in town was pretty much boarded up. One lonely soul (probably a ghost) was walking down the road so we asked him about a gas station. “No sir, there isn’t any gas here….you’d have to drive to that town 30 miles in the opposite direction.” Hmmmmm……what was that you said Doug? “I said you were right again, Louise!”","markups":[{"type":2,"start":739,"end":891},{"type":2,"start":1294,"end":1333}]},{"name":"c416","type":1,"text":"We made it to the little town of Marathon via a different route.","markups":[]},{"name":"c7ca","type":4,"text":"","markups":[],"layout":1,"metadata":{"id":"1*oAgXLfOJ5fPlBA4ljYc9pA.jpeg","originalWidth":4000,"originalHeight":3000}},{"name":"66a7","type":1,"text":"The plan was to buy groceries, fill up with water and start the ‘camping’ part of our adventure. Marathon has one grocery/convenience store called The French Grocer. Not somewhere that you can stock up on groceries, as most of the produce was shrivelled up….and the prices were crazy. So we bought bread, 1/2 pound of butter, a package of smoked turkey, a few beer, water and some milk. A real bargain at $57. Drove up the road and found a nice little RV park with hookups and proceeded to set up for our first sleep in the Rig. A nice neighbour gave us a few pointers, we ate cereal for supper and cozied up for the night. Other than 4 freight trains blowing whistles and rattling along the tracks (which we hadn’t noticed were directly across the road), we both had a good night.","markups":[]},{"name":"7300","type":1,"text":"January 10th…Tuesday morning, we headed to the little town of Alpine, just 30 miles down the road.

The drive in to this park is breathtaking with desert and mountains colliding! The colour of some of the exposed cliffs is awesome! No boring scenery here. This area was once covered by water and is one of the richest deposits of fossils and dinosaur bones in the world. Tomorrow we will hike and I will take photos while Doug explains the different rocks and fossils to me. We are in a campground with no hookups, so are using lights from the solar powered battery. We may not be able to have lights on for too long.","markups":[]},{"name":"90a0","type":1,"text":"The little Rig is comfy, but small.

A beautiful echo rang out in the canyon. We hiked a few more metres and came upon a cup with money in it and a request to pay the Spanish serenader whose name just happened to be Jesus!

Our lucky day! We hit the road early today (9 am is early for us) and headed to a new campsite in the park called Cottonwood. It was a bit foggy in the Chisos Mountains, so we opted out of one scenic adventure we may have taken, but managed to make several stops to assuage Doug’s plaque attack needs. At one stop, Doug said, “Give me the camera, I want to get your picture! Here, put your face down into this cactus.” Stupidly, I knelt down on the sharp crushed rock and tried to shove my face into the cactus for this creative photo! Doug stands looking into the camera display and after a minute or two announces, “No….I don’t think I took a photo”. Onward….","markups":[]},{"name":"4df1","type":1,"text":"Luckily, we arrived at the campground in time to snatch up one of the 2 empty sites available…..marked our territory with lawn chairs and took off to find a few hiking trails that Doug had read about.

Then we drove on to the Santa Elena Canyon ‘where limestone cliffs rise 1500 feet above the Rio Grande River’. A pretty steep climb for we two old farts, but well worth it.

Some pretty steep mountain passes. I have never been a great passenger…..ask anyone who has had the pleasure of having me sit next to them in a car! The cliffs were making me a tad nervous….and, well…..Doug likes to look at things when he is driving! He was actually doing fine, multi tasking with the driving and the looking, but I was not a quiet, calm person. I was not looking at the scenery….I was watching the road and fidgeting. Finally I suggested that I should drive so he could enjoy the beautiful views. So, at the next plaque attack….Lou takes the wheel. You have to understand that this was the first time that I was behind the wheel of this lovely 20' RV. What ever was I thinking???? I thought that I would be less nervous driving!! NOT!!!! But, I did manage to get us up and down a few pretty steep switch backs and yes, it is good that there is so little traffic on those roads at this time of year!

Well, it is true that there are a few interesting buildings there, but frankly, we were disappointed in what we found. Even more so when we could not find a campsite where we could stop and spend the night. We were getting tired and hungry, but there was no where to go so we carried on to Fort Davis, TX. Pulled into a not so very nice spot, but it was better than nothing and the weather was starting to get a bit ugly.
