But alas.</p><p name="a6c9" id="a6c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve spent the better part of the past two decades researching and writing on the question of why we single out college athletes as undeserving of the basic American right to economic freedom. From this, I have decided that the correct question is not, “Should college athletes be paid?” but instead, “Why are we letting the colleges that form the NCAA act as a price-fixing <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/files/02_1209_monopoly_bw.pdf" data-href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/files/02_1209_monopoly_bw.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cartel</a> rather than recognizing the rights of the college athletes they exploit?”</p><p name="673a" id="673a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I ask the question this way, the usual response is, “Exploited? You call getting ‘free’ college exploitation? I wish I (or my kid) could be exploited like that!” (This is <a href="http://sportsgeekonomics.tumblr.com/post/13848652399/myth-10-what-they-get-is-very-valuable-it-should" data-href="http://sportsgeekonomics.tumblr.com/post/13848652399/myth-10-what-they-get-is-very-valuable-it-should" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Myth 10</a> on my list of phony excuses for not paying college athletes.)</p><p name="61f2" id="61f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a sense that athletes are less deserving of this largesse than “real” students. People focus on the value of what athletes get rather than on the value they are denied. I often hear that “they” should be grateful for what they’ve been “given,” disregarding that the “gift” is a fraction of their market worth, built on a foundation that denies them the right to earn their worth like everyone else.</p><p name="ddf6" id="ddf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When others in society gets a raise, we rarely ask whether he or she “needed” it — we accept it as how a capitalist society rewards good results. But when a college athlete asks for more than just having his/her expenses covered, we apply the standard we use for children—and not even our own children, but other people’s children, for poor people’s children. Why should they get anything more than they need just to get by?</p></div></div></section><section name="efad" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="33fc" id="33fc" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">College athletes, who enrich our fall Saturdays and provide the madness every March, should get more than just sustenance. They should get more than your kid does. Why? Because in America, we’re supposed to get what we’re worth, and we’re supposed to get it through the workings of the free market. If a recruit is worth 100 letters a day, if he is worth investing in a $70 million luxury palace of a locker room, and if he is so valuable that his coaches earn $10 million to make sure he signs that letter of intent, then he is worth more than just his scholarship. He doesn’t earn more solely because the teams that value him most — the 351 programs in NCAA’s Division I — have formed a price-fixing agreement for the purpose of denying these men (<a href="http://deadspin.com/don-t-let-anyone-tell-you-the-o-bannon-ruling-conflicts-1620712195" data-href="http://deadspin.com/don-t-let-anyone-tell-you-the-o-bannon-ruling-conflicts-1620712195" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">and women</a>) access to the same market forces that have allowed college sports revenues to grow at a rate far faster than the American economy as a whole.
