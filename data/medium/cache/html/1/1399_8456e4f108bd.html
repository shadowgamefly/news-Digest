I tried to remember what he had looked like before all this.</p><p name="36d1" id="36d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He used to have thick strawberry blonde hair that he brushed leftwards, it looked strange now, being so bare and exposed. I should have looked away, but instead I stared, hoping to make sense of it all. His eyelashes and eyebrows were still there, lightly colored and hard to see, but they remained the same. He explained that it was a myth that you lose those early on because they are slow growing hairs, unlike the ones on his head. But more than just hair changes, he had aged. He looked wiser and somehow more qualified to tell me what dying feels like.</p><p name="06b5" id="06b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tried to process the impending reality while I hid my fear with smiles and long gazes of pity–I was fucking up, but I couldn’t help it.

But no one else is there watching because you’re alone in a room watching life deteriorate rapidly. So you go outside, seeking other people who are running around crying, unsure of what they have seen, unsure of what will happen to the world after this tragedy unravels. But all you see is people living their lives; walking their dogs and drinking their coffee. People headed to work stressed over stock prices and marital issues; people just going on as if the world isn’t ending because for them it isn’t.

Unaware or uninterested of my opinion on the topic. He told me about the shape of the cup that he was meant to finish in, but couldn’t. He told me about the ways the doctors manipulated him and touched him as if he was just an inanimate object, almost causing the feeling of touch to become mundane and unexciting. He talked to me as if he wanted to unleash the side of cancer most never think about.</p><p name="a8be" id="a8be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere between discussions on chemo and surgery, a bottle of pear flavored sake arrived.</p><p name="018d" id="018d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I ordered some so we could toast to cancer, why the hell not, am I right?</em>” he asked.</p><p name="d87c" id="d87c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why the<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> hell</em> not,” I declared as I tried to read his eyes.</p><p name="7fdf" id="7fdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We danced around each other’s feelings in awkward moments of poorly timed jokes and forced laughter, much like how we did when we first met.

She had instructed me to come visit on a day when “the guy who is totally my type” was working.

He was far more handsome than she described. He was tall and thin, donned in a flannel shirt, wearing vintage glasses that drew me to his azure pigmented eyes. His beard was reddish, a color darker than his hair. He had a strong jaw and a short beard that nearly masked it. His face was kind, yet almost stoic, like a beautiful painting I wanted to touch.</p><p name="09da" id="09da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I left the store with a new phone and an invitation for a drink with the blue eyed salesman. Though it was unbeknown to me at the time, we began the best relationship I ever had. Kevin would visit me at my brewery job every weekend, waiting in a booth with an IPA and the New York Times in hand. He came to my house when my family lost power during Hurricane Sandy to bring me gluten free snacks and red wine. Another time, after a particularly long shift at work, he showed up just to bring me a leather bound notebook so I could write because he knew how much I loved it. Kevin was the best thing that ever happened to me in ways that I didn’t realize until I had ended things in order to go to graduate school. He was moving to New York and I eventually moved to Washington, DC. It seemed logical, but somehow I never let go of him completely. He was consistently the man I always referenced– the baseline of how I should be treated or how someone should act. He was the benchmark of whom I wanted to share my life with, but I always felt too scared to ever ask if he’d be willing to fulfill such a request.</p><p name="87cc" id="87cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We remained distant and cordial friends through social media and birthday texts, but I always yearned for more. And so two years after my mistake to sever what we had cultivated, I sat across from him haunted by not only my decision, but by the reality of his health. I felt saddened, confused, angry, the feelings incapacitated my heart as I sat swirling my straw and faking smiles at him. I wanted to to tell him what I had hid, the feelings I had suppressed but somehow had bubbled to the surface as the timer seemed to ring . . .

I needed to figure it out, but I didn’t know where to go in my mind, I couldn’t even put one thought in logical order, it all felt like falling in love with him again–messy and fucking terrifying. It was like throwing my heart back into the ring and knowing it wasn’t coming back unscathed.</p><p name="b8e4" id="b8e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I just observed him, like an art piece, smiling and absorbing all I could with my eyes– I knew I couldn’t touch it, but only look from afar. He was this entity I could admire because everything about him made me happy, just by being close to him. I loved the way he made faces when I talked about annoying people or the way he listened to me without ever interrupting. I loved the freckles that decorated his nose. He was whole and finished, he was a symbol of perfection, but he was dying.</p><p name="f151" id="f151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything about the fluorescent lit room reminded me of being home.

He looked young again, grinning proudly as he went to hug me. He looked happy, unfathomably happy. It felt as if the cancer never happened. His wrinkle-less eggshell colored shirt enticed me to finally tell him the truth “So, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can we start over?

He almost died in the ICU due to complications that occurred, but against everything, he lived. Eventually, he went back to work full time, received a promotion at his job and moved to Brooklyn and started a new relationship. I had went back to school the summer he got the surgery. I kept in touch, sent a five pound package of gummy bears and wrote him often. Over that year, I kept my promise. Kevin didn’t know how I still felt and he never would because he had endured enough.

I kept staring at it, obsessing over every detail I couldn’t see, my mind raced. It felt like a loss I hadn’t prepared.</p><p name="7264" id="7264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was jealous of her in a way, she got to meet him now, when he was ready, after he had been young, idealistic, broken, then horribly sick.

But, what I hated most was that I could never tell him how I felt because I knew that no beautiful string of words mustered together would change what had already occurred–what had already formed our current lives. As if he could feel my discomfort, he assured me that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">they</em> weren’t serious; he explained that his new fling was merely a consequence of internet convenience and proximity. But, I heard the readiness in his tone. This was the opportunity he wished for in the hospital room, but instead of a motorcycle, he opted for a one speed bike and a normal life in New York.</p><p name="6698" id="6698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat on my side of the booth, hands at my side and yearned to tell him things I should have said long ago, but refrained.

Long ago was a hospital room and now was a future he never thought he’d have. Our memories were haunting yet gloriously beautiful because in all of them he let me live a small speck of his fear. He held back the curtain into the death that he saw so closely and detailed. As my hands brushed the fabric delicately, I thought about the ten-inch scar that stretches from his rib cage to his groin and the hole in his bicep where they stuck the tube to get chemo into his body. I thought about all the things that hurt him to make him better, and I felt lucky.</p><p name="f839" id="f839" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I felt lucky in that moment, to have seen and to have felt him –<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to have felt a feeling that wasn’t mine to feel.</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>I felt humbled to have been there when he thought he was running out of time and to have been there, when he had come to realize he was going to have much more than he planned. I was comforted as I let go of his torso, my arms unwrapping from his back and my head lifting from his chest.
