practice is too difficult — it’s just too hard, that we aren’t very good at it and can’t possibly get very far, so shall it seem to be for us. If we believe God to be millions of light-years distant and our spiritual experience will remain cold and uneventful, so shall it seem to be for us. If we’re stuck with the impression that the way forward will never be clear and spiritual guidance is nowhere to be found, so shall it seem to be for us. If however, we come to know that we can have quality meditations beginning right now, and there is no reason why we can’t make much progress on the spiritual path during this life, so shall this come to be our experience.

When you think that He is not here, then you wander further and further away, and seek Him in vain with tears. Where He is far off, there He is unattainable: where He is near, He is very bliss. Kabir says: ‘Lest His servant should suffer pain He pervades him through and through.’ Know yourself then, O Kabir; for He is in you from head to foot. Sing with gladness, and keep your seat unmoved within your heart.” — Songs of Kabir, Rabindranath Tagore</p><p name="3b14" id="3b14" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The person who adheres to the meditation on the Supreme Being, the Ultimate Reality, as outlined in this book by Satguru Kabir, will have the effects of his past life karmas, his present life karmas, and future life karmas, uprooted. (A devotee, through deep meditation, identifies with the Supreme Being that is beyond all karmas and their effects. Karmas operate at the level of the mind/body complex, not at the level of Spirit.)” — Brahmn Nirupan of Kabir, Saying 333</p><p name="66f9" id="66f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Brahm Nirupan is another volume of the Kabir Sagar (The Ocean of Kabir) from the same Sant Mat lineage that authored the Anurag Sagar — the Sant Dharam Das branch of Kabir Panth, the Path of Kabir representing Sant Mat, the Path of the Masters, in earlier times — earlier generations of Sants practising Surat Shabd Yoga Meditation before the time of Sant Tulsi Sahib of Hathras, Sant Radhasoami Sahib of Agra, and Sant Dariya Sahib of Bihar.

The person that meditates is, figuratively, churning the ocean of the WORD and obtains fourteen beneficial jewels. Listen to them! (Note: In Indian mythology the gods and demons churned the ocean of milk and got fourteen precious “jewels.” The churning rod was mount Mandara, and the rope was Vasuki, the king of serpents. Satguru Kabir’s churning is different. It is churning of the Word inwardly. It is mystical and metaphorical and deals with accomplishments within the self.) …</p><p name="1462" id="1462" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the wise, discriminative devotee churns the Ocean of the WORD, fourteen “jewels” are obtained. (Note: The fourteen jewels of the Indian mythology are placed in brackets for comparison.)</p><p name="a397" id="a397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first is Love for Satnam, the name of God. (Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth, obtained from the churning of the Ocean of Milk in the mythology.) This love engenders sweet speech, friendliness, contemplation on the Divine, and discards mental agitation, lust, anger, etc… and endows perfect peace.</p><p name="f386" id="f386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second is Compassion. (Kaustubha, precious jewel worn by Lord Vishnu.) Do not use hurtful words, remove bondage and sins and increase love for others, protect the life of animals, etc… Compassion is a priceless jewel.</p><p name="df98" id="df98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The third is Good Character. (Parijatak, the divine flowering tree identified with the wish-fulfilling tree.) The person of good character always performs good actions, whether those actions are continuous or temporary.</p><p name="9a79" id="9a79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fourth is the Sense of Service. (Dhanwantari, physician of the gods.) The person with this jewel serves those in need that are less fortunate, such as with food, clothing, comforting words, etc… It is a generosity of spirit.</p><p name="ac1c" id="ac1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fifth is Bliss of the Self. (Madira, wine.) The person awakened to Self-knowledge is, figuratively, drunk with bliss. This Self-knowledge is the knowledge of the divine soul that produces unalloyed bliss.</p><p name="e13d" id="e13d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sixth is Forgiveness. (Kamadhenu, the wish fulfilling divine cow.) The forgiving person sincerely forgives others that have insulted him or lied to him, or have done wrongs to him. By the power of forgiveness his actions are purified, and his life becomes stress free.</p><p name="564f" id="564f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The seventh is Contentment. (Airavat, the elephant of the god Indra.) The person with this jewel is satisfied with what is available to him. He is at peace and is blissful, and is not troubled by the problems caused by others.</p><p name="db6e" id="db6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The eighth is Awareness of Reality within. (Rambha, a celestial dancing nymph.) The world manifests in countless material forms, but they are all illusory, as they have no permanence. The Reality within is Spirit and it is eternal. The one having this awareness gets salvation.</p><p name="a8bd" id="a8bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ninth is Seven-fold Knowledge. (Uchchaihshravas, the divine seven-headed flying white horse.) This seven-fold knowledge helps to unite the soul with God:</p><p name="aea8" id="aea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Good wishes for the welfare of all.<br>2. Right thinking or inquiry into the nature of the Self.<br>3. Self-reliance in body and mind for seeking Truth.<br>4. Subtle or inner Realization that the Self or soul is Absolute.<br>5. Detachment from Maya through Love and Devotion to God.<br>6. Surrendering to God, and not needing the four goals of life.<br>7. Knowledge of the Super-conscious State.</p><p name="5b94" id="5b94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tenth is True Faith. (Amrit, the nectar, drinking which one becomes immortal.) True Faith is like nectar. The person having firm faith in the words of the guru goes across this world of birth and death. He knows that the teachings that are unproven are false, and has firm belief in truth.</p><p name="4270" id="4270" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The eleventh is Devotion to the Self. (Sharanga, the bow of Lord Vishnu.) Practice the devotion and love taught by Satguru Kabir. With Self-realization, destroy the enemy that is the trap of Death.</p><p name="4b78" id="4b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The twelfth is Spiritually Knowledgeable Speech. (Shankh, the conch of Lord Vishnu.) The person with this jewel performs noble actions, meditates, reflects sound intellect, and sees the presence of God everywhere. He remembers God always, and keeps his mind united with Him.</p><p name="fe97" id="fe97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The thirteenth is Auspicious Peace. (Shashi, the moon.) The person with this jewel always experiences bliss with no trace of suffering. He is saintly, destroys all defects of the mind, and knows that God is his support.</p><p name="870f" id="870f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fourteenth is Knowing the World as Poison. (Vish, the poison swallowed by Lord Shiva) The world is full of suffering, sins, delusions, hypocrisy, falsehood, etc. Peace is illusory and the mind is restless. The devotee must thus realize the world to be poison, and detach from it. It is being in the world but not of the world.</p><p name="6f50" id="6f50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The devotee that churns the Ocean of the WORD and obtains these fourteen jewels will find peace, bliss and unity with God.</p><p name="5541" id="5541" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These fourteen jewels are the giver of salvation to the one that always meditates and obtains them. They reveal to him the pure light of God, and enable him to have unalloyed bliss. Those that are not so rewarded cannot enjoy such bliss.</p><p name="ff1e" id="ff1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The person that is absorbed in meditation on the Supreme Being remains free of the dualities of joy and sorrow, praise and criticism, attraction and repulsion, etc. He enjoys permanent happiness by becoming liberated in his present life. Such a great soul is free of the three-fold suffering, and lives for the sake of freeing others from the bondage they are in.</p><p name="6864" id="6864" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Meditation of the Absolute Name as previously mentioned is the source of the fourteen jewels, and is the essence of the scripture. Contemplate this and become absorbed in the practice. By its power you will obtain eternal bliss. Sing the glories of the Essence of all Names. Satguru Kabir has made it clear that you will obtain salvation.” (Kabir)</p><p name="7d38" id="7d38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">O Dharam Dass! Seeing your devotion and piousness, I know that you are a very good disciple, so I have happily revealed to you the secret knowledge. Now, keep it in your heart and enjoy eternal bliss.</p><p name="c72e" id="c72e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— THE BRAHM NIRUPAN OF KABIR<br>A Description of the Nature of Absolute Reality<br>(The Necessity of Liberation)<br>Translation by Jagessar Das M.D.</p><figure name="d8a3" id="d8a3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 507px; max-height: 809px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 159.60000000000002%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*5n4k4yL9_HtcUfmX.jpg" data-width="507" data-height="809" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5n4k4yL9_HtcUfmX.jpg"></div></figure><p name="ded1" id="ded1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Being Conscious of the Absolute God Within All Things — Everywhere I look, You Are</strong></p><p name="17ea" id="17ea" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The one who always knows the Absolute in his waking, sleeping, sitting, standing, walking or wandering, is a rare saint in the world.” (Brahm Nirupan of Kabir)</p><p name="bf76" id="bf76" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You are pervading and permeating all places and inter-spaces, O Creator.

In all places and inter-spaces you are the Giver, the Great Giver. Everywhere I look, You are. Lord, You have no end or limitation. You are pervading and permeating all places and inter-spaces; reflecting upon the Word of the Guru’s Shabad, You are found.” (Adi Granth, Sikh Scriptures, Gurbani)</p><p name="402c" id="402c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Below is from the Brahm Nirupan</strong></p><p name="58d8" id="58d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">158. Think of a tree that has branches, leaves and fruit, etc… If someone wishes to have fruit, or leaves or branches, then he would take what he wants. Similarly, one who wants to realize the Name would seek it, instead of the countless other things available in the world.</p><p name="944e" id="944e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">159. In the same way, the Absolute has many “parts” such as nature, Maya and actions, the gods and the incarnations etc., as the Absolute is in all. According to the name of any part of the Absolute that the disciple hears from the guru, that is what he will firmly believe, and that confers knowledge of the Absolute.</p><p name="21dd" id="21dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">160. It is possible to realize the parts of the Absolute as mentioned above, but to realize the causal and astral forms, and the seed that is the Absolute, that has within It the whole of creation, one needs the grace and compassion of the Satguru. It is not possible otherwise.</p><p name="909b" id="909b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">161. By the grace of the Satguru, when a spiritually wise person’s mind is steadfast on the Absolute, it will be absorbed in the Absolute. At that time he will see the Absolute in everything, both inside and outside the gross and subtle manifestations. (In one of his couplets Kabir stated, “When I was, God wasn’t. Now God is, I am not.”)</p><p name="0b2e" id="0b2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">162. With such a vision he would see that the things that are far off or near, and the visible and invisible, the enemy that causes suffering, and the friend that brings happiness, and the things that he has or does not have, that all of these are really the Absolute. Such a person has equanimity of vision.</p><p name="4815" id="4815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">163. The person who has control over his mind and senses, and is governed by noble qualities is called a master. The one who performs service with a pure heart is called a servant. And the reason for the origin of all things is the cause, and the things that were created are the effect. All of these are the Absolute. The beginning, middle and end of creation are all the Absolute.</p><p name="f770" id="f770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">164. The realms of heaven, earth and hell are all the Absolute. Even the earth, water, air, fire and ether or space, are all the Absolute.</p><p name="d3ef" id="d3ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">165. The living beings that have movement (man, animals) and those without movement (trees) in the whole world are the Absolute. The various gods and demons are also the Absolute. Even the demigods are the Absolute.</p><p name="1a48" id="1a48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">166. The one who has realized the Absolute sees Indra and the other multitude of gods, the celestial musicians, and the sun, moon and stars, as the Absolute. Therefore who has realized the Absolute, sees the Absolute everywhere.</p><p name="292a" id="292a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">167. The upholder of the world, and the things that are thinkable and unthinkable are the Absolute. The gross, astral and causal manifestations that are the world, are also the Absolute.</p><p name="f71c" id="f71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">168.

Only such gifted souls are fit for deriving the full benefit from the teachings of Saints and Seers.

The Supreme Father sends Saints and Seers for those who yearn for awakening this power. The moment such an individual comes in to contact with messengers of God, his spirit power is ignited. With little effort from his side and with the help of the Master, he is able to cast aside the coverings over his soul. As the coverings go off, he feels lightness and develops power of penetration into the past and the future. When all the coverings are thrown off, he becomes one with Supreme Father.

The prerogative of God-realization and attainment of the vision of the Divine only belongs to the atman (inner Self) or consciousness within the body. However, it is not possible to accomplish this while engrossed in the distractions of the mind and the body. It is only possible by being free of these distractions while living in the body. To be liberated from the sensory distractions is no easy task. However, it can be achieved with the grace of the Satguru (true teacher). For this, a practitioner must be determined, morally upright, and follow the instruction of the guru. Without these, it is impossible to obtain the grace of the guru. The practitioner can only diligently perform sadhana (literally, exertion to attain an objective, meditation, spiritual practice), but only the grace of the guru yields success in the endeavor. To attain the due rewards of sadhana [meditation practice] it is important to follow the gurus’ instruction vigilantly and steadfastly. Resolve means: not wavering from the path in any situation…</p><p name="d4da" id="d4da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To create resolve in seekers, the Sants give specific guidance:</p><p name="d687" id="d687" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, keep a diligent meditation schedule as instructed by the guru.</p><p name="c19c" id="c19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, leave all desires except the yearning for seeing the Supreme Being.</p><p name="71d2" id="71d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Third, keep in mind the reverence of the guru.</p><p name="ab41" id="ab41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, observe instructions of the guru as the highest duty and consider the guru as the dearest of all.</p><p name="e5e2" id="e5e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Students who can follow the above instructions are qualified to follow the path.</p><p name="2dcf" id="2dcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For success in meditation it is important for a sadhak to be cautious in the following ways:</p><p name="ee50" id="ee50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Following the example of a crow: be repetitive (always at it, never giving up), always remaining vigilant and attentive in sadhana, and in following the guru’s instructions.</p><p name="3316" id="3316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Have concentration similar to that of a crane: always be attentive at listening to the teaching of the guru;</p><p name="f147" id="f147" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Nap or sleep similar to that of dog: be willing to follow the instructions of the teacher without laziness;</p><p name="4ea8" id="4ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Eat less: cultivate a sense of detachment from all physical pleasures and bodily desires;</p><p name="9b9f" id="9b9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Finally, detachment: indifference to the ‘ups and downs’ of home and family relations.</p><p name="ffde" id="ffde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is important that a student should cultivate these qualities.

Rather, the seeker endures the delay, and keeping faith in the guru’s words, enthusiastically waits for the moment of Divine realization.</p><p name="395b" id="395b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Infinite knowledge is like an ocean with unlimited water. The ocean makes its water available to anyone who wishes to draw from it. However, the person who wants to draw water from the ocean is only limited by the capacity of his vessel for carrying the water. It is not the fault of the ocean if humans are limited in their capacity to draw water. Those who have bigger vessels have the capacity to carry the most water. In the same way, humans vary in their capacities to draw from the Divine Ocean of knowledge.</p><p name="f866" id="f866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In the words of Sant Maharshi Mehi:</strong> “All the Sants are said to be impartial and are equally compassionate toward all beings and their grace showers like the rain, equally on everyone. Nevertheless, just as the flowing rainwater gathers only in the deep hollow places, the grace of Saints gathers in the hearts of those disciples whose hearts are emptied from worldly distractions and whose devotion is deep. They are ready to receive the grace of the guru. Furthermore, a devotee through service becomes eligible for the guru’s grace and, not surprisingly, attracts the teacher’s grace. Those who are careless and do not tend to the vessel of their hearts are able to hold only a little that the guru offers. Others, who are diligent in caring for the vessel, gain benefit by attracting the grace of the guru. In the teachings of Sants, this is the secret of serving the guru and following his teachings. Those who learn knowledge from the guru become humble and grateful and the devotion to the guru arises in their hearts naturally and effortlessly.”</p><p name="e8f3" id="e8f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The seeker is like a vessel.

Withdrawing from all other physical names and sounds and only focusing on the name given by the guru is called: ‘material but Formless meditation.’ Withdrawing from all material forms and focusing on the image of the deity as taught by the guru is called material-visualization meditation. The meditation on the point or bindu is the subtle form of meditation. The meditation on the countless Divine Sounds is considered the subtlest form of meditation since it does not require visualization or focus on any form. This is called the most subtle and Formless meditation.</p><p name="f09d" id="f09d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“When we close our eyes and do not see any objects, this does not mean that there exists nothing that can be seen. In other words, the shapeless darkness is also an object. Unfortunately, we cannot even see pure darkness because we are constantly thinking about the images of the world, and instead of seeing darkness we see the imaginary sights projected on the screen of inner mind. Without practising the meditation of focusing in the darkness, it is not possible to see the subtle Light that lies deep within. The experience of Divine Light in the meditation brings joy, and the progress then becomes rapid. Consequently, one’s faith and conviction becomes stronger.

The practitioner becomes free from taking birth in this world. The practitioner whose consciousness grasps the Central Sound even once escapes the afflictions of time and death. This practice of meditation is the direct path as was stated by the Prophet Mohammed. By treading this path the practitioner reaches the untainted destination of Khuda (a word for God in Urdu) or the realm of the Supreme. This path of meditation is described by Jesus as the eye of the needle, and by going through it one attains the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the path leading to Nirvana as described in Jainism and Buddhism. This is the Unstruck Sound (Anahat Shabd) revealed by Guru Nanak, which is heard by closing the ears, eyes, and mouth. This meditation is the essence of all the different religions, all sacred texts and the core message of all Sants and sages. This meditation takes the practitioner to the ultimate goal.
