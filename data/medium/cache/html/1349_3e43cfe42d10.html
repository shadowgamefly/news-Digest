I would typically start out with a lengthy introduction of the speaker’s various accomplishments and things that make them notable and noteworthy.

And <a href="https://paulromer.net/about-paul-romer/" data-href="https://paulromer.net/about-paul-romer/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paul Romer</a>, who’s now, of course, the chief economist at the World Bank, he opened his <a href="https://paulromer.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WP-Trouble.pdf" data-href="https://paulromer.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WP-Trouble.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most recent paper</a> with the assertion that for the last 30 years, macroeconomics has been going backwards. And I looked into this and I realized that Tyler got his PhD exactly 30 years ago. I don’t necessarily want to imply anything causal, but do you agree with Paul?</p><p name="7644" id="7644" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> [laughs] I don’t agree with Paul. I think we understand credit crunches much better than we used to. We understand the structure of asset returns and when and why risk matters, compared to earlier times. Models where you have multiple equilibria, where more than one thing can happen, we understand better.</p><p name="ca3f" id="ca3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think we’ve solved any ability to predict business cycles or market crashes or Great Recessions. In that sense, there’s not progress, but I think the best theories often imply they’re intrinsically difficult to predict. So I think we ask much better questions, and on that particular issue of science, I’m much more optimistic than is Paul Romer.</p><p name="1c9e" id="1c9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> What do you think of the paper itself and the claims in it?</p><p name="0d36" id="0d36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> I thought the paper was quite a polemic. Writing a polemic can be useful. It attracts attention. It jolts people out of their “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-causality/#KanAnsHum" data-href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-causality/#KanAnsHum" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dogmatic slumbers</a>,” to use the old philosophical term. But that said, a lot of the debate ended up being about either Paul Romer or a particular group of macroeconomists, rather than about what macroeconomics should do.</p><p name="9c00" id="9c00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I think a central question for macroeconomics is economic growth. I think our understanding of the determinants of growth, just like our understanding of how well science does, is extremely poor. Much of that is ultimately cultural, and bridging economic and cultural ideas we’re very bad at. And I think macro has neglected that centrally important topic. That would be my main critique of macro. But it would be phrased more gently than Paul’s.</p><p name="5806" id="5806" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> I would take it that’s partially because of your differences in temperament and not just the differences in belief structure.</p><p name="e032" id="e032" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Yes. But Paul — when I talk with him, he has a very gentle temperament. So I don’t actually have a good theory of Paul. I get on with him very well; I enjoy exchanging ideas with him. But sometimes he’s a firebrand when he writes.</p><p name="606e" id="606e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> I want to dig in on this question, where you just mentioned how we have much better models now, but you touched on this notion of our predictive ability. And it seems to me that the old joke about economists, where economics is the field where you can win the Nobel Prize for proving or for showing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em>, and then later, you can go on to win it for showing that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em> is in fact false. And the Nobel Prize in ’74, when <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/myrdal-bio.html" data-href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/myrdal-bio.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Myrdal</a> and <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-facts.html" data-href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-facts.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hayek</a> shared it, was evidence for this.</p><p name="5fa8" id="5fa8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the thing I wanted to ask you is how much progress you think is actually possible here.

I’ll ask you the question, To what degree do you have confidence that economics will ever get to durable answers to these questions, and what do you imagine the version of the Paul Romer paper in 30 years to look like?</p><p name="03e8" id="03e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Knight.html" data-href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Knight.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Frank Knight</a> once said something wise, maybe overstated, but <a href="https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.73933/2015.73933.The-Ethics-Of-Competition-And-Other-Essays_djvu.txt" data-href="https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.73933/2015.73933.The-Ethics-Of-Competition-And-Other-Essays_djvu.txt" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">he said</a>, “The main function of economics was to offset the stupid theorizing of other people.” So it’s very useful as a form of discipline. And economics is a way of thinking — it’s very useful for inoculating you against other kinds of mistakes, even though in some ways, it may be a mistake itself. But I would say, in macro, we’re very good at retrodiction. If you look at the Great Recession, and you try to trace when and where were the bad mortgages made, and which banks held them, and when did they go bad, we can trace that with a level of detail and care, that, say, we couldn’t have done for the 1979-1982 recession. And that’s a scientific advance.</p><p name="1fd0" id="1fd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But in terms of control, we believed in the great moderation; we were wrong. Now we’re probably wrong again. You have people like <a href="http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/59" data-href="http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/59" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jeremy Stein</a>, who are convinced the Fed shouldn’t be holding rates down, people like <a href="http://www.krugmanonline.com/" data-href="http://www.krugmanonline.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a>, who are more or less convinced they should have been. And given that we cannot rerun alternate histories, I don’t think statistics simply getting better will ever settle a lot of these key questions. So economics will always be hovering between art and science.</p><p name="19d6" id="19d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> Will it always be retrodictive, or does it become predictive at some point?</p><p name="f0af" id="f0af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> I don’t think it will be predictive any time soon, not in our lifetimes. Not on a lot of important issues. There’s plenty of micro where it’s predictive. So people who work at Uber, they have a dataset and they can now answer questions with that. That works pretty well.</p><p name="de0a" id="de0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> OK, on what basis should we then be making macroeconomic decisions?</p><p name="109c" id="109c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Well, we <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">have</em> to make macroeconomic decisions. To do nothing is also a macroeconomic decision.</p><p name="b95d" id="b95d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> Right. [laughs]</p><p name="b88a" id="b88a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> I think the notion of having a Federal Reserve System that is predictable and tries to keep the nominal flow of purchasing power growing at some steady rate, we know that something like that is close to the best we can do in a fairly impressionistic way. And that’s really important. People didn’t know that in 1929. It’s a huge victory for the contemporary world.</p><p name="66ad" id="66ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> So do you think that, from a forward-looking standpoint, we should try to come up with some very minimal set of stable rules along the lines of what you just mentioned? And after that, the, again, forward-looking predictive efforts we’ve done most of as much as we are likely to be able to do, and everything after that is filling in the details on what happened, ex post.</p><p name="46e1" id="46e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> I agree with that, but I would add another caveat. If you have a good rule, you have to wonder if all systems — including the US Constitution — all systems in the world eventually can be gamed. It could be your macro rule would be good for a long time, but it could be gamed if only through people figuring out how to use politics to distort or lie about the indicators. So I’m not sure there’s an eternal solution, but I think there are policy semi-solutions that at least are good for 20 or 30 years.</p><p name="c369" id="c369" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> You’re touching on this notion that maybe economics is a lot of post-hoc illustrative power.</p><p name="781d" id="781d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Yes.</p><h4 name="905a" id="905a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">On culture and economics</strong></h4><p name="5dfd" id="5dfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> Uncertain how much predictive power it has. You’ve written a lot about how the study of economics has influenced your appreciation for the arts, and for literature, and for food, and all of the rest. You haven’t written as much about the influence in the reverse direction. How has your appreciation for and study of the arts influenced your study of economics? And is this a version of that?</p><p name="096b" id="096b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> This is a version of that. Here would be a simple example: If you think about Renaissance Florence, at its peak, its population, arguably, was between 60,000 and 80,000 people. And there were surrounding areas; you could debate the number. But they had some really quite remarkable achievements that have stood the test of time and lasted, and today have very high market value. Now, in very naive theories of economics, that shouldn’t be possible. People in Renaissance Florence, they didn’t produce a refrigerator that we’re still using or a tech company that we still consult.</p><p name="723f" id="723f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there’s something different about, say, the visual arts, where that was possible, and it was done with small numbers. So there’s something about the inputs to some kinds of production we don’t understand. I would suggest if we’re trying to figure out, like what makes Silicon Valley work, actually, by studying how they did what they did in the Florentine Renaissance is highly important. You learn what are the missing inputs that make for other kinds of miracles.</p><p name="4f33" id="4f33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ireland and writing would be another example.</p><p name="5502" id="5502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> [laughs] What fraction of tenured economists in the US do you think would agree with your take on the predictive power of macroeconomics?</p><p name="0134" id="0134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> There’s really a sharp distinction here between people who do macro and people who don’t. So those who don’t are typically pretty cynical, but I think they’re actually too cynical. Macro is the favored whipping boy of a lot of economists. And the public is always upset at the macroeconomy, so you’ll always find an audience for this. But I think macro is slightly underrated. But then in macro, you have too many people who are simply too arrogant. They think they’re working on God’s chosen method in different ways. And that’s wrong also; it’s much more pluralistic than that. You’re just grabbing parts of the elephant in a fairly blind way, I think.</p><p name="9a12" id="9a12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> What field outside of economics has the most to say about macroeconomics?</p><p name="9c10" id="9c10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Well, if you’re discounting statistics or econometrics, I think psychology.

But big-picture questions of political economy — they can be very hard to control.

And that while globalization might cause a decrease in across-country cultural diversity, we shouldn’t look at it at some God’s eye view, objective level. We should instead be focused on the individual, the subjective, and the operative level of diversity.</p><p name="cce5" id="cce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here in San Francisco, we see the fruits of all that globalization, right? But you also say in the book, you do acknowledge the point, that there might be a decrease in total global cultural diversity as a consequence of globalization. If you think culture is so important and so underinvested in and so understudied, is it not too hasty to advocate for a force that’s producing a net reduction in the quantity of it in the world?</p><p name="d0f2" id="d0f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Well, there are multiple readings of a number of my books. And I would say, when you’re looking at the globalization of culture, we’ve engaged in a rather significant cashing-in exercise. Say you have a very small community, Inuit in Canada or <a href="http://www.balix.com/travel/guide/chapters/balinese_art/balinese_art.html" data-href="http://www.balix.com/travel/guide/chapters/balinese_art/balinese_art.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">artists in Bali</a>, they’re very small in number. And until they’re in some way reached by larger, richer cultures they can trade with, in many instances, they’re not that creative. They have some tradition, but it’s not fully mobilized. Then there’s this intense cultural interchange, and it’s very fruitful. There’s a flowering, there’s more commercial sale. Top creators come to be, more genres are defined. There’s more diversity within the Balinese world or within <a href="http://www.northernimages.ca/Inuit-Art-General-Information/History-of-Inuit-Art.aspx" data-href="http://www.northernimages.ca/Inuit-Art-General-Information/History-of-Inuit-Art.aspx" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Inuit sculpture</a>, say.</p><p name="4fde" id="4fde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But eventually, that peters out as the smaller communities are absorbed by larger ones. Over the last century, we’ve done an unprecedented amount of this cashing in, by having smaller cultures obliterated. Now, one way to look at it is, well, they’re there and if you never touch them, that’s a shame. Is there an optimal rate of cashing in? I’m not sure that’s a variable you can control. But I think along some critical dimensions, our next century will be less creative than the last because we’ve cashed in on such a large number of small groups.

It’s very interesting: you go back, read people right after World War II . . .</p><p name="7e70" id="7e70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> Why is that, given all the putative cyber warfare and pathogenic weapons and all these other catastrophic macro events that we think could occur?</p><p name="a7ac" id="a7ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> There’s a chance pathogenic weapons could become more important at some future point, but for now, it’s still nuclear weapons.

Whenever the party elected is objectionable, the people in opposition become stupider, as pretty much a rule. They become more emotional, and they attack the worst versions of the ideas they’re against, when I think they should pick and choose more, and should move more toward the center, and try to bring more Americans along.</p><p name="344f" id="344f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The important thing now is to give people who are Trump supporters an open path into not being Trump supporters, and being something else.

You’ve often argued, contrary to the prevailing trend in the US and in Europe, that society should become more religious.</p><p name="40ae" id="40ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Sure.</p><p name="8bcb" id="8bcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> It would be a good thing if that happened. Why do you believe that? And what’s the crux of your disagreement with the supposed expert opinion that holds the opposite position?</p><p name="c601" id="c601" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Well, first, let me say, I am myself a nonbeliever. You could say I’m an agnostic, but tending toward nonbelief. But it seems to me, religion is a very special form of cultural capital. It’s people’s most fundamental beliefs about the world. People <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">will</em> believe in something. And for much of the West, I see Christianity, and to some extent, Judaism, as having had a very special role. The notion that we should just cash in on that and all become secular, and not be sure what we believe in — I see a great danger in that.</p><p name="85c3" id="85c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you visit a place like England, where church attendance is remarkably low, people are extremely secular, that strikes me as unhealthy. Secular societies tend to fall into much lower birth rates. They don’t reproduce themselves. That’s one of the most damning things you can imagine, actually, about a society.</p><p name="b95a" id="b95a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Religion, even adjusting for income, has predictive power over the birth rate. It’s one reason why America still has a stable or a typically growing population, along with immigration. And American religion has stayed remarkably strong for our level of income. It seems almost obvious to me that’s a positive.</p><p name="d7e9" id="d7e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11377" data-href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11377" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paper by Jon Gruber</a> using instrumental variables — religion tends to make lives better: more social capital, more cooperation. But that’s, I think, secondary to the bigger-picture question: What do people believe in? Do those beliefs encourage self-replication of the basic society or not? And America’s doing a good job on that, mostly because of religion.</p><p name="4b46" id="4b46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> Is religion one of the few remaining sources of durable cultural diversity in an increasingly connected world?</p><p name="4c47" id="4c47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> It is. And there’s something fundamentally strange about religion, but in a rewarding way. My next interview — it’s actually on Thursday — I’m <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/rabbi-david-wolpe-leaders-religion-israel-identity-7c159c2ed2d" data-href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/rabbi-david-wolpe-leaders-religion-israel-identity-7c159c2ed2d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">interviewing a rabbi</a>. So I’ve been re-studying the Bible. And the Bible’s one of the most beautiful, strange, and open-to-multiple-interpretation books that there is. And it’s one of the books you can learn the most reading and rereading and rereading. I’ve been finding this very rewarding.</p><p name="6545" id="6545" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You look at parts of the culture. Like today, Shakespeare and Jane Austen, they’re much more popular. But our knowledge of the past gets thinner. Those secondary figures seem to be getting lost. A small number of things get elevated: maybe it’s the Beatles from the 1960s music, Shakespeare. But, say, a lot of the Russian novelists seem to be falling away. People don’t seem to read <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/" data-href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nietzsche</a> as much as they did in the ’60s or ’70s.

I agree with [Georg] Hegel’s remarks on polytheism that may not be conducive to political order. I’d say that’s still an uncertain question, but it’s a worry I have. And as [David] Hume <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hume-the-natural-history-of-religion" data-href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hume-the-natural-history-of-religion" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, monotheism itself breaks down into partial polytheism because people want multiple things to worship, to pray to, to talk to.

Whether that’s good or bad, it’s a fact. And if you try to make it too rational in a particular way, a very culturally specific way, you’ll simply end up with less giving. And then also, a lot of the particular targets of effective altruism, I’m not sure, are bad ideas. So somewhere like Harvard, it has a huge endowment, it’s super non- or even anti-egalitarian. But it’s nonetheless a self-replicating cluster of creativity. And if you’re a rich person, Harvard was your alma mater, and you give them a million dollars, is that a bad idea? I don’t know, but effective altruists tend to be quite sure it’s a bad idea.</p><p name="9b89" id="9b89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think there’s too much pretense of knowledge in the movement as it is.

A function, say, that used to be served by music when you’re in the seventh grade — “This is the band I like” — it’s now served by social media.

And write down on a given day, “What molecules impacted my body?” People, they’re upset about Trump. Obviously, there are risks, things that are bad, but it’s also a healthy exercise. Write down each day, “The Trump molecules, did they impact my body today?” And in some ways, they will. But it’s a very different perspective. So if you stop reading about tech and AI and whatever, and just write down a bit on this. Keep a molecules diary.

My question was, a lot of us look at issues or read about issues and then think, “Oh, what would Tyler Cowen think about this?” and go to your blog and try to pass off your views as our own.</p><p name="cd73" id="cd73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">[laughter]</p><p name="d944" id="d944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> That’s not scalable.

I don’t think any one person is very good on Twitter, no matter how smart or clever they may be. And I don’t think any one blogger is very good at all. So there’s a kind of embedded algorithm in blogs, Twitter, other social media.</p><p name="514b" id="514b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re really good at reading the system, that’s when you learn things. That’s extremely powerful. And every day, I try to train, retrain myself in reading the system. And I feel that’s a skill I’ve become pretty good at. But I’m always working on it every single day. That’s the one thing, I’m always, “How can I improve this?” obsessively. I guess that would be my advice, to downgrade the individuals and try to understand properties of these systems better.</p><p name="b038" id="b038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AUDIENCE MEMBER:</strong> Hi. I grew up in the Rust Belt, and I’ve watched a lot of large companies, tech companies, come in and try to build hubs — technology hubs — in those areas. And invariably, they move in and then five years later, they close down. If they can’t be tech clusters, what can they be? Or maybe they can be tech clusters and they’re just doing it wrong. What should they do?</p><p name="c15c" id="c15c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> I think the final number of tech clusters will be quite small: the Bay Area and several parts of China, Israel being a much smaller but still potent one. I think it will shock people how few tech clusters develop. Because it’s a fragile ecosystem. It’s about project evaluation, its closeness to the number of major financial centers, and there are relatively few of those.</p><p name="052e" id="052e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now you’re asking, “What will those areas become?” Well, empty, I hope. But I understand the transitional problems, and I think one thing you’ll see from the Trump administration is a big redistribution of income back to those regions. And it will actually solve some problems.</p><p name="0ace" id="0ace" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the longer run, I’m not sure how that will work out. When you want to neglect a region and have it empty, and when you want to try to keep it going, that’s a tough call. But I think we’re going to see big changes, like with Medicaid. There’ll be block grants, perhaps, given out on a formula that rewards Rust Belt states.</p><p name="3fdc" id="3fdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AUDIENCE MEMBER:</strong> I wanted to connect two points that came up tonight. First, you are the original, or the pinnacle, of an infovore. I estimate that you process about a kilo of books a year, and at the same time, you also have a great social circle. So, how would you say friendship adds something besides the information feed of talking to people like Robin Hanson? What’s the friendship better than, say, reading literature about Robin Hanson?</p><p name="66ab" id="66ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> It’s very important to keep yourself engaged and motivated. And for me, a good rule of friends is to really try to be myself and be willing to be weird, if it’s even weird, and let people self-select around that, to some extent. And that’s worked well for me, more than trying to make friends.</p><p name="0d8a" id="0d8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friends tell you when you’re completely off the mark. It’s companionship, common sense of purpose. It’s really, really important to be working with people at least you have friendly ties with. Even if they don’t feel like you’re friends with a capital F, in the sense that a Russian would use that word.</p><p name="f35f" id="f35f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AUDIENCE MEMBER:</strong> Hey. I was talking with a friend of mine about possible next start-ups that we could start, and we’re thinking about starting a religion.

First, in chess, so much of the creativity already stems from AI, computers playing chess. I’ve listened to computer-composed music, art.

And you write about this despite the fact that, I think, you believe that cognitive biases are themselves overrated. Can you, just for the folks here, quickly describe your current take on mood affiliation and what it is? And then, what is something that people here don’t believe and really don’t want to hear because of our own sort of collective Bay Area/Silicon Valley mood affiliation?</p><p name="6d69" id="6d69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COWEN:</strong> Mood affiliation was a concept I first coined to refer to people who judge arguments by the mood of the argument. There are some writers — maybe they’ll remain nameless — but they’re optimistic. If an argument is optimistic, they think the argument is more likely to be correct: “Well, things have been getting better.” I’m not saying that carries no weight, but be a very strict Bayesian, not just because the mood feels comfortable.</p><p name="d39c" id="d39c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of very contemporary partisan debate is really about moods. If you feel someone is not condemning something with the right mood, you’ll reject the attached substantive claim. So a lot of the exercise I do on the blog is trying to teach myself how to detach and how to unbundle things, and inter-temporally substitute moods and contain bundles of optimistic, pessimistic, condemning, approving, tolerant, intolerant — whatever moods — at multiple levels at the same time, in some way.</p><p name="a09f" id="a09f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Bay Area strikes me as having a lot of pearl clutching and a reputation for thinking it’s more tolerant than it is, and I think that’s true of both coasts. I think, in general, all cultures are oblivious. And America, in particular its coasts, tend to think, “We’re the cosmopolitan side of American culture.” And I really don’t believe that. I think you’re a uniquely brilliant, twisted, inward-looking, diverse monoculture, and I’m very glad you are.</p><p name="8056" id="8056" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">COLLISON:</strong> [laughs] Wait, wait, wait.

Religion is underrated. I think, in general, people in California overrate the efficacy of government. I think libertarians underrate it. But if we’re in California, I guess I can’t <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> make that point. And you have unique advantages here. You have the cluster. So there’s a lot of things you can do and get away with that don’t work in a more general way, like raising the minimum wage to some level. That cluster gives you enormous rents.</p><p name="c298" id="c298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world is not built out of clusters like that, so I would just say, be careful about overgeneralizing from your experience <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">here</em>. But so many things, we’re like, “I’m sure my view is right; California’s wrong.” I don’t think that’s the right way to go about it.</p><p name="bf56" id="bf56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would say, “Oh, I like Southern California better than I like it here.” Maybe that’s unacceptable. I think Los Angeles is the greatest city in the world. I’d love to live there; it has the best ethnic food. There’s something about it, the way it’s a cosmopolitan city, sense of openness. Someone once said, “What’s real there is so phony and what’s phony is so real.” It’s always surprising me, and I love <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">their</em> diverse monoculture.
