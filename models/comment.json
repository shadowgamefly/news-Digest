Moreover, admissions officers wrestle with questions and uncertainties.Part of the problem is that colleges are evaluating far more applications than before, thanks to the Common App and other factors. This makes it harder for individual students to stand out; hence the pressure (perceived, real, or both) to excel on all fronts, to go \"above and beyond.\"Also, we live in an era of buzzwords and Big Ideas. Yes, there's much vague talk of the importance of leadership--but also of teamwork, social justice, creativity, etc. These terms mesn little in the abstract: as commenters have pointed out, \"leadership\" can mean many different things. Admissions officers want it to mean something; they probably won't be impressed with a president of twenty clubs. Part of the challenge, then, for students, admissions officers, op-ed writers, and others, is to use language precisely and richly and to look beyond jargons and types.
