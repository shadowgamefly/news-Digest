[  m  m  ] Like the K-Pg impactor event, and \"Unlike the [initiating] Kellwasser event, the Hangenberg event affected marine and terrestrial habitats.\"That would make it the 2nd impactor that could be tied to mass extinctions, unless I am mistaken. Unlike the K-Pg event it may not have impacted unlucky regarding location (in calciferous and sulfurous sediments) but unlucky in time (after some other environmental stressor had bottlenecked diversity).Now the terminology gets confusing. A gamma ray burst (GRB) seems to be referring to the burst when a bipolar supernova (SN) collimated gamma ray jet hits us face on.What would be the chances that the first identified MW bipolar SN was line-of sight? And wouldn't that decrease observability? I tried scanning the paper, it seems they don't identify the GRB direction, but that the SNR is aligning 'West to East' from our POV. Am I mistaken?Assuming I am not mistaken, maybe our suitably accessorized ancestors would have picked up on, by necessity of the efficient jet collimation, a scattered gamma ray diffuse glow that may accompany bipolar SNs (I assume).

The compression of the substrate will pack onto one of the tips of the serrated edge where the stress concentration can do its work.I suspect the reason the quills work better is that they're entering normally to the flesh (nominally) so it's the squishy-substrate problem.

If only the first person who buys the first seeds has to pay, and can thereafter replant and sell the crop at will, it will be impossible to support a vibrant genetic research program. Multi-generational patents are therefore essential. It's not a simple matter of calling people 'scum'- life is a little more nuanced my friend.",

Knowing or suspecting that most of them were likely GMO progeny (Roundup Ready), he sprayed them with Roundup and harvested them. Some of the harvested seed was used to plant subsequent crops.Scotus is going to struggle to split this baby. As Justice Scalia observed, ruling that the first generation progeny in the grain elevator is protected by patent will create a fair use problem that essentially gives the patent holder (Monsanto, in this case, but that's irrelevant) a legal claim over the use of what has historically been a commodity just because some of their patented technology might be present in some amount. The potential future ramifications are immense. Suppose a patent holder decides that since their GMO is loose in the general population (be it soybeans, salmon, flowers, sheep, or whatever), they are entitled to patent royalties on every sale of instances of that species because their patented genetic material is or might be present in some amount? The mind boggles.I think there is hope that Scotus will rule the first generation progeny as unprotected. Monsanto can reasonably foresee that the progeny of their seeds will be distributed as part of the general population of that commodity and be used as a commodity and that part of the reasonable use of that commodity is that they might be planted.The second generation progeny that Mr. Bowman used are another question entirely.I would guess that the second generation progeny harvested from the first generation progeny will be ruled as protected due to one unique aspect of this particular case. Mr. Bowman's application of Roundup to his planted crop of \"undifferentiated\" seeds ensured that the only plants that survived would be the ones carrying the protected Roundup Ready (RR) gene. In effect, the selection process triggered by the application of Roundup caused a new instance of protected GMO to be produced.I'm hoping that the first generation progeny is covered by exhaustion, because any other ruling will create a level of patent protection that will affect us in ways we can only guess at right now.",

To me that is far more convincing than previous approaches which mainly try to fit past data.One thing I've come to realize is that science is an application of Bayesian inference (which is itself an extension of logic, see  E.T. Jaynes on probability theory). Namely, from two claims \"if the theory is true, then we should observe the following\", and \"the following has indeed been observed\", we draw an inference: \"the theory is more plausible\".The question is how much does an observation matter. How much do we adjust our evaluation of plausibility (posterior vs. prior probability of the theory)?Qualitatively, in order to get a stronger inference, you want a surprising prediction and a closely matching observation. Those characteristics were the beauty of some famously historical experiments. For me, climate science is having difficulties finding such critical predictions. In particular, average temperature predictions with a wide error range don't seem very surprising. The trouble is that I don't know how to quantify the surprise (how likely would the observation be if the theory was wrong?), so I rely on a gut feeling, which is clearly susceptible to bias and which cannot be rigorous.Anyways, that is just my perspective. I'm suggesting that to be more convincing, climate researchers need more observations matching specific predictions and they need to explain why those predictions are surprising.",

Thus, the existence of dark matter may not be needed to explain the large scale universe structure -- it could be the increased discrepency between Einsteinian physics and a better model that takes into account the difference between inertial and gravitational mass (if the hypothesis pans out), just like Einstein was able to predict the orbit of Mercury and light curving around a planet.Another area that could shed light into a better physical model is in black holes. Currently Einstein's equations break down at the center of a black hole, so clearly some quantum mechanical effect needs to take place (maybe, if length is quantised, it cannot be 0 and therefore Einstein's equations don't break down because you can never get to the point where it evaluates mass/0).

Clearly it's bad to spend money on duplicative efforts, but from your article, you haven't found $200 million of duplicative grants:\"Through this manual analysis, they found 167 pairs of grant summaries—a little over three hundred total grants—with “suspicious” overlaps in research aims, hypotheses, or goals. These grants correspond to around $200 million in total funding, with an estimated $69 million in overlapping funds (the initial grants being, on average, 1.9 times larger than the potential duplicate).\"Of that $200 million, the researchers only found $69 million in overlapping funds.  That sounds like $131 million of that $200 million figure was probably original.  Moreover, of the $69 million, you take pains to point out that probably only a fraction of these overlapping grants were actually duplicative, since they may well be for different aspects of the same broad research project, or for continued funding of a long term project.  Duplication may be a problem, but it's clear that it's a smaller problem than the conclusion of your summary suggests.",

A smooth surface fabricated out of a perfect conductor should reflect 100% of the incoming signal power and transmit 0% of it.  This is why you would get no cell signal inside of a well constructed metallic box (the incoming signal cannot penetrate it) but you CAN get a decent signal inside of buildings with wooden or concrete walls (transmitted component is weak but detectable).So, what happens when the reflecting surface is not smooth, as in the case of a rough sea?

Sure, few people would back that, but its important to know the actual opposite pole from Watson's views.  Me and a lot of the molecular/genetics/genomics people I know argue more matters of degree about the balance between environment vs genes rather than a one being significantly more dominant than the other.I could agree with this analogy, but only in a specific context.  Our DNA does define us as a machine - say a very complex processor.  But that program you mention, that's the inputs, the environment we live in.

THUS, we cannot say \"wormholes exist and they will send you to x time and space,\" but it is perfectly acceptable to say \"we believe wormholes exist and believe their effects to be such and such.\" See the difference?",

You don't know the field at all (For example, can you define \"scientific theory\" for me? I'm not being snarky. I'm genuinely asking.), and you're trying to criticize it.You're watching a baseball game. A batter hits the ball, and it's a grounder. The pitcher catches it, throws it to first base before the runner gets there, and the umpire calls an out. The sports announcer doesn't say, \"And the runner's out because if a first baseman stands on a plate while holding the ball before the runner gets there, it's an out.\" He doesn't need to say it, because the viewer already knows. He simply says, \"And he's out.\" There are a few people there who might not have seen or played the game before, and they're asking the people next to them about the rules, and why the batter's out. What you're doing, on the other hand, is playing the part of a newcomer who doesn't know the rules and saying that umpire doesn't know what he's doing. It's willfully ignorant and flat-out insulting.Nope. Once again, you haven't taken the time to learn anything about the field but are trying to criticize it. I have to italicize once more: All scientific statements are tentative.I could excuse this kind of behavior twenty years ago, when you might have needed to find specialized books to find this information, so the non-scientific layman could easily misunderstand these things. But if you're on Ars, you have the Internet available, including Wikipedia. Do a little reading on the scientific method. Then ask questions about it. Quit yelling at the umpire that he doesn't know what he's doing.Science has plenty of real problems. There's no need to fabricate new ones.No, I was the one who mentioned religion and philosophy.Belief: 1) a state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing (Merriam-Webster).  Believing something to be true is pretty much the opposite of how science works.And as others have pointed out, they don't add \"we think\" to every sentence, because they would just be extra words that don't add any information.",

The goal of the proponents of a theory, which in hypothesis testing term amounts to an observation within theoretical (also observable) constraints, is to make it fully tested on all its predictions.For context:I find this overly simplistic and unable to predict why for example inflationary standard cosmology will likely stand for ever as the first and therefore likely last tested consistent cosmology.

Well, the placentals will have a common ancestor for their specific group, and the marsupials will have a common ancestor of their specific group. However, if we go back in time a little further, we will find a common ancestor of both groups (and if we throw in the monotremes, a common ancestor of all mammals), which would correspond with milk producing. If we cut off one clause at a time, we reach an even older common ancestor for the more general group: tetrapods, lobe-finned fish, jawed fish, all fish, chordates, all deuterostomes, and finally all bilateria (the common ancestor which would finally unite us with the insects and other arthropods, as well as molluscs and other groups). So, while you may find such similarities as a one-way digestive system or having eyes more convincing, those similarities describe common ancestors for a broader group than the one focused on in this study: the placental mammals.",

But, as baloroth points out, quantum computers will probably be used only for very specific problems (like the simulation of quantum system), at least at first. And don't knock quantum simulations: they will offer the possibility of actually calculating material properties, rather than the current trial-and-error method. This will be truly revolutionary, hence the excitement.Second, quantum computers are not some version of analog computers. The basic mechanism is completely different (quantum vs. classical mechanics). The reason analog computers don't exist is that they cannot be made fault tolerant, and quantum computers can. In fact, there is an analog version of a quantum computer using so-called continuous variables, which also does not have a fault tolerance theorem. So in my opinion it is entirely unhelpful to bring in analog computing to the discussion, because it is and always has been a non-starter due to bad noise properties, both in the classical and the quantum world.",

Even though some of you bring up a good point in that having to read texts, and especially texts using shorthand, acronyms, and/or abbreviations, means that it should be considered writing does not make it writing.If you look at some of the earliest 'writing' such as hieroglyphs, pictographs, and other early forms, there is very little about it that actually equates to writing  as we know it today.  For me writing, as McWhoter says in that talk, is formal, meaning that it is a way we have developed to present ideas in an unobtrusive, non-inflammatory way.  Writing in my opinion has evolved as a means of presenting ideas without offense.Speech on the other hand is quick, and I'm not talking about the rhetoric we see on newscasts or talk shows or political speeches.  I'm talking about the everyday, talking to your coworker, or family, or friends type of speech.  That is what texting mimics, and I see the day in the near future where texting becomes a more widespread, normal mode of human interaction.One ting that I want to point out however is that most of my texts are grammatically correct, and rarely do I not capitalize a word, but if I miss one it's not that essential to go back and edit it so that the text is perfect.  To further expound on that I tend to use periods to denote a change in topic or an end of subject as opposed to a pause for breath or some such other break as used in writing.Oh, and I'm not a big fan of many of the acronyms in use either, for example I'd much rather type call me, than hmu./omgwtfbbqThis is where I have to disagree with the OP and further replies.This is not about recognising and defining a new LANGUAGE - but recognising and understanding a different dialect, (not a new form, or even version), of the English language.Most of text speak exists to shorten the representations used in the 'normal' written form of the English language, (and omitting most of its punctuation). It's not a new version of the English language, because the BASIC content and rules still apply that this dialect is used to represent.  If the spoken form of the English language was abbreviated and affected the same way, then this would be different - but it's not, (and cannot be, without it becoming a completely different language and losing its current relevance and consistency).Merely adding words (such as lol), to an existing language does not turn it into a different one, especially if such words obey the basic rules (which they do - (lol is an exclamation)).I therefore agree with Ranvel's post above.This is, of course, a discussion of where the lines are drawn between different dialects and versions of a language - (I can't really see another form (such as writing or speaking) appearing any time soon) - and text-speak does not meet the requirements, (IMO), of being a different version of the English language, let alone being a completely different language altogether!",

Since the ABC feels the need to interview skeptics in response to any mainstream climate coverage, a handful of skeptics ended up with a lot of airtime to air their views.When the media insists on presenting a 50:50 balance of of opinion on an issue where the public opinion is closer to 90:10, then it is no wonder that public perceptions are skewed.",

The carbon in the CO2 represents all of the carbon that was in the honey (or whatever substance you're testing).  So, you can measure the various isotopes of carbon in the CO2 (12-C, 13-C, 14-C) and see what the ratio is.  The sugar (and proteins, if present) in the honey will have different ratios of 12-C/13-C based on the plant source of the honey (the nectar harvested by the bees).  The ratio can tell you if the honey derived from a C3 plant or C4 plant.  Unfortunately, flowers (good) and rice (bad) are both C3 plants, so isotope ratios can't differentiate between them, usually.  Maybe this newer method can, but that detail isn't here.  Corn is C4, so honey adulterated with HFCS or something is easy to spot.  The Chinese know this and have mostly abandoned using HFCS and use rice syrup almost exclusively now.  As to why there are different ratios, it comes from enzymatic kinetic isotope effects.  At every step of the sugar synthesis in the plant, enzymes are involved.  For each reaction, catalysed by an enzyme, the exact chemical mechanism will favor either the lighter (12-C) or heavier (13-C) isotope of carbon.  In the end, each one of the carbons in the sugar will be at a pretty constant ratio (12/13) based on the different enzymes in the process.  Now, even though different plants will use the same enzyme to catalyse a particular reaction, they will differ just enough that the ratio of 12-C to 13-C will be just a little different.  In the end, the additive effect will be to give you different 12-C/13-C ratios in the final sugars.  This is measurable.  The isotope effect is much more pronounced with hydrogen (1-H/2-H), but it's much harder to measure, so it's usually not done.  It's a technical nightmare to measure these tiny differences in the intact molecule, so we burn the sugar into CO2 and measure it there.  Hope this wasn't totally opaque, I'm making dinner right now.Fun fact, the US consumed more \"honey\" than was produced in the world last year.",

In private, even some of the proponents have serious doubts.What's absurd about the global warming hysteria is that adapting to a wide range of temperatures is something the human race does supremely well. We're the only species that lives in regions where winter temperatures plunge below -50 degrees F, and the only one to live where summer temperatures can rise above 110 degrees. That's a 160 degree range and one that even pre-modern tribes were able to handle with aplomb. And yet we are being told that a 2-4 degree temperature rise over the space of a century will be a disaster for the modern, technologically adept human race. That's utter nonsense. And keep in mind that, every day, humans adapt without the slightest difficult to a 20 degree swing between day and night temperatures.I'm more afraid of being plummeted to death by a two-year old with a bag of marshmallows than I am of global warming.

I would go even further than bsharp by saying that the statement isn't just fine for a popular audience, it's a fine summary for anyone. The statement *does not* imply a higher order intelligence, just the presence of a higher order regulation system. Both of the feedback mechanisms you describe would fall under that description, and, considering the results of this study, we can at least guess that this feedback mechanism is being actively selected for; it's not just an emergent phenomenon under no selective pressure. I'd personally be fine with going further and saying that the brain was therefore *designed* to deal with starvation in this manner, but that's because I'm ok with the idea of design without a designer. Just like you appear to be ok with a mechanism being tuned without a tuner Anyway, saying that the brain is doing these things is merely synecdoche, with no implication of the involvement of homunculi.

The reason not to use a classical computer with a quantum network is that it is the sending of a quantum entangled state that is important. With the possible exception of quantum encryption, there is no point in using a quantum network with a classical computer—it buys you no capability. But for a quantum computer, being able to transmit a quantum state is a very big deal and allows you to do things you otherwise could not. Similarly, for quantum packets you cannot build a network from a series of classical point to point communications. Reading the routing header would destroy the quantum state you are interested in, and there is no way to build a repeater to boost the signal. Effectively what has been done here is to design a way to read a routing header and packet, even with data loss, and make a new boosted packet with the same entangled state and going in the right direction, all without performing the dreaded 'measurement' that would destroy the encoded quantum state.Another way to think about it is you need to build a network where you never actually detect an single photon, as that destroys the information you were trying to send. Tricky, and it sounds like this is a clever answer. Chris, a question for you. In this process have they given up quantum cryptography?  Lets say you build the packet to withstand a 75% photon loss. Can you put in a beamsplitter and read your 'copy' of the packet without affecting the state of the transmitted packet? If yes, then even for a packet that can sustain lower losses, could you potentially pick off small percentage of the beam before and after each router reboosts the signal, kind of a quantum non-destruct attack?",

However, the vaccine also covers types 6 and 11 which are more commonly associated with genital warts, not cervical cancer.Also note that there are two HPV vaccins available from different manufacturers: Gardasil and Cervarix. Gardasil covers types 6, 11, 16 and 18 which includes the strains which cause cervical cancer and genital warts. However, Cervarix covers only 16 and 18 (the cervical cancer causing strains). While the vaccines are quoted as only protecting against the above mentioned strains, there does appear to be some carry over coverage of HPV strains other than 6, 11, 16 and 18.Also, there is still some benefit in vaccinating women who were already sexually active when the vaccine came out. There is a chance that they may not already be infected with the strains covered by the vaccine.

An aurora 100 times brighter might stand out as the brightest people have seen in their lifetime, but it would hardly stand out as hugely different from any other aurora they might have seen at the same location.  I have seen the same type of display you have in the Midwest maybe half a dozen times.  Given the years apart between them and the limitations of human memory, I really could not say how the brightness of those events compare with each other.Furthermore, the presence of the moon could have a significant impact.  A full moon might make a bright aurora seem rather mild.One final point.  The location of the aurora is not strictly related to the strength of the aurora.  There have been solar storms that produced fantastic aurora displays, but the auroral ring remained around or above the arctic circle, so were not seen at lower latitudes like in the U.S.  Such displays would go completely unnoticed during the summer when those high latitudes have 24 hours of daylight/twilight.This is not to say that a giant solar storm, producing 20 times the protons as the largest storm on record, absolutely could escape detection.

It is later that the volatiles tend to freeze out according to different \"ice lines\".But the idea that there was a question on how Earth got its water comes from two sources what I am aware of.One source is that it was observed that enstatite asteroids nearly matched Earth composition but was unusually dry. I think the consensus now is that the rare enstatites have nothing to do with Earth formation.Another source is that crust metal content shows that it has been resupplied by impactors, and that we have a dense impact record on the Moon et cetera. So it was believed that volatiles came from there.Since D/H hydrogen isotope ratios shows that comets and asteroids have difficulty to be the only water source, mixed models for water that includes some indigenous accretion water gives the best result. (I'm sure I can find the ref, if asked.)Mostly, the problem seems to be to predict why Earth got so _little_ water. \"We often talk about the Earth as a water-rich planet; in fact, when astronomers refer to Earth-like planets, we generally mean worlds capable of hosting liquid water. However, in comparison to the gas giants, Earth is actually very water poor! The Earth is only 0.023% water by mass, while the outer solar system giants are as much as 40% water. [And asteroids come in between, so have too much water too.]The explanation usually invoked to explain this situation is the concept of the “ice line”.\"\"There’s just one problem: protoplanetary disk models (the mathematical theory and computer simulations behind planet formation) indicate that, as accretion slows and the disk cools, the ice line should migrate inwards – and end up well within the Earth’s orbit! According to the theory as it stands, the Earth should be water-rich and thus much bigger than actually is!\"[Addressing the assumption of magnetic-rotational instability as responsible for disk turbulence, a recent paper finds:] \"This is very exciting – after t~1 million years, there is a growing ice-free region right around the Earth’s orbit! This resolves the discrepancy of previous models, and provides ample time for an ice-free Earth to evolve. Further work will be necessary to validate this model. If it proves consistent, then we may have reconciled planet formation theory with the water-poor Earth: Regions of low turbulence in the protoplanetary disk allow formation of water-poor terrestrial planets.\"[  m  m  ]Best of all, it should be a generic model, predicting that the water poor worlds with oceans and continents that we know and love are frequent.

Mass is only part of the determinant of those temperatures/pressures.  If an object accreted quickly, for instance, it would be hotter than one of the same mass that accreted slowly, simply because there had been less time for energy to radiate away during the accretion process.  Similarly, if the original dust cloud had been more dense, then gravitational collapse would convert less energy to heat than if the individual collapsing particles had started the process further apart.  Obviously, for objects much smaller or much larger than the 13x dividing line mass becomes the overwhelming determining factor.Interestingly, though, a brown dwarf would not be much larger in diameter than Jupiter.  It would just be more dense and much hotter.",

For example, see the 's section on pseudorandom number generators. Another application is in El Gamal encryption, which involves computations in a group.

Another is the simple collision-resistant hash function f(x, y) = g^xh^y for fixed generators g and h of the quadratic residues mod safe prime p.As an aside, there is an indirect application of Mersenne primes to crypto. As I mentioned earlier in this thread, the family of locally decodable codes (LDCs) called matching vector codes rely on Mersenne primes. LDCs provide private information retrieval (PIR) algorithms, which is a topic in crypto. You can read Yekhanin's thesis/mini-book on LDCs and PIR if you want.",

      "content": "Interesting article and some good points you raise. It should be pointed out that while the California Public Health Goal is 0.02 ug/L, the Maximum Contaminant Limit is 50 ug/L (although this is currently being revised; very curious what they end up on, as naturally-occurring Cr6+ is quite widespread in the area where I live; anything below about 30 ug/L is going to have massive cost impacts to a lot of communities). A few more issues. The article mentions that the narrator or presenter of the show filters his water because hex chrome was detected at 0.19 ug/L. If he is using a normal carbon filter, it really doesn't work very well for hex chrome. The chrome will bind to the activated carbon loosely for a while, but it is dislodged very easily by other common contaminants. Running water with elevated hex chrome through a filter can actually result in pulses of water in the effluent enriched with hex chrome compared to the influent concentration. A reverse-osmosis filter should be effective, though. Another issue to point out is that anthropogenic hex chrome is often not the result of dumping chromium (or hex chrome), but rather changes to the geochemistry of the aquifer (through releases of other chemicals) that results in oxidation of naturally occurring trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium. Of course, this tends to happen in areas with elevated chromium to begin with, so it is often very difficult to determine whether elevated hex chrome is naturally occurring or the result of anthropogenic activity. In some areas the biggest source of anthropogenic hex chrome contamination is actually the result of earlier cleanups of other contaminants, especially chlorinated VOCs (one of the preferred methods for cleaning up PCE, for example, is to inject a chemical oxidant to break down the PCE; in the wrong soil type, you end up with a nice Cr6+ plume, which can be much harder to address than the original solvent plume). I hadn't even heard about this PBS show on the subject, but it is a really interesting issue. Especially for Californians, as our location on the edge of a tectonic plate means we have lots of altered ultramafics (such as serpentine) that are enriched in heavy metals such as chromium. I assume Oregon and Washington have similar issues, but they are likely less dependent on groundwater than places like the Central Valley.",

If you can correlate with mass (by measuring the wobble), you can now also get density.Now I read that the second measurement can be used to measure the size of the planets orbital radius.  How can we tell the difference between orbital radius and planet size?  I.e. how do we tell the difference between a small planet close to the star, and a large planet further away?And, damn, I just answered it.

I like the authors' work, and they achieve nice expression but this is very much a tool for studying early life mouse brains. Plasmid electroporation in developing mouse brains has been pioneered by several Japanese researchers ( m  m ). The mode of delivery means that the area of expression is small - a few mm sq. Delivery is limited by the diffusion of the plasmid which is aided by what is, essentially, in vivo electrophoresis. Not really so good if we want to genetically engineer a voluminous adult human brain. Even with viral vectors for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, delivery over large areas is still tough, requiring multiple burr holes, and delivery at several brain depths (Ron Crystal's lab) or taking advantage of the innate massive interconnectedness of the brain (Krystof Bankiewicz's lab) to inject in one region to achieve delivery to another, remote area.",

That means a large variety of orbits are available no matter where the satellite is launched.\"Um, this is true of rockets, too.  Once they leave the launch pad, they can be steered anywhere you want them to go.The primary limitation of orbital choices is not whether you can steer your launch vehicle (because that's easy), but rather what latitude you launch from.  Minimum orbital inclination is essentially equal to launch site latitude.  (Plane changes to reach a lower-inclination orbit are possible, of course, but they are very expensive in terms of propellant compared to launching from a lower latitude.)Now, it _is_ true that the White Knight 2 could take off with its payload and fly to lower latitudes or presumably even all the way to the equator before launching said payload.  That indeed is a benefit over vehicles tied to a specific launch site away from the equator, but that is not what the author described.",

He always wanted to know how much more money he needed to get to the next motorcycle. So he basically figured out addition and subtraction on his own at around 4 years old. Now obviously, this isn't the best way to be teaching someone, but it does work.  And for that matter, my other brother learned how to read because he wanted to know what the heck we were doing playing Pokemon. With a little bit of guidance, and a lot of time spent hitting buttons and figuring out what each thing meant, he at least picked up on what words were and what they meant, even though it took him a little longer to figure out sentences.  Also, to respond to some of the ADD comments before, all three of us have what most teachers and doctors believe is ADD. But, I have never viewed it that way. My attention isn't grabbed because the information isn't provided in an interesting enough way. I can only do repetitive tasks for so long before I have to switch over to something else. I also tend to understand things the first time though, so if you show me something once, I get it. Showing me a second, third, fourth time will not help at all and I wont pay attention until something new comes along.  These facts need to be taken into account with children of this generation. Not everyone is the same, and as such, people need to be taught things in different ways.  The reasoning for being distracted is far more important than the fact that they are distracted in the first place.

Or was that when the evening news would tell me which household object scientists said would kill my child today?For every comment thread that derails a reasonable article, there seem to be 10 that offer intelligent counterarguments or factual corrections to the author, and that is so much healthy than pronouncements from authority on topics a journalist often has no formal training in. Personally, I find it really fascinating to watch debate in the comments evolve on stories that come up repeatedly over time: Something like tax rate: first one group will make a claim about how few people pay taxes, and that'll dominate the comments sections of relevant articles. Then a few people will point out that's just federal taxes and list all the other taxes. Then that becomes a common argument that gets used everywhere. There's this cadre of individuals who read and comment across many sites, and talking points and arguments that work on one story get repeated and repeated until the countervailing view comes up with a good counterargument, and the debate shifts again.

If we admit that we know very little in the grand scheme of things, what is to prevent someone else from claiming that they have the true facts, the ultimate truth?  The scientific method, that's what.  The creationism vs. evolution issue is a clear example of this.  While science admits that it doesn't have all of the answers and admits that there's still much to be discovered, the scientific method - that constant demand for proof, that ever-present skepticism - is what is valuable.

They are \"emitted\" from the substrate no matter what; if they are allowed to escape, the paper contends that the efficiency of the cell is increased, whereas if they are not allowed to escape (ie, favoring heat generation within the cell) the efficiency of the cell falls.Saying a solar cell must emit light gives the impression that they must have lightbulbs (or some other active light source) in them to work most efficiently, which is the opposite of the paper's assertion.  A solar cell must allow low-energy photons to escape rather than produce heat or disrupt higher-energy photons reacting with the substrate.

Do they emanate somehow from the accretion disk before the matter crosses the event horizon, or do they erupt internally from within the black hole itself?If they come from within the black hole itself, isn't it then a misnomer that nothing can escape the gravitational force of a black hole?  IIRC the quasar's jets originate from the magnetic poles, so I'm guessing the magnetic field of the black hole is weaker at the poles, as it is on Earth, which allows the matter/energy to escape.  Perhaps the event horizon itself is not a uniform spheroid around the black hole as I would imagine a gravitational field to be, but instead shaped to match that of the magnetic field?Wouldn't that mean that it's not the gravity then that's hard to escape from a black hole, but it's magnetism?Makes me wonder at the likelihood then that gravity is not actually how a body warps space/time around it, but that gravity is really more of the sum quantum magnetic attraction between bodies.Another possibility being that if gravity can be strong enough to warm space/time then why not magnetism and the gravitational field around a black hole is normal (non-space/time warping), but it's the magnetic field that does all the warping preventing light's escape.Pardon me for think-typing aloud.",

What if it's a bi-directional process, whereby behaviours influence genes and genes influence behaviours? This would explain why genetic mutation occurs throughout populations - an individual tries a certain behaviour, if they perceive the result as successful they do more of it and it follows a path of, e.g. initial attempt -&gt; conscious habit -&gt; unconscious habit -&gt; semi-autonomous response (\"muscle memory\") -&gt; genetic trait. This would help explain the anomaly between the estimated number of random mutations that would have been needed for life as we know it to have developed on Earth and the average time between them given our current estimates of when life began: THE MUTATIONS ARE NOT RANDOM. Certain behaviours are much more likely given existing genetic traits, those behaviours lead to modified genetics which then influence the next generation(s). Edge cases of unlikely behaviours still occur; if the success of these is comparatively  much, much better than the general population then it leads the evolution in a different direction - more successful for the species/genus concerned.",

It does so, by binding the E2F transcription factor as well as an HDAC (histon deacetylase). Itself is regulated by the CDK4/Cyclin D complex which phosphorylates pRb, which then releases E2F and HDAC.It was first discovered in a tumor called Retinoblastoma, which had a mutated form of the tumorsuppressorgen and thusly did not correctly bind E2F and HDAC, which leads to an uncontrolled mitosis, thus letting tumors grow uncontrolled.I actually think that E2F might lead to the transcription and translation of some sort of ligand in those tumor cells, which in turn binds to an (usual unused) receptor on the monocytes, which leads them to switch into granulocytes. It is thus not really \"evading\" the immune system but just uses an happy coincidence. Of course that's just a guess.By the way people with leukemia can also get AIDS. Since HIV infects a certain subset of T-Cells (I believe CD4+ T-Cells). Leukemia can have a effect on different subsets of leukocytes. In fact I believe the \"Berlin patient\" was in fact \"cured\" from AIDS by receiving a bone marrow transplant from a HIV resistant donor after he also suffered from leukemia.One more thing: many viruses actually hide from the immun system.

If a pathogen ever evolves that is so successfully deadly that it kills its hosts instantly, it will probably kill everyone in range of infection and then promptly go extinct, or at least dormant.  Since most pathogens rely in some fashion on their hosts' biochemistry for optimal reproductive success, the most widespread and evolutionarily successful pathogens are the ones that are either non-lethal or at least that spread much faster than they kill.It's unlikely that a universally-lethal highly-infectious pathogen would arise at any given time, because the overall evolutionary pressure on diseases is actually away from being lethal.  Less infectious lethal pathogens kill their vectors and don't reach the full vulnerable population.  It can happen, which is why we've had pandemics in human history.Lastly, just disabling the immune system isn't a free pass.  After all, most plants and simpler organisms don't have anything like the human immune system, but they still find enough ways to resist or avoid disease enough to get by.  Something tells me that many of the factors that apply in those cases also work in our favor, above and beyond the benefits we get from our immune systems and from being smart enough to fight back on time scales of years rather than generations.",

Alternatively, you can go the other way and make your test really good at avoiding false positives (specificity) by setting your threshold for calling disease very high but that comes at a cost of missing disease.A quick glance at Table 2 (after a moment of gratitude for the fact that it's open access) suggests that's pretty much how these apps work. All have either very high sensitivity but poor specificity or vice versa. If I were a developer, depending on how cynical I was feeling and the legal risks involved, I'd consider setting my threshold very high to minimise the number of false positives. The way these apps are likely to be used in the general population, the vast majority of suspicious lesions that people test them on are likely to be benign so on a per-user basis, you'd probably be 'right' the large majority of the time if you just called everything benign.

One problem: the most dangerous type of melanoma (nodular melanoma) frequently displays NONE of the ABCD signs these apps use. Not only will nodular melanoma be missed by people using ABCD rules, but these phone apps can give a false sense of security that can directly lead to the death of the user. Unlike the three other types of melanoma, nodular melanoma has an early vertical growth phase and will not be large in diameter or irregular. Worst yet, melanomas in their vertical growth phase are invading the dermis and gaining metastatic potential. Remember that with melanoma, traditional chemotherapy and radiation are not effective and once the disease spreads beyond its primary site, the 5 year survival rates are some of the worst of any cancer. The only way we know of to effectively treat melanoma is to excise it with wide margins while it is still confined at the original lesion. These apps and the false sense of security they lend may eliminate the motivation for people with nodular melanoma to seek the only therapy known to be efficacious in curing the disease.

The theory is that if you have enough capacity demand then it is cheaper to build giant heavy low cost rockets in mass quantity than to build highly complex expensive high performance rockets (which you will never be able to afford to mass produce). Of course the whole concept basically rests on needing to lift LARGE amounts of material into space so you can crawl down the volume production curve. The Aerospace Co. design was made of maraging steel and built to \"shipyard tolerance\" (IE you could do the dimensional welding in any shop) and it certainly would have worked.

Wallace spent far more time in the field than Darwin, much of it in SE Asian jungles rather than on shipboard. And he supported his research by selling some of the insects he found to collectors in the UK. Darwin, on the other hand, spent much of his life on an English country estate and benefited from the fortune his wife had inherited. They were two very different men. Also, it seems to be true that the possibility that Wallace would publish his work is what motivated Darwin to finally go public with his views.Those who'd like to know more about Wallace and in particular how his views differed from those of Darwin might want to read Michael Flannery's Alfred Russel Wallace: A Rediscovered Life (2011).",

Battery technology is just not there yet. Batteries are heavy and do not have the energy density of fossil fuels. They do not have durability and consume lots of rare earth metals. Charging speeds are also an issue. Even fast charge stations are not nearly as fast a filling up at a gas station, plus they wear out the battery even more quickly. Tack on the expense of replacement batteries and it all looks a whole lot less attractive. Don't plan on any road trips with a electric car.Hydrogen fuel cells provide the best of both worlds, pairing a electric motor with next to no emissions and the convenience of a liquid fuel. Although that is not to say its not without faults. While the energy density is similar to gasoline, liquid hydrogen is much more volatile and must be kept under pressure. Imagine that in airplane and car accidents. The explosions would be much more prevalent than with gasoline. Also while Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, its usually stuck to something else which results in extra effort separating it. Infrastructure is also a problem. In light of the apparent problems, is is wise to build out charging stations or refit gas stations to handle hydrogen?

      "content": "On to the new: - I expect the dipole asymmetry will grab people, despite the Planck team being able to test the isotropic standard cosmology better than ever before on large spatial scales.What is notable is that the high-l (small spatial scale) data test as constant such parameters as spatial flatness to larger scales than the observable universe (give or take cosmic variance). So maybe the dipole is an observation of some nearby anomaly that inflation expansion didn't quite erase. Meaning it could be compatible but hard to nail down.- The now ascertained cold spot, which like the dipole was present in the WMAP data but could be attributed to instrument uncertainties, will likely make many (especially crackpots) claim premature evidence of multiverses in the form of vacuum bubble collisions. Beyond that it will be interesting when the teams that have looked at this on the uncertain WMAP data looks again:\"Cutting to the chase, we were first able to use simulated CMB data containing bubble collisions to rule out a range of parameter space as inconsistent with WMAP data. As it turned out, the existence of a temperature discontinuity at the boundary of the disc greatly increases our ability to make a detection. We did not find any circular temperature discontinuities in the WMAP data.While we didn’t make any clear detections of bubble collisions, we did find four features in the WMAP data that are better explained by the bubble collision hypothesis than by the standard hypothesis of fluctuations in a nearly Gaussian field. We assess which of the two models better explain the data by evaluating the Bayesian evidence for each. The evidence correctly accounts for the fact that a more complex model (the bubble collisions, in this case) will generally fit the data better simply because it has more free parameters. This is the self-consistent statistical equivalent of applying Ockham’s Razor. In addition, using information from multiple frequencies measured by the WMAP satellite and a simulation of the WMAP experiment, we didn’t find any evidence that these features can be attributed to astrophysical foregrounds or experimental systematics.One of the features we identified is the famous Cold Spot, which has been claimed as evidence for a number of theories including textures, voids, primordial inhomogeneities, and various other candidates. A nice aspect of our approach is that it can be used to compare these hypotheses, without making arbitrary choices about which features in the CMB need explaining (focusing on the Cold Spot is an a posteriori choice). We haven’t done this yet, but plan to soon.While identifying the four features consistent with being bubble collisions was an exciting result, these features are on the edge of our sensitivity thresholds, and so should be considered only as a hint that there might be bubble collisions to find in future data. The good news is that we can do much more with data from the Planck satellite, which has better resolution and lower noise than the WMAP experiment. There is also much better polarization information, which provides a complementary signal of bubble collisions (found by Czech et. al. – arXiv:1006.0832). We’ll be gearing up to analyze this data, and hopefully there will be more to the story then.\"[  m  m  ]- The work to constrain inflation physics which started with WMAP is going on strong with Planck. Already the simplest models are excluded at 2 sigma, but slow roll single field is likeliest and so are _concave_ (no or low tensor mode) hill like field potentials.

Imagine a complex series of waves on a guitar string that superimpose to create an almost-standing wave near one end that rides down the string at some consistent velocity based on the string's tuning.  That would be the timelike wavefunction, which maybe gets messed up relativity-style when the whole system is moving near c.  In such a system, interacting with (or literally \"fiddling with\") the end of the string would cause changes in the almost-standing wave at the other end.  Such a manipulation would be felt by any other strings entangled with this one.Opens a can of worms for causality, but seems as good an explanation for delayed choice experiments as any.  Extrapolating, the use of quantum memory to stretch the delay into human-scale time makes the string billions of times longer and therefore much more difficult to manipulate meaningfully.(Note: using a string as an analogy, not specifically hitching my wagon to string theory.)Edit: typo",

We use primary cells all the time that can't be recharged. 1600wh-hr/kg is pretty good energy density and I can see a lot of uses for something that either can't be recharged, but has that energy density, or else can only be recharged a handful of times.Granted it would depend on how long it could keep its charge \"on the shelf\". Also, is the 8 recharges if you discharge it completely? Or is that 8x its capacity can flow out and back in to the battery before it is spent (IE 8 full discharge/charge cycles will kill it the same as 80 10% discharge/charge cycles)First off, an emergency battery for something if they have long shelf life could be invaluable if they are cheap and have other good characterisitics. UPS possibly as second tier power support if they have good characteristics otherwise. You have your, say, 12v 8ah lead acid battery for short change overs to keep from draining the sodium-air battery, but if an outage lasts more than a minute or two it cuts over to the nice beefy 12v 80ah sodium-air battery that is 1/4th the size of the lead acid battery and 10x the run time. Oh and it can recharge a few times before it needs replacing.Where you need high electrical power and a generator is not a possibility and cost of replace/refurbishment isn't necessarily a big issue. What about Torpedo battery packs instead of oxygen-kerosene or other mixtures (yes, it would be BYOO, unless of course a sodium-air battery could breath the oxygen difused in the water)? Maybe smaller UAVs and drones that would normally use lithium ion batteries right now.Anything you'd use a primary battery in just about, with the perk that you could recharge it a few times before recylcing/chucking it.Anyway, I would think 8 recharges in and of itself would not necessarily be something that would stop it from being a potentially useful chemistry for a battery. Heck, it could easily replace something that could manage 80 recharges, but had 1/10th of the capacity.I think that is one of the things that I wonder about with lithium air batteries. I don't know the exact number of recharge cycles they've gotten experiments up to, but I'd think if capacity is even just 10x existing and they only manage something like 50 charge cycles out of them, that would make them on par or better than regular lithium ion batteries. Sure 1/10th or less the number of recharges, but you can go 10x as long before recharging evens out a lot of it. It might not make them useful for something like electric cars...but even then, the battery pack could be considerably smaller to save weight and improve efficiency, and also (I assume) be significantly cheaper. So you get 1/10th of the number of charges for 10x the range. Or make the pack 1/10th the size, have to replace it 10x as often, but at 1/10th the cost and also have the reduced size/mass penalty to the vehicle.I do hope eventually the issues are solved and we can get as cheap (or cheaper) lithium-air and sodium-air batteries with all of the advantages (or more) of current lithium ion batteries with those massively increased capacities.",

You can manage your mp3 collection beautifully with all that meta-data.  But if that data cannot be manipulated in a standardized way along with the file (including the ability to transfer that data along with the file and have a recipient's system be able to make use of that data), then you don't have anything that is useful in a big-picture way.Imagine if EXIF data for images were stored at the FS-level.  Is that really more useful than having it part of the standard document format?  Right now, document-embedded EXIF data means that you don't need all possible OSes that would handle the file to have compatible meta-data layers in order for the data to be transferred to and usable on different systems.  If such data were stored in FS-level structures, every OS that touches the file would have to be meta-data-aware or the data wouldn't just be useless, it would be lost.  Remember, a photo starts on a camera device and may variously end up passing through Android, iOS, Windows, Linux with various FSes, Mac OS X, Google's proprietary FS, etc.And once you decide (like most users will) that you don't want to create your own custom system for tagging your mp3s, you will choose an app that will manage that process.  And then as a user you don't really care what the underlying process is for storing that data, except that you'd like many of the fields to transfer over if you send a file to a buddy.  Which is really an argument for embedding document-type-specific meta-data directly into the document format, rather than relying on OS meta-data support.",

If results are then compared, it is revealed that the state of the photon WAS decided by the quantum random number generator, even though the entangled photon on La Palma was measured BEFORE the other photon even arrived at Tenerife.An event in the future (quantum random number generator on Tenerife randomly deciding the entangled photons' state) determines an event in the past (the entangled photons' state before arrival at Tenerife). Scientists on La Palma can know a random event in the future with precision, but causality is not violated because they can only communicate with the scientists on La Palma at the speed of light (which is infinitely slower than \"instantaneous\"). The photons don't seem to exist in \"time\" at all, which makes sense considering that they are moving at maximum speed through space (general relativity). But normally we aren't aware of this fact.

Adding CO2 increases the height of this point. At this higher point, the temperature is lower, and lower temperature matter emits less radiation. It is this effect that changes the energy balance.See Edit: Apparently the full story is much more complex than this: see Still, I think the simplified explanation here allows deniers to make their saturation argument, which is unfortunate.

That said, by the time this thing lands out carbon technology may get to a point that carbon nanotube and graphene structures are realistic. At that point screw the metals...The instability is minor near the point, and keeping something there requires only small amounts of stationkeeping. However, that same instability makes it easy to depart those points on a trajectory that ends up with them getting slung into another orbit around the Earth or the moon, or out of the Earth-moon system entirely. L1 and L2 are very useful staging points for reaching the moon and the rest of the solar system.A big pile of volatile-rich material and light elements at L1 or L2 to provide raw materials and a steady platform for performing orbital assembly and staging makes a great deal of sense for enabling some real access to the rest of the system.

(Since it seems the acceptor side is ground.) You may need a lot of donors depending on efficiency, and then have to figure out how to replenish them.

If so, then that means the smaller portion that's scrapped in manufacturing is already generating twice as much recycled material as the bigger portion that's passing through consumers before being junked.This makes sense, because a manufacturer is likely to have relatively predictable, ongoing production of scrap aluminum, so they can just have containers where they collect it and periodically send it off to be recycled (and get paid a decent amount for it).

The earth wobbles in space so that its tilt changes between about 22 and 25 degrees on a cycle of about 41,000 years. It is the cool summers which are thought to allow snow and ice to last from year to year in high latitudes, eventually building up into massive ice sheets. There are positive feedbacks in the climate system as well, because an earth covered with more snow reflects more of the sun's energy into space, causing additional cooling. In addition, it appears that the amount of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere falls as ice sheets grow, also adding to the cooling of the climate.\"",

Yes, if we separate T from CP then there is a T violation.  But T symmetry isn't really as interesting as CPT.  Reversing just T or just P is an \"improper rotation\", something that we don't seen anything in nature actually do.  In every talk I've been to on the topic, and I've been to a lot, they always mention how this CP violation or T violation is an important step to understanding the question of why there is much more matter in the universe than antimatter, which tells us why there is anything around at all.. which would be huge.  The problem is, the difference they are pointing aren't differences between matter and antimatter.  They are differences between one combination of matter and antimatter and another similar combination of matter and antimatter.  Which is great.  But is a long, long way from any experiment, any event that actually has a net matter increase.  In fact, no event has ever been observed that has had that net matter production.  For every particle of matter produced, there is always a particle of antimatter to match it.They don't even have events that starts with symmetric matter-antimatter pairs and results in most of the antimatter ending up as antineutrinos and most of the matter ending up as protons and electrons.  This would be pretty interesting since that would give us a way to sequester the antimatter problem without breaking some well verified theories.  But this hasn't been seen either.So I always wonder, why the grandiose claim?",

This seems like it would be a more natural way to treat the condition because it sounds as if the procedure stimulates the body to produce more testosterone on it's own instead of relying on a replacement drug to elevate the levels of the hormone. That and the fact that the hormone surge lasted a whopping 14 weeks means the procedure (if it came to that) would only need to be done every few months.

In the end, the algorithm winds up with a correct image at higher resolution while maintaining the sparsest possible representation.\"Are you sure of this explanation? The phase information is of overwhelmingly greater importance than the amplitude information in the spatial frequency domain.There are a lot of comments so far that are (understandably) pointing to the lack of information present in an image as being the cause for its fundamental resolution limit. However, this turns out not to be the case. There was a beautiful paper published way back in the '60s that showed how objects of finite angular extent can be imaged with resolution far beyond the diffraction limit using the method of analytic reconstruction. There exists one nasty little caveat, however: the spectrum of the object must be known perfectly over an arbitrary segment. If a portion of the spectrum can be known perfectly, the entire spectrum of the object can be recovered perfectly and with infinite resolution. But to know a portion of a spectrum perfectly means to measure it without the presence of noise. It is therefore noise (right down to the photon-counting limit) that limits the resolution, not the capture resolution itself.LKeene w  w",

The problem is exacerbated if the rate of atmospheric CO2 increase is greater than the rate at which the ocean can sequester dissolved CO2 in deep waters and the buffering calcium carbonates. Current rates of atmospheric CO2 increase are about 100 times greater than in the past, which doesn't give the ocean enough time to lock the CO2 away so it piles up and lowers the pH of the seas as a whole. In fact we're dumping CO2 into the atmosphere many times faster than during ecological disasters like the Permian extinction. Not by coincidence, the ocean's pH is also . And no, oceanic pH level are not cyclical, because CO2 levels and rates of increase in the past were not cyclical. Our current rate of acidification is shaping up to be the fastest its been in the past 300 million years at least.

Despite binding essentially the same substrate, the sites are structurally diverse, and often show selectivity for different classes of Q site inhibitors (compare the mode of action of myxothiazol with stigamatellin or atovaquone, say). Sometimes only very small structural differences are required to drive antagonist selectivity, and some compounds, such a quinolones, can bind to both sites with equal efficacy. Resistance-conferring mutation within Qo confers a fitness penalty on Plasmodium (the bc1 complex is less efficient), and so it seems unlikely that double Qo/Qi mutation would be tolerated by the organism. Research into Qo/Qi inhibitors is still very much an ongoing business.Atovaquone resistance paper plug:  m  m Plasmodium bc1 inhibitors:  m  m Nick Fisheredit: typo",
