The group to the left is for close relatives but not true dinosaurs. The old tree grouped the theropods, purple, with the Saurischia, green, and viewed the Saurischia and the Ornithischia as the two major branches of the tree. The scale to the left shows the placement of the tree in geological time. A is the branchpoint that includes all the dinosaurs, B represents the joint ancestor of Ornithischia and the theropods, and C is the joint ancestor of Saurischia and an early group known as herrerasaurs.", "article": 66}}]
