{"content": "The old line \u201cYou spot it. You got it\u201d comes to mind. The writing on the 10th Step in the \u201c12 and 12\" of Alcoholics Anonymous speaks to this quite effectively. It\u2019s universal but it speaks to addicts especially well. We live in our resentments. They justify our need to numb our feelings. Therefore we need to find ways to stop resenting others. The 10th step is \u201ccontinued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it\u201d. Sounds simple but it\u2019s not. It requires us to remember that \u201cpain is the touchstone of spiritual growth\u201d. It advises us to treat others with \u201ccourtesy, kindness, justice and love.\u201d It reminds us to exercise \u201crestraint of pen and tongue\u201d (and keyboard and enter key). It also says it\u2019s a spiritual axiom that \u201cevery time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.\u201d But we\u2019re also reminded of our humanity. We will be imperfect. I do think our modern world makes it easier to be cruel. When we get mad at a driver we only see the car. When we are attacked on line or read things that raise our ire, the 3D human behind it is nowhere to be seen. When a TV pundit tells you a collective is your enemy, the individuals are forgotten. Heck, often the enemy faces the exact same problems as you. Think of the poor whites who voted in favor of deporting poor Mexican immigrants even though these two groups are a natural coalition. I don\u2019t really have anything smart to say that will wrap this up. There\u2019s no point in trying to put a bow on it. ", "child": "", "name": "15_9", "parent": "15", "title": ""}
