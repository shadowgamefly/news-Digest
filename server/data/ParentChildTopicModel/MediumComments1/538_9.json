{"content": "Thanks for responding! It sounds like your company has an awesome culture, and one that they actively foster to make a healthy happy work environment. The \u201cculture\u201d I\u2019m referring to in this article is not actual work-place culture. It\u2019s usually ill-defined, not practiced, and used to exclude people during hiring or to write-off failures within the organization after employee churn, \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a good culture fit\u201d. It is also generally ageist, so I\u2019m glad to see that your start-up includes mature employees who are often left out of the start-up hiring pool. As we both know, their experience is invaluable. Thanks for reading and your awesome feedback! ", "child": "", "name": "538_9", "parent": "538", "title": ""}
