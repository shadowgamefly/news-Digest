{"content": "Good points as always, but I think you should\u2019ve titled this column \u201cDiscrediting Steve Nash\u2019s Career as Many Ways as I Can,\u201d or \u201cHow to Make a Case for MVPs by Only Looking at Points, Rebounds, Assists, and (Sometimes) Team Wins.\u201d You do a disservice to your readers by not even attempting to present an argument or reasoning to explain \u201cwrong\u201d recipients. Things are never so simple as to be self-evident or explained simply by box scores and wins. Not fully explaining context or taking other factors besides slash-lines and team wins, while also describing this column as a lesson in NBA \u201chistory,\u201d is blatantly misleading and disingenuous. While I don\u2019t necessarily think Nash should\u2019ve won in \u201905 or \u201906, (but there\u2019s a damn good argument that he should\u2019ve won in \u201907), I can acknowledge that there\u2019s at least an argument to be had. If someone in high school read this column they\u2019d come away thinking Nash must\u2019ve peddled in sexual favors to secure his two wins. You claim Nash\u2019s candidacy is encapsulated in these two things: 15.5/3.3/11.5 and 62 wins. How about adding something like: he also shot 43% from deep on 3 attempts a game and led the Suns to league-best record and league-best offense. He also orchestrated the 13th best offense of all time (the Suns had an Ortg of fucking 120 with Nash on the floor and 103 with him off). Instead you chalk Nash\u2019s awards up to collective voter \u201cidiocy\u201d like they were huffing paint or something instead of watching games. Same with \u201906: Yes, Nash \u201conly\u201d averaged 18.8/4.2/10.5 and the Suns \u201conly\u201d had the fourth-best record in the league. But how about mentioning that Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, the second-best player on the team, who averaged 26 points per game the season before played only three games? Or that Joe Johnson, a 17 points per game scorer, bolted in the offseason? Nash also shot 44% from three on more than four shots a game. Holy shit! But since it doesn\u2019t fit your narrative it\u2019s not worth mentioning right? It seems that you think your answers to the \u201creal\u201d MVPs are so self-evident that using real reasoning to justify their cases (or even admitting that another player at least has a justifiable reason for being in the conversation) would be a waste of time. \u201cCP3 finished second but should\u2019ve won if you think the Nash MVPs are valid.\u201d Why would anyone think they\u2019re valid? Nash only averaged 15.5 points! Stupid voters! \u201cNash had won two MVPs followed by Dirk, and we were sick of our MVPs choking in the playoffs.\u201d Yeah, Dirk choked in \u201907, but Nash\u2019s Suns made it to round two that year and that was the series where Diaw and Stoudemire were suspended, remember? And Nash went to the WCF in both \u201905 and \u201906 years dude! What! \u201cInstead voters turned to Chris \u201cKarl Malone as a point guard\u201d Paul, whose 21/4/12 was far better than anything Nash ever did.\u201d While I\u2019ll concede that CP3 is better than Nash, saying shit like this is straight-up disrespect and blatant distortion of history. Without getting into playoff heroics (or lack thereof in CP\u2019s case), 3 of the top 20 offenses of ALL TIME (nos. 5, 13, 20) were conducted by Nash. Did Steve Nash steal your girl or something? But really, your reasoning is simplistic and your \u201chistory\u201d is slanted. You\u2019re better than this dude. ", "child": "", "name": "96_5", "parent": "96", "title": ""}
