{"content": "My husband has prostate cancer and he is being treated successfully at Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland, about an hour outside Zurich. They are using similar treatments and have already reduced one of the tumors so much that it is hard to find it, the other is reducing. He goes every three months for a week, although they would like him to stay for 2 weeks. I am going with him for heavy metal detox. The Clinic is amazing, they even have their own restaurant that serves Dr. Rau\u2019s diet. There is also a dental clinic to deal with issues that contribute to the body being able to fight the cancer. We will continue to go until there is no evidence of Cancer.
