{"content": "I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever seen defined benefit plan that required employee contributions. Are they voluntary? Also, I agree that it\u2019s odd that the contributions were taken out of pre-tax money and required that you \u2018settle up\u2019 taxes on the back-end (or did you adjust your w-4 withholding to give yourself \u2018credit\u2019 for the pension contributions?) One note\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can generally make contributions to your IRA until mid-April and still have it apply on the prior year return. If you withhold your contributions until you get your taxes figured out otherwise this can help to give you some flexibility. It\u2019s also prudent since as you\u2019ve found, once you contribute money to a retirement fund it\u2019s pretty much locked there unless you\u2019re willing to part with an early withdrawal penalty.
