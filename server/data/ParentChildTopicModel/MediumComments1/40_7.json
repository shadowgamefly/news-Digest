{"content": "Pretty poor description of what happened on the Russ-Zaza play. The warriors were trying to foul at that point because it was the end of the quarter and they had a foul to give, so they wanted to break up the last play of the quarter. You could even see Kerr and others telling each other to foul the ballhandler leading up to the play. Zaza tried to foul him while he was dribbling, and Russ definitely did not pump fake but did a good job of going up and into Zaza as a shot attempt to get the 3 free throws, but definitely did not get Zaza to bite on a pumpfake.
