{"content": "It\u2019s still amazes me how people still mix up things when referring to the Latin American countries. It should say \u201c\u2026show the true size of Africa and SOUTH America,\u2026 Not Latin America since Latin America is a cultural unity. Mexico and Central America as well as three Latin American countries of the Caribbean are not part of that map change (the three Latin American countries of the Caribbean are Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba) On the other hand the British Guiana and Suriname are both South American countries but are not Latin American countries. So that\u2019s why the article should emphasize that the change is SOUTH American map and not a LATIN American map. Latin American is not only South America and not all of South American is Latin America. ", "child": "", "name": "2462_12", "parent": "2462", "title": ""}
