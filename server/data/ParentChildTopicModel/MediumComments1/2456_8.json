{"content": "Dear Snap commentariat: Design is not a sustainable competitive advantage Your focus on the atom is missing Snapchat\u2019s nucleus You hear entrepreneurs cite \u201cdesign\u201d as their value proposition all the time, but design is not defensible differentiation, because anybody can copy design. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened here with Snap. Design is merely the ante in the app world; you better have a better value proposition than that. I understand your point here, Taylor, that copycats have users who use their apps for different purposes than Snap\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ausers who are trained for different means to different ends. Yes, Instagram and Facebook have users who create content for \u201cone to many\u201d communication. Yet, both WhatsApp and Messenger are \u201cfacilitating deeper communication between a smaller group of friends\u2026 a communication platform, not a broadcast platform\u201d (as you\u2019ve described Snap users\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre). I completely agree that Snap built a better mousetrap for communications too. (e.g. Snapchat was the quickest transmission mechanism for getting a message to a friend/friends.) But, that\u2019s been easily replicated as well. Your attribution is where I think you misfired, Taylor: you misdiagnosed the value in Snap\u2019s product\u200a\u2014\u200athe nucleus that insulates Snap\u2019s competitive moat. What truly differentiated Snap was the privacy niche. It\u2019s where people went when they wanted to communicate \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d \u201coff the record,\u201d etc. Facebook and its app constellation fundamentally cannot compete on that turf, because it\u2019s kryptonite for FB\u2019s revenue model. I wrote more about this here: Snap to Store: The Great AssimilationHow Snapchat compromised its core valuemedium.com That\u2019s an important distinction if you want to deduce Snap\u2019s health or prescribe strategic remedies for its competitive throes. They\u2019re in a precarious state right now, and even though it\u2019s not to late for Snap to figure this out \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 saying \u2018Snap will be fine because design\u2019 would make you right for the wrong reason. Analysis is only worth something if it\u2019s wrought from a repeatable process: in other words, our methods are more important than their outcomes, because methods are the scalable constant we can control; outcomes are subject to variables we can\u2019t control. That\u2019s the importance of being right for the right reasons. Today\u2019s media doesn\u2019t meet consumers\u2019 wants and needs, so here\u2019s a better way to listen, watch, and read:\u00a0Annotote ", "child": "", "name": "2456_8", "parent": "2456", "title": ""}
