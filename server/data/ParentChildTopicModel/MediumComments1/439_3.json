{"content": "\u201cScripture tells us that in the End Times, that is what [the] Antichrist will be\u200a\u2014\u200ahe will be a part of a one-world system.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMichelle Bachmann No, actually, Michelle, scripture doesn\u2019t tell us that. What it tells us is that we will at last beat our \u201cswords into ploughshares and our spears into pruning hooks\u201d and that \u201cnation shall not lift up sword against nation\u201d nor shall we \u201cpractice war anymore.\u201d That\u2019s from the Old Testament book of Isaiah. The Gospels also have Christ weighing in on this, saying that there would one day be \u201cone fold and one Shepherd\u201d and that the kingdom of God was like a tiny seed that would grow into a tree so mighty all the birds of the air might shelter in its branches. (That\u2019s a simile, not a description of material reailty. I encourage you to read the words and deeds of Christ carefully to determine what simile might pertain to.) There is, in fact, no singular apocalyptic character called the Anti-Christ. There is, rather, a spirit of anti-Christ that is ever present in the world and who manifests itself through individual people. As you might suspect, it is embodied in people who show qualities that are the antithesis of Christ\u2019s\u2014hence, anti (against) Christ (the Anointed). So, instead of love, they will show hatred. Instead of kindness, compassion and generosity, they will show mean-spiritedness, apathy, and selfish greed. Instead of unity\u2014something Christ avidly promoted\u2014they will sow division. I leave it to the reader to judge what fits the description of anti-Christ, using the rational approach that Christ himself advocates: to judge them by the fruits of their words, attitudes and deeds (Matthew chapter 7).
