{"content": "I\u2019m excited the North American church is dying. Christians not having the influence we once had in the 1900s gives me great hope. For the past 100 years we\u2019ve had a lot of cultural converts. Everyone is a Christian because they grew up in Texas. Or they go to church. Or their mom and dad raised them that way. Hell, according to the U.S. census 70% of Americans identify as \u201cChristian.\u201d But the vast majority of those responses are nothing more than cultural identification, not Christianity. I imagine that\u2019s why so many people despise Christians. Their belief is cultural, and no one intends to follow the man they claim governs their life, so we end up this giant homogenous blob of hypocrites that judge and condemn people, instead of looking like they did in 165 AD. Instead of rushing to the aid of others, or paying for pagan burials like our ancestors did, we have half-hearted followers who run rampant through the streets of social media pointing the finger to everyone except themselves.", "child": "", "name": "526_3", "parent": "526", "title": ""}
