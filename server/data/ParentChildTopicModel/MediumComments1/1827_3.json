{"content": "Program Design\u00a02.0 The importance of focusing on personal transformation  Kia ora Shruthi Vijayakumar! Great to hear you\u2019re exploring new ideas in the context of Live The Dream. I\u2019d love to hear more about what\u2019s driving that inquiry\u200a\u2014\u200awhat do you feel is missing from Live The Dream at the moment? I hope\u00a0u.Lab is going well this year, and you\u2019ve made some good connections? What has been the greatest highlight of the process so far for you? We\u2019ve been working with Theory U for advancing Program Design in the social space for awhile now, to take a deeper dive into the problems, barriers, and personal motivations for doing this kind of work. I\u2019d say Lifehack are leading the field at the moment in NZ, and EXP (cofounded by Silvia Zuur, Billy Matheson & Anthony Cabraal) are doing some exciting work with Theory U in the events space. I\u2019m excited by the idea that more entrepreneurship programs, be they accelerators or incubators, start paying attention to the importance of inner work. Whilst I understand and have often held the tension of needing to \u2018build, create and get shit done\u2019, I believe that the important piece for the kind of impact we need to see in the world, is often about personal transformation, bridging into group work. I\u2019d say this is Program Design 2.0\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0start\u00a0looking\u00a0at\u00a0evolving\u00a0it further\u00a0too. Obviosuly there\u2019s also plenty of Theory U being used in the Social Labs space around the world too\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s one cornerstone of most practice I\u2019m aware of. So tell us more about what you\u2019re seeking to do with Live The Dream and let\u2019s keep the korero rolling! ", "child": "", "name": "1827_3", "parent": "1827", "title": ""}
