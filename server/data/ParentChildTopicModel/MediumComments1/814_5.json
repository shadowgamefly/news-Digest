Use paper too; it costs less than monitors.)You haven\u2019t actually run a program. You just read and answer questions.(Similarly, the longer it takes to get feedback on whether your thing works, the harder it is to learn. You can either get intuitive feedback and learn like everything ever did ever, or try to be superhuman and learn from deep, introspective, statistical-analytical thought. Ideally, you want a setup that lets you see code changes instantly or shortly after hitting a single refresh key (like F5 in an internet browser).)You\u2019re forcing yourself to work on projects that are so boring you don\u2019t actually care. School classes are great for doing this; sometimes I even take classes to try and pretend to care\u2014it\u2019s a challenge.(boring is slang for useless. In my experience, if I actually need a tool and try to make it myself, it works out well. If I don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s kind of a crapshoot at finding a decent excuse to finish.) *: I\u2019ve seen computer science courses actually do this. I think most courses are \u201ctoo abstract\u201d in similar ways, where there could be more real simulations instead of just reading from a textbook, answering some questions, and magically expecting to be able to do real stuff later. **: If anyone actually can code efficiently on a tiny smartphone, please write about it and link it to me. (I dunno how you\u2019d do this\u2026 multiple tinyphone virtual desktops and a voice or air keyboard? That\u2019s interesting.) ", "child": "", "name": "814_5", "parent": "814", "title": ""}
