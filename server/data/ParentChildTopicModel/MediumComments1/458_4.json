{"content": "Each of those trips costs taxpayers more than $3 million, meaning Trump has already racked up about $20 million in needless travel costs. That is simply a lie. Yes the initial costs to clear all the workers and those who frequent the resort would have been costly, but today there is almost no cost for Trump to go there. Outside of fuel for the jet there is no extra cost for Trump to go there. And it makes a lot of sense. There have been massive leaks from the established Washington as usual circles, Trump simply can\u2019t trust any of the regular people who work there. At his resorts only his security detail and those he invites and trusts can attend and it gives him way more security than he can get anywhere else. The problem with trying to break up the usual corruption inside Washington is there are a lot of people who do not want things to change and are willing to do anything to hurt Trump. By isolating who has access, when a leak happens there are less people who could have leaked it making it easier for Trump to find the traitor and deal with them. Or, the traitors understand the circle is smaller and decide not to take the chance of being busted. either way, it is all good for Trump and the Presidency. Have you noticed less transcripts and recordings and such have been leaked? Clearly this tactic is working. ", "child": "", "name": "458_4", "parent": "458", "title": ""}
