{"content": "There are so many opportunities in clean energy and every miner in West Virginia and Kentucky should be first in line to be retrained to get those jobs. But the fossil fuel industry will squash any effort to do so and cling to the \u201ccoal\u201d mentality so long as it benefits them. Of course dumb Donnie sees things only one way and that is where the money comes from. Since fossil fuel companies supported him and he is in bed with folks like Tillerson what other outcome would you expect? Get them miners back in the mines, push coal, foul our air, take advantage of the people of Appalachia starve them and make them dependent. That is tRump\u2019s business plan. What tore me up is the the picture of the guy in the wheel chair being pushed by his daughter. He waited 18 years for workers comp after a roof had fallen on him? And we should want to perpetuate this industry? Those that support tRump should be made to go to Appalachia, see the destructions the mines have left and maybe try to live the life of a miner. I say give the miners a first shot at retraining and a job in a clean industry. ", "child": "", "name": "2485_10", "parent": "2485", "title": ""}
