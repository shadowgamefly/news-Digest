{"content": "The difficulty with \u201cfalse news\u201d is that a lot of perfectly reputable news sources are often conduits for their sources\u2019 propaganda. My favorite recent juxtaposition of headlines was a from the New York Times and BBC web sites that appeared almost next to one another in my news feed. The New York Times headline said something like \u201cVenezuelans Rally against Government \u201d, the BBC headline was \u201cCompeting rallies in Venezuela\u201d. And it wasn\u2019t just the headlines. If you read the New York Times article there is no mention of the supporter\u2019s rally, only that the government called for supporters to demonstrate their support. There were, however, extensive interviews with the anti-government demonstrators talking about their grievances against the government. People need critical reading skills regardless of the source. But mostly they need to take anything published in the media with a large dose of salt. There is a whole industry out their trying to manipulate those messages. Its called public relations. Reporters have neither the time nor interest in vetting every interesting story, unless they think the vetting will make it more interesting to their audience.
