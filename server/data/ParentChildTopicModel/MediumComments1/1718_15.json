{"content": "Awesome, thank you. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety for several years since my dad passed away suddenly. I just moved to NYC, too, from the Midwest. My therapist told me, \u201cCan I be honest with you? I don\u2019t know anyone with that much anxiety who would pick up and move across the country like this.\" That was the most motivating thing I\u2019ve ever heard regarding my anxiety. I did have a panic attack on the subway, too, and others along the way. But on days when I successfully manage my anxiety, I feel truly motivated at what life can be like. When I imagine mental peace for an entire day, two days, even weeks or months\u2026 I know you\u2019re right: It will be hard, but it will be worth it.
