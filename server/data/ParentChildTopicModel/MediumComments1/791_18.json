{"content": "I have been using Asana and it appears to be overshooting and getting too many Trello-like features and vice-versa. Jira is really very developer-centric (workflows) whereas Trello can be applied to anything. It\u2019s a great conference call tool since the updates are realtime.

There are plenty of vacuums out there. ", "child": "", "name": "791_18", "parent": "791", "title": ""}
