{"content": "I can\u2019t really disagree with much of what you say. It doesn\u2019t really change the fact that the H-1b is being abused. The tell-tale sign that proves it is one that you should be able to see for yourself. The justification in the tech industry for lobbying for more of these visas is that they can\u2019t find the talent they need. Yet the salaries for those positions have not moved much in several years. So something doesn\u2019t match. If there is a shortage, prices should rise, but they don\u2019t. So there is no real shortage, there is a glut caused by importing foreign labor. And the Indian labor is very much a mixed bag. I have worked with many people from India that are here on the H-1b. While there are some that are very technically capable and talented, they are not in the majority. Most of them come with a resume of at least a bachelor\u2019s, sometimes a master\u2019s, that they obtained at Indian universities, and yet they struggle with even the most basic computer and networking tools and techniques. I have caught them many times using terrible techniques. They Google an issue and copy and paste some code without having ANY understanding of what the code actually does. They write functions full of 7, 8, 9, nested \u201cif\u201d statements and so long you can\u2019t figure out what is happening in them, and fail to write tests for them. I have even caught them submitting documentation with whole pages plagiarized from some web site. It is certainly not all of them, but more than the truly talented ones. The H-1b program is being used to find bodies to fill seats, and being done to avoid the real cost of qualified professionals. It hurts everyone, including talented immigrants (that we need) who come here to work using that program or other means. I don\u2019t reject those guys out-of-hand when technical recruiters send them to me, but I no longer trust their screening process. Instead I make sure I thoroughly vet any candidates myself so that I am confident they can fill the position and meet my expectations. ", "child": "", "name": "442_8", "parent": "442", "title": ""}
