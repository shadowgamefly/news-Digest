{"content": "I agree that Musk is proof that being a polymath (or an \u201cexpert-generalist\u201d) is a viable path. However, I believe you would be making the same mistake we have always made. Believing that one shoe size fits all. All we can truly garner from this is that generality can work equally as great as being specific. If we condemn anyone for saying \u201cto succeed, you must specialise\u201d, why then would we turn around and say \u201cto succeed, you must generalise\u201d? They are both built on the premise that there\u2019s a \u2018formula\u2019 for success. Truth is; it\u2019s personalised. Nonetheless, great post. Thank\u2019s for showing these fundamentals. Very valuable. ", "child": "", "name": "1338_7", "parent": "1338", "title": ""}
