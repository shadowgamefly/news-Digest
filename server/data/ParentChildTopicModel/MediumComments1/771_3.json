{"content": "I like your general hypothesis, but a lot of the article doesn\u2019t quite \u201cclick\u201d for me. I\u2019d prefer removing 1/2 of the article and replacing it with a couple examples of real world motion. I think simplifying your argument will make it stronger and more convincing. An easy example is something like a person walking across a room\u200a\u2014\u200athey start and finish their movement walking slowly, and they walk more quickly in the middle. The human brain is wired to expect objects to accelerate and decelerate when they move, so this is why easing looks better than linear motion.
