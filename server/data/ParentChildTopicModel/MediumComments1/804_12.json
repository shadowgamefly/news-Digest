{"content": "Great job creating Pinecone! Your write-up reminds me of the programming language course I took during my second year in University. There is only one big project in the course, write your own programming language. The process is pretty much the same, the professor at the time ruled we shall all use Ruby to write. I ended up creating a compiled language very similar to C++. I recalled it was not very difficult to actually code, it\u2019s the part before, getting all the concept (especially the tree) around my head and deciding what and how the language behaved. I swear the source code still exists in one of many hard disks at home. Only should I dig through all of them. Good times. ", "child": "", "name": "804_12", "parent": "804", "title": ""}
