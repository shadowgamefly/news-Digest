{"content": "Thanks Ravi Shankar Rajan! I totally agree that consistently taken small steps, or mini, daily goals, are the secret to success. I do like to make sure that those small steps are contributing to bigger, long range goals so that I know I\u2019m going to keep moving in the right direction. I guess it really comes back to making sure you\u2019re setting goals that will keep you motivated and in action. Any improperly set goal, no matter the timeframe, is just setting ourselves up to fail. That feeling of satisfaction when you complete something each day is going to help you progress, which is a big win in my books\u00a0:) ", "child": "", "name": "583_1", "parent": "583", "title": ""}
