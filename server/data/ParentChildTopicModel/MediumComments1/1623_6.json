{"content": "I estimated $90 for my weekend hike (27 miles Friday, 27 Saturday, 20 Sunday). I finished my second state on the AT! Officially done with Georgia and North Carolina! Here\u2019s money reality: $50 shuttle $4.43 McD bfast Friday $13.35 on McDonald\u2019s Sunday (10 piece nugs large size, Big Mac, extra med fry. I ate it all) $21.83 for gas $5.34 for Gatorade and sour gummies $94.95, which is not far off. I\u2019m probably going to buy an entire pizza for dinner tonight. I\u2019m so hungry. BUT- this coming weekend is ANOTHER hike wherein I will hit 500 miles hiked since January, finish my 3rd state, turn 30, AND get to see ponies!
