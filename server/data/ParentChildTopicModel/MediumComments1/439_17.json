{"content": "Michele Bachmann, as with all Trump supporters, needs to face facts: if she wants to spout off about an \u201cAnti-Christ\u201d, the finger is better pointed to Trump and his henchmen. There isn\u2019t a true follower of Jesus among them for all their hypocritical \u201cscripture\u201d recitals. Their policies against most of the citizens of this country show that\u200a\u2014\u200athey are all hateful. Miss Michele is just another Trump/Republican mouthpiece spouting lies and making up conspiracy stories. She\u2019s a disgrace to women and the true practice of Christianity.
