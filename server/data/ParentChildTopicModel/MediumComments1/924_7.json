{"content": "Hey Tristan, thanks for the great article, i enjoyed it a lot. Imho FB Pixel tracking should be implemented in the first stage as well. It only takes minutes and the longer it can collect data, the more valueable it will be in the long run, especially regarding Lookalike Audiences. You mentioned marketing attribution as well, which approach would you recommend? As far as i know the tools out there are not tracking but statistically calculating the attribution. Is there any better solution out there? Thanks in advance \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb ", "child": "", "name": "924_7", "parent": "924", "title": ""}
