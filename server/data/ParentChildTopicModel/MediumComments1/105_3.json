{"content": "The garment in question is a black hooded sweatshirt, printed with competing images of a map of the United States, Martin Luther King, and a starred-and-striped lightning bolt. It comes from Milan-based designer Neil Barrett and retails for $569. (Import taxes included.) Normally I\u2019d be all the way in on NBA players wearing Barrett, who\u2019s been a certified king of this kind of bold leisurewear for more than a decade. And while I appreciate the sentiment of wearing an ultra-patriotic hoodie at this contested moment in American politics, it must be said: This sweatshirt is trash. MLK? A hero. America? 6/10, would patriate again. And lightning bolts? Reliably great. But throw them together, and you get a hoodie that\u2019s trying too hard, worn by two players doing the same. (If you really want to signal \u201cI am wealthy and will wear literally anything, but I have good taste,\u201d try this one. Way better.) So: Who wore it best? No one. No one did.", "child": "", "name": "105_3", "parent": "105", "title": ""}
