{"content": "Anyone who has reached the wisdom to write so beautifully\u200a\u2014\u200aand personally\u200a\u2014\u200ahas already accumulated some defense against the trolls that are prodded out of their holes by the fire of your words, so I won\u2019t tell you to ignore the Russian operative with the phony woman\u2019s name (bad) or the \u201cbenign patriarch\u201d who is so \u2018worried\u2019 about your son, but never expresses an iota of empathy for the incestuously raped daughter of that son\u2019s grandfather (worse). I know your defenses aren\u2019t perfect and some of the acidic bile that wells up from their emptiness to spew from their lips may pockmark you with burns, but that tiny stinging is nothing in the face of what you\u2019ve already shouldn\u2019t have had to endure. So I won\u2019t waste more of our precious time acknowledging their existence, except to be grateful for the important counterweight against them that your words act as. Small and stupid as their hatred is, it comes from blindness and an inability to feel empathy (i.e. to be human) and deserves pity. You are a remarkable writer, thinker, prevailer, connector of history\u2019s forgotten dots. I look forward to reading more from you. ", "child": "", "name": "488_12", "parent": "488", "title": ""}
