{"content": "Tom Cotton in his election campaigns touted his military experience. He\u2019s proven what a coward he is- running away from a seven year old with a question. Maybe Tom can only be \u201cbrave\u201d with a gun and a line of armed soldiers. All the Republicans running from and hiding from constituents are all just as scared of unarmed liberals and children as Tom Cotton. They are afraid of women which is why they fight equality of pay and force draconian laws on our bodies. I prefer Toby\u2019s bravery in asking hard questions of elected officials. Let\u2019s all give him a shoutout and sign the petition on Change.org to protect PBS. ", "child": "", "name": "1070_23", "parent": "1070", "title": ""}
