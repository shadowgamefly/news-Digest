{"content": "We struggle to fit tremendously complex issues into the proverbial nutshell. It doesn\u2019t work very well. A small US left exists, but they\u2019ve been drown out by liberals for years. Indeed, our left is so lacking in charisma that liberal media have overlooked them entirely for the past 20+ years\u200a\u2014\u200aother than the charming, visor-hatted figure of the working man. While there is mention of a \u201clabor left,\u201d it appears that the US version is limited to protecting the advantages of middle class workers within our capitalist system. It\u2019s not clear where (or if) the Democrats come in. This is one of those boring issues that make eyes glaze over. Most voting choices come down to economic issues.The Dem voting base had long consisted of the \u201cmasses\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200apoor and middle class, for the common good. The Clinton administration split this base wide apart twenty years ago, and the past eight years confirmed that this split is permanent.This would indicate that Democrats are over for the foreseeable future. If the US had a left of any size, they would have been shining a spotlight on our poverty crisis as proof of the grave failures of our deregulated capitalism. But we haven\u2019t found a way to capitalize on US poverty in an entertaining fashion. Media remain focused on marketing to middle class consumers and campaign donors. Political discussion has largely been reduced to a fund-raising infomercial. ", "child": "", "name": "263_14", "parent": "263", "title": ""}
