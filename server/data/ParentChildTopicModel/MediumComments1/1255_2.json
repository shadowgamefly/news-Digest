{"content": "I mean, how many churches have you been inside? Old churches have a bauplan: a classic cross shape, a long central aisle, vaulted ceiling, altar at one end, and every nook and cranny is festooned with candles and statues. So many churches, all so similar. If your brain could not separate the memories of the inside of each new church you\u2019d been in, then each time you stepped into a church, all the memories of all the churches you\u2019d ever been in would turn on, merging into one melange of churchness. But you clearly know when you\u2019re in Notre Dame and when you\u2019re in St Paul\u2019s. Without the brain\u2019s ability to separate these very similar but not identical collections of \u201cstuff in a church\u201d into separate memories, we\u2019d be hopelessly confused.", "child": "", "name": "1255_2", "parent": "1255", "title": ""}
