{"content": "Great list and great blocking out of post-1997 episodes (to a point). The list fails because it ultimately gave the same #1 episode as EW did a decade ago. Also, Treehouse of Horror episodes on a list like this are usually a waste with the exception of ToH V (The Shinning) and VIII (I voted for Kodos). Also, where is \u201cThe City of New York versus Homer Simpson\u201d? Okay I\u2019ll stop because it appears I\u2019m imitating every internet fanboy there is. Good work.
