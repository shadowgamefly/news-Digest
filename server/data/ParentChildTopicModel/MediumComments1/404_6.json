{"content": "I\u2019m am wondering why there is all this outrage. Seriously. Does anyone believe ANYTHING that comes out of the White House? The media needs to stop hesitating to use the word \u201cliar\u201d when it comes to Spicer, Conway, and 45 rather than walking on egg shells with terms like \u201c untruth, falsehood, and misstatement.\u201d Spicer himself claims that what he says does not represent his own beliefs. His job is to be a surrogate and say what the president wants said, in a manner that pleases the emperor. Thus, this holocost denial is what his boss believes, which is a LIE and exactly what you would expect to hear from Spicer. No doubt after thus, the Holocaust Museum will have less federal funding than Planned Parenthood. ", "child": "", "name": "404_6", "parent": "404", "title": ""}
