{"content": "Hey Baratunde, first of all, good meeting you at SaS last year. That was a good way to spend the few days after the election. I get where you\u2019re coming from, but I think you misread my original statement. A few things: I outlined a hypothesis, certainly not THE truth. On the off chance that it\u2019s true, we need to channel more energy into the non-obvious, boring moves in government that will be important later. That\u2019s my point. But nothing in what I said asserts the theory as what\u2019s really going on. It\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s in the heads of Trump\u2019s inner circle.Protests are an amazing, important part of resisting moves by our government. I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve stood up. But we need to be wary of people assuming that\u2019s ALL they need to do, just as they assumed that all they needed to do during the election was write three sentences on Facebook and call it a day. Movements include protests, and by no means should we stop. But movements are much more than protests.By no means is the intent to marginalize the importance of the immigration ban on those affected. It\u2019s wrong, illegal, immoral and should be stopped. But we also need to recognize the possibility that it\u2019s a piece of a much larger puzzle. We need to stop not only the current issue, but structural chances that make the next immigration ban, or Muslim registry, or infringement on LGBT rights, easier to execute. I think we\u2019re on the same side here. ", "child": "", "name": "448_10", "parent": "448", "title": ""}
