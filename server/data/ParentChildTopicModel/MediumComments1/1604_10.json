{"content": "Jonas, I can relate to your situation. For wanting to be likes and not be considered a \u2018bad guy\u2019 I have often let myself be pushed over and walked and trampled upon. And the ones I supposedly helped weren\u2019t even sympathetic or grateful! I am all for carefully arranged boundaries and stepping stones, and making them clear to all around you. But on a less serious note, Rory\u2019s actions are exactly how my 9-year-old niece plays on my emotions (often when her parents don\u2019t accede to her numerous requests). I know I shouldn\u2019t cave in, but then, I have no kids and she is like the kid I don\u2019t have so I give in. Only to kick my self in the butt later (figuratively of course!). But when Rory grows older, you\u2019ll miss those times. And I will miss those times with my niece when she grows up too. So I laugh and grit my teeth at the same time:) It works out in the end (I hope!) ", "child": "", "name": "1604_10", "parent": "1604", "title": ""}
