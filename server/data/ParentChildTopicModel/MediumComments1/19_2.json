{"content": "From a machine learning (ML) point of view, having a strong definition of distance between entities \u2014 or, better yet, multiple definitions of distance \u2014 can be a powerful tool. Amongst other ML algorithms, mathematically defined distance enables the application of clustering algorithms to a set of entities, allowing them to be grouped together in different ways.", "child": "", "name": "19_2", "parent": "19", "title": ""}
