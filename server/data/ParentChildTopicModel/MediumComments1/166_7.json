{"content": "I do believe a lot of people might share articles, forward them or retweet/republish and simply don\u2019t know how to (or that they should) credit the original author. Or they don\u2019t know who the original author is. They may even suppose you were posting an article you found too. A lot of uncles and moms on Facebook are prone to that. But it\u2019s sad when those who know better reproduce it as their own. It is criminal when someone goes so far as to create fake dates on their own website. You\u2019re right, its not \u2018clever\u2019 so much as a byproduct of a lazy lack of morals. I don\u2019t know this Vestil fella but it seems to me this is one of Thailand\u2019s \u201cDigital Nomads\u201d. This is a loose collection of usually younger folks who would-be a kind of Amway/Scientology cult if they had the discipline. The idea is they become online entrepreneurs and live holiday lifestyles in Thailand where their earnings can afford more due to exchange rates. Usually they create these \u2018Startup Success\u2019 Brands about themselves and their life-beating keys to success, how they made it to a luxury lifestyles and a 4-hour work week. (they seem inspired by Timothy Ferris\u2019 books though I don\u2019t believe any relationship exists beyond that). Like some multi-level marketing schemes\u200a\u2014\u200athe 2nd best idea is to have lots of hits, views and subscribers who may buy a book or bottle of vitamins through a link. But the main idea (like so much MLM) is to be the guy at the top of the pyramid. He wants as many fans becoming converts to emulate his lifestyle, show up in Thailand with their laptops asking how they can do it too. He has a seminar and so on. Well, again, I don\u2019t know if Mikey Vestil is actually part of that world but all to say that the \u2018digital nomads\u2019 are easily tempted into copy-pasting and attributing it to themselves for as long as it works. I suspect most people wouldn\u2019t even bother doing the work you did. They sorta count on that. ", "child": "", "name": "166_7", "parent": "166", "title": ""}
