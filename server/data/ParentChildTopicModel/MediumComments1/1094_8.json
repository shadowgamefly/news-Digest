{"content": "Actually its Casey Quinlan that refuses to understand much of anything that doesn\u2019t have a Marxist origin. That which took at least eight years for Obama\u2019s so called Affordable Healthcare plan to begin its catastrophic financial failure. Obama PROMISED that we\u2019d keep our doctors, keep our plans and that it would cost less. For the past eight years I got laid off a half a dozen times (because of Obama\u2019s initiatives) and could NOT afford health care (period). When we were facing OBamaCare\u2019s initiation Obama invited conservative law makers to meet and give him some ideas, at the end of the meeting Obama simply gave us his middle finger. One of the conservatives ideas was to tax those that could afford it based on their income level to provide for those that can\u2019t.\u00a0Casey, stop the Marxist lies. We will provide for those that are truly poor and as a form of vote buying like the left has done so damn artfully since 1965. ", "child": "", "name": "1094_8", "parent": "1094", "title": ""}
