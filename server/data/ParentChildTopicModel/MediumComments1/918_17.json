{"content": "I really appreciate the time you took to write about your experience. It\u2019s incredibly important for women to share their stories. It\u2019s been both fascinating and frustrating to watch how thin that line can be between being seen as too aggressive or putting yourself in a position to be taken advantage of. My wake up moment was my husband getting diagnosed with cancer in his early 30\u2019s. I was 8 weeks pregnant. I am so grateful he\u2019s in remission but also as a family we have perspective and clarity on what\u2019s important to us. Life is short. It\u2019s too short to let people make you feel less than you are. The message that\u2019s underlying your whole post is the confidence you feel in your vision for your career and the objectives you have for your life. I have those same conversations where I could be made to doubt my choices, but I know 100% I get up every day to make the most of my time on this planet doing what I love to do and spending time with the people I care about.
