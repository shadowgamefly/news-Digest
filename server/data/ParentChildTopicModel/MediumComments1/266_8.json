{"content": "The issue with this, as others have written here, is that these views don\u2019t come up unless it is a Republican-related issue or candidate. Where were the subtle jabs about the Democratic primary being rigged? Where were the tie-ins to some small businesses being ruined by the Affordable Care Act? Where were the comments about President Obama stumping for a candidate for months, and using taxpayer money to do so? I say \u2018stick to sports\u2019 when I am being force-fed one political ideology. If there is a particular issue that comes up, and it makes its way into an article, so be it. When I am consistently being beaten over the head with the same viewpoint, across a medium, what alternative is there besides asking that you stick to the topic that I associate with \u2018you\u2019? I guess sports writers have the right to cover these things regardless of the audience and their views, just like the audience has the right to look elsewhere for information, but that seems like a broken system. I can love the coverage of sports and not want a different arena to venture in. That is not an unfair stance. ", "child": "", "name": "266_8", "parent": "266", "title": ""}
