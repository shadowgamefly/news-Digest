{"content": "Damn straight. I\u2019ve been a single mom for fourteen years, thanks to a domestic violence divorce. If it weren\u2019t for food stamps and government Care Source insurance, we would have starved to death long ago. My youngest is fourteen. My daughter is twenty three, and still lives with me because I\u2019ve been fighting Stage IV colonrectal cancer, and they think I\u2019m gonna be ok, but until I was diagnosed I had to work two jobs sometimes fourteen hours a day, and barely kept a roof over our heads. She works at a warehouse full time and can\u2019t move out or go to college because she needs my disability and I need her paycheck. We\u2019ve gone without electric sometimes for months at a time, and my kids only owned one pair of shoes at a time pretty much their whole lives. The attitude of some so called Christians and Conservatives makes me sick. The anger and hate\u2026.and when they say something on facebook and you confront them its \u201cOh, not you. I didn\u2019t mean you\u2026you deserve help. You\u2019ve worked for it\u201d Like other kids don\u2019t deserve to own shoes or go to bed with a full stomach? My kids grew up scared of eviction any minute, scared they would get their only pair of shoes messed up. More than once they had to stay home from school while I struggled to hand wash their pants in the bathtub and dry them with a blowdryer or tape togather shoes with duct tape. We made ramen by candlelight with hot tap water because no electric. I believe there is a God, and some day so called \u201canti-free ride\u201d people will have to answer to Him\u2026 Kudos\u2026..good writing! Compliments from one barefoot to another!
