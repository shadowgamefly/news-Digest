{"content": "I stopped to consider if Penn State might have snuck in if they had beaten Pitt and finished season with only one loss, a big 10 championship, and victories over Ohio State and Wisconsin, but I came to the conclusion that no, they would not have gotten a top 4 spot. The same four teams would have been in the playoff with a 12\u20131 Penn State sitting at number 5. Giving Penn State a ticket to the playoffs would have meant two Big 10 teams and no Pac 12 team and the human committee (though possibly not a computer algorithm) would not have agreed to those dynamics. This means that Penn State was never close to getting in. They were always a distant 5th. ", "child": "", "name": "1665_8", "parent": "1665", "title": ""}
