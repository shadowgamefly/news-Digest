{"content": "I think what fades away is not reality (something exists) but consciousness (state of being awake). Your awareness of what is in the sense of how you interpret what is actually happening around you. It\u2019s almost as if you cease to care \u201cunwillingly\u201d by an outside/imposed force. I don\u2019t find that reassuring personally. It\u2019s an ego thing, the need to be conscious is also a need to control awareness. However, if it makes the physical pain go away, then maybe it\u2019s ok. Physical pain can be maddening if unbearable. Egos don\u2019t usually like physical pain unless it is done with some form of consent. Fading away is not my thing at all as I have found out with various substances. But I wished I could get more of the sleeping kind. ", "child": "", "name": "554_6", "parent": "554", "title": ""}
