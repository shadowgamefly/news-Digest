{"content": "This is nothing short of Tabloid TV. What I use to pass by at the grocery store cashier on the magazine rack is now on national TV. Trump and his family are nothing but \u201ctabloid news\u201d, sensational in a lurid and vulgar way. The publication prints fake news, just like the new contract that NBC and Trump are about to inter into... \u201cThe Real First Family of DC\u201d. What a joke, and they want to run it during Memorial Day. A day on which those who died in active military service are remembered..How disgraceful to our veterans this is. I have never purchased one of those tabloid magazine on may way through the check out stand at my local grociery store, and I\u2019m definately not going to watch any special show that NBC may run on Memorial Day\u2026 Bill ", "child": "", "name": "695_22", "parent": "695", "title": ""}
