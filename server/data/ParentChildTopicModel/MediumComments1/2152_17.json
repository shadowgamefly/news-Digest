{"content": "Thank you for your response. This really helped me. There is a small change i had to make for the FrameLayout that holds the PrefernceScreen when i used @+id/list_container i got android:i java.lang.RuntimeException: Content has view with id attribute android.R.id.list_container\u2019 that is not a ViewGroup class So i changed the id from android:id=\u201d@+id/list_container\u201d to android:id=\u201d@android:id/list_container\u201d. It works perfectly fine except i get a warning from android studio saying @android:id/list_container only works in API level 24. But it works perfectly on devices less than API level 24.
