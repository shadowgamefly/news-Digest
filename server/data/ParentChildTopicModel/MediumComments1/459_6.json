Second, you are wrong about your claim, please educate yourself o9n the facts of the clause, this will help: The Foreign Emoluments Clause and the Chief Executive by Andy Grewal\u00a0:: SSRNThe 2016 Presidential election brought widespread attention to a part of the Constitution, the Foreign Emoluments\u2026poseidon01.ssrn.com A small preview: However, consistent with the principal definition, an almost endless number of legal authorities show that when \u201cemoluments\u201d is used in connection with the description of an officer or employee, it refers to compensation for services performed. In Hoyt v. United States, for example, the Supreme Court specifically defined emoluments as \u201cembracing every species of compensation or pecuniary profit derived from a discharge of the duties of the office.\u201d In Mclean v. United States, the Supreme Court again emphasized the connection between emoluments and offices, saying that \u201cemoluments are but expressions of value used to give complete recompense to a deserving officer.\u201d And in Hill v. United States the Supreme Court affirmed its office-related definition of emoluments, concluding that \u201ca sum collected by a clerk for a service not pertaining to his office\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was not a fee or emolument. Given that the Foreign Emoluments Clause also speaks of emoluments in connection with offices under foreign law, one can sensibly apply these Supreme Court interpretations to the clause.
