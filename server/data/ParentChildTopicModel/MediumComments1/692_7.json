{"content": "Even in epic fantasy stories, though, it\u2019s questionable how much detailed worldbuilding improves a work. Tolkien is revered among worldbuilding obsessives for going to such lengths as inventing complete languages for his fictional races before even writing the story. Contrast that with George R. R. Martin, who famously describes himself as a \u201cgardener\u201d instead of an \u201carchitect,\u201d and who simply makes up some fake words and lets the reader infer the rest. Readers may prefer one series to the other for a variety of reasons, but I doubt one reader in a million prefers The Lord of the Rings because dwarven has more realistic grammar than Dothraki.", "child": "", "name": "692_7", "parent": "692", "title": ""}
