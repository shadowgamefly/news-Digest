{"content": "\u2013This guy is stealing all my ideas! Well OK they\u2019re no one\u2019s ideas, or perhaps they\u2019re everyone\u2019s in this specific field, as we\u2019re all growing in parallel, together unknowingly. \u2013Befriending yourself, awareness as a catalyst, accelerating the liberation from our storyline, our innermost self as plastic, multidimensional, a proactive loop creating a breakthrough, a threshold effect poetically called a quantum leap, etc. I already retrace most of these ideas to where I got them, who murmured them to me, and I could search and retrace their genealogy\u00a0further. Now, what one wants to do in this context is to synthesize, expose and expand them in its authenticity, that is, one\u2019s own approach, voice and tone. Then if we\u2019re thoughtful, perhaps our nuances and subtleties will create new ideas, and again, a forward loop. A fresh paradigm. ", "child": "", "name": "1880_10", "parent": "1880", "title": ""}
