{"content": "Zeke is a Survivor superfan. He was on a YouTube irl game, Survivor: Brooklyn, before his stint on the real deal. He wrote on the Survivor podcast/media network RHAP as the \u2018Gay Correspondent\u2019 taking Survivor and writing about it through the LGBTQ lens. He comes off as an ambassador for the show because he is. He is a huge fan and loves the game and I think his reaction (and CBS\u2019s) should be commended. It was a shitty situation, and Varner will live with that shame forever, but it turned into something quite beautiful. ", "child": "", "name": "698_6", "parent": "698", "title": ""}
