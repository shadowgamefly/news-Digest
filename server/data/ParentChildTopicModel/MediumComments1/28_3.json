{"content": "Westbrook has told many, many lies this season. The silvery string connecting them like kayfabe: They\u2019re not really intended to deceive, nor do they suggest a lack of respect for the truth. They\u2019re performative. They invite you to be part of the gag. Russ\u2019s falsehoods are inclusive; they are, in actuality, a deeper form of truth. Russ saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like Kevin,\u201d would tell you exactly that fact. Russ claiming, with a semi-straight face, that he said \u201cJamie\u201d instead of \u201cKyrie\u201d tells you that not only does he not like Kevin, he\u2019s uncomfortable admitting it flat out, but nonetheless wants you to know. It is, in short, petty. And pettiness is the most human, relatable thing about Russell Westbrook: Purveyor of Superhuman Feats.", "child": "", "name": "28_3", "parent": "28", "title": ""}
