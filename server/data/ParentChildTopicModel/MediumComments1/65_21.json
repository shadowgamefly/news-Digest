{"content": "This sustainability truly is remarkable, but because it\u2019s about, basically, \u201cmaking greatness normal\u201d it tends to get overlooked, as most \u201cnormal\u201d things are. I am biased in this regard, since my all-time favourite player is John Stockton, who (along with Malone) helped define the idea of \u201csustained greatness over a very, very long period of time.\u201d To be fair, Kareem was the first to do so. So much so, in fact, that when I look at that as well as his numbers, including championships\u2026I wonder why HE isn\u2019t considered the GOAT. This current Cavs team reminds me a lot of the last Miami team James was on. That team, however, had a much better defensive scheme from a much better coach during their championship years; so much so that one has to ask: Are we sure Tyronne Lue is a good coach?
