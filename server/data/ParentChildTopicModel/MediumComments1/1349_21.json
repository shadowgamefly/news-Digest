{"content": "Not surprising move given the meeting she had within the last week with the industry lobbyist. As GQ reminded us: WARREN: Mrs. DeVos, do you have any experience in running a bank? BETSY DEVOS: Senator, I do not. WARREN: Have you ever managed or overseen a trillion dollar loan program. DEVOS: I have not. WARREN: How about a billion dollar loan program? DEVOS: I have not. WARREN: Okay. So no experience managing a program like this. How about participating in one? I think it is important for the person who is in charge of our financial aid programs to understand what it is like for students and their families who are struggling to pay for college. Mrs. DeVos, have you ever taken out a student loan from the federal government to help pay for college? DEVOS: I have not. WARREN: Have any of your children had to borrow money in order to go to college? DEVOS: They have been fortunate not to. WARREN: Have you had any personal experience with a Pell Grant? DEVOS: Not personal experience, but certainly friends and students with whom I have worked. WARREN: So you have no personal experience with college financial aid or management of higher education.
