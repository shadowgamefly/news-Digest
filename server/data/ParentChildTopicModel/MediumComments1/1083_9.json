{"content": "I looked at the picutre of the men around that table deciding critical elements of women\u2019s health care coverage. I wrote my representative, who is a republican, and expressed my outrage at the audacity and arrogance involved in that meeting which excluded women from any input into their own concerns about women\u2019s health care. I also told him that I would work against his re-election with a vengeance. And I do mean with a vengeance. I will do what ever I can to get someone else elected to represent me and all the other women in my district. On top of that obscene picture of those men I have lambasted my rep in regard to the lie that he and other republicans are fiscally conservative. When the republicans collectively tolerate tRump\u2019s wreckless spending by his repeated junkets to Florida so he can play golf almost every weekend and flaunt the need for security for his family\u2019s business trips which I feel they should be funding themeselves, they cannot claim they are fiscally conservative. I am not what I would call a fiscal conservative, I am personally frugal and I spend wisely. I do not always by cheap but I do buy good. I do believe in taking care of those who need help and are less fortunate than I am. Certainly, I do know a fiscal conservative would not and should not tolerate someone who has a lavish life style and thinks the taxpayers should fund it. tRump can stay in DC and his family members can pay their own way on private business. Any one who is truly fiscally conservative should be saying the same thing. They need to start showing some outrage and put a stop to the out-of-bounds spending that tRump thinks he is entitled to.
