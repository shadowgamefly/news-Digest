{"content": "Very interesting and enlightening article. Although, I\u2019m bugged as to the comment that \u201cJack of all trades. Master of none\u201d is but a myth. The point of transferring core principles across fields is a valid and proves to be a highly effective one. However, that seems to apply only regarding fields where ideas and idea combinations are concerned. On the other hand, fields that primarily base on direct personal physical involvement with very different instruments don\u2019t seem to benefit well from this expert-generalist approach. One can hardly extract much if any from expert physical coordination in football playing and apply it to another very, very different physical coordination area such as piano playing. Yes, you may be able to get some good ideas from football playing and apply to piano playing, but the physical coordination itself is not transferable, or so it seems. Also, the capacity to extract core intellectual principles across fields to invent new combinations would hardly transfer well to practices that require mastery that can only be realized through hours and hours of specialized practice, such as guitar playing. Nevertheless, it\u2019d be interesting to see an expert-generalist trying to learn to play the guitar as expertly and quickly as a specialist, such as Segovia.
