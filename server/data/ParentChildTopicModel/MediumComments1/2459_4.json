{"content": "It feels bad to read a book by a straight cis man about misogyny. It feels bad when this book contains some relatively graphic depictions of sexual assault. This is par for the course, when the course is reading books and the par is the Western canon. What feels worse is having this man\u2019s work recommended to you, over and over, by men who have talked over you, talked down to you, coerced you into certain things, physically forced you into others, and devalued your opinion in ways too subtle to be worth explaining in an essay (as in the interviews, where the hideous men are the only characters we hear from). Either these Wallace-recommending men don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re the hideous men in question, or they think self-awareness is the best anyone could expect from them.", "child": "", "name": "2459_4", "parent": "2459", "title": ""}
