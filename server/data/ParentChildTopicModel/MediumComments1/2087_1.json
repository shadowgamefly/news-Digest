{"content": "Anyway, as the Duquesne coaching search dragged on and I appeared to be the only candidate willing to accept the job, I slowly started talking myself into my chances. The tiny corner of the internet that I occupy rallied behind me, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette endorsed me, and most importantly, at least 10 people sent me emails that were addressed to \u201cCoach Titus.\u201d Honestly, once things got to that point, it no longer mattered whether I got the job. What mattered is that strangers were calling me \u201cCoach,\u201d which is all I ever really wanted. Because as has been proved by Grant Hill calling Bill Raftery \u201cCoach,\u201d even though Raftery never accomplished anything of significance as a coach and hasn\u2019t coached since 1981, getting tagged with the \u201cCoach\u201d label is something that you carry for life.", "child": "", "name": "2087_1", "parent": "2087", "title": ""}
