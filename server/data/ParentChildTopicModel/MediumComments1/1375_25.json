{"content": "This was a well written article, but you are on one side of a topic with much gray area. First, defining the word \u201csharing\u201d as always meaning \u201cwithout monetary consideration\u201d is just not correct. Merriam-Webster includes \u201cto partake of, use, experience, occupy, or enjoy with others\u201d as part of the definition and nowhere mentions \u201cfree\u201d. Time-sharing, the process of co-ownership of a property is an example of sharing. Your own example of the farmers sharing access to a reservoir would include monetary value in that farm land outside of this arrangement would have less value than land that has access rights. So please do not allow the placing of monetary value on anything \u201cshared\u201d to automatically be considered deceptive and evil. My point is not to defend Uber\u2019s business model, but to remind you that both drivers and riders participate freely. I gave up my car a year ago in part because of the simplicity and reliability of Uber and Lyft to provide alternate transport. My drivers have included students looking to make spending money by driving between class time, commuters who make extra income by picking up fares along their route, permanent job seekers in between positions, and new immigrants learning English and finding that driving for Uber gave them an excellent opportunity to interact with native speakers that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to accomplish. My point is that Uber or any voluntary sharing platform is not the Evil Empire enslaving the serfs. Yes, they want to profit. Yes, Uber will continually get more efficient, even if that means eliminating need for drivers. So what? I\u2019ve not yet met a driver that intended for Uber to be their lifelong career.
