{"content": "Jake Poses this is a great piece of advice. I have been a hiring manager myself for a few years, and I often noticed that I tended to talk a lot through the interviewing process. In retrospect, I think I was trying to justify the areas that made me uncomfortable with the job. This, of course, is a big mistake I learned the hard way. I wrote a piece specifically around hiring for a UX team that you might find interesting. Have a look if you get a chance as I would love your thoughts as well. Cheers!
