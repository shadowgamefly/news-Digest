{"content": "Really great article. I appreciate all this, something to think about. My only quibble, is that in your grocery store example, I think you\u2019re highlighting the wrong \u2018needs\u2019 of the company. If the milk is in the back of the store, it is easier to recieve and restock from the cooler stockroom without interfering with traffic, less likely to be dropped while restocking or get warm from transport through the store. In the same way, if there is a line in pharmacy, putting it at the front of the store will cause traffic problems. It is also better for inventory control. If someone has to run through the full length of the store they are less likely to choose to steal. While I will admit that the profit motive is very possible, groceries are conservative, and that means focusing on preventing loss rather than creating gain.
