{"content": "Thank you Roseland. However you obtained your wisdom and objectivity is exactly the principles and actions that only white America\u00a0can\u00a0take\u00a0to\u00a0eradicate\u00a0racism\u00a0in\u00a0America. The NAACP long argued that racism is just as harmful to whites as it is to\u00a0minorities. If we are to live up to the principles & values the flawed writers of the US Constitution\u00a0wrote, then the original stain must end or the ominous history of other once great nations will\u00a0be\u00a0repeated. No one is truly free until racism ends. Nor can anyone critically think when the ease of blaming outsiders for all problems experienced is acceptable practice. Instead whites must look to uncover the root cause of problems and fears (as we all must)by education, curiosity & openess to individual, economic, political, or spiritual issues so real change can occur to build a better society. Again, thank you for waking. ", "child": "", "name": "534_12", "parent": "534", "title": ""}
