{"content": "I\u2019m an outsider to NCAA football\u200a\u2014\u200aI enjoy watching games here and there but have no rooting interest whatsoever. But more than anything, this seems to come down to an eyeball test by the committee. It gets really difficult to do that when there are little or no common opponents between teams. Regardless, while I would rather watch PSU play any day of the week over OSU, my eyeball tells me they are the better team too. But, despite the loss in Columbus, my eyeball also tells me Michigan is better than either of them. I think most of the college football world would be ok with an 8-team field that had automatic bids for the power 5 conf. title winners and 3 wildcards for the \u2018next\u2019 best 3 teams (however that gets determined).
