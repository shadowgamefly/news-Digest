{"content": "Interesting idea. I noticed that your clustering may correlate to the cluster concept in epidimiology. In this concept disease outbreaks and concepts of disease (such as opposing vaccination) tend to form clusters. I don\u2019t have the means or the data to validate the observed correlation but an example would be the Disneyland measles outbreak resulted in several measles outbreaks through out the US from a single imported case of measles. Disneyland probably does not fit your similarities at a distance between communities. It does however happen to be a very popular global world attraction, right next to an area that was very low in its vaccination rates, in a dense urban area, with land and air ties to other areas. If those areas also had low vaccination there would also be a measles outbreak at that location. Perhaps you can compare disease clusters to your clusters, measles being an obvious one from your study to see if there is a correlation. I suspect that your Trump City anomaly will not have a measles cluster because it is socially isolated, even if the area has low vaccination rates, and if the cluster it was surrounded by did have a measles outbreak. As far as I know there was no link between the Disney Measles and a case in NYC, but there was linkages between a measles outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community in NYC and one that occured later in the Orthodox community in Los Angeles.
