{"content": "This is why I still use email to communicate instead. There is no possibility for an intermediary to push ads in my face, because there is no middleman. Also, it supports all formats, video, pictures, text, html, whatever I want to send, it\u2019s easy to select who gets to see each message, and to \u201cshare\u201d (forward). Making software available only on the cloud (SaaS), instead of selling true ownership of the software, just opens up possibilities for businesses to pursue any unethical revenue models they wish. Ads are just one example. For another example, consider the Dutch ebay variant, which is free for everyone to use, except a random selection of products (bass gitars, cars). That\u2019s like a recruitment firm that does everything for free, except if you\u2019re asian. Because of the network effect, there are no alternatives to using the service, so the asians would just end up paying for everyone else; after all, they need jobs too, and all the good jobs are listed there since the employers don\u2019t have to pay a dime!
