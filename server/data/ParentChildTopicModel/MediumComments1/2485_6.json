{"content": "My experience in touring coal country and talking with unemployed or underemployed former miners was not that they\u2019re so stupid that they want their COAL jobs back or that most of them believed Trump when he said he would bring those jobs back. They just wanted ANY job back. They all knew that the coal industry wasn\u2019t dying because of Obama. They understood why they\u2019d lost their jobs. They just longed for any meaningful employment at all. And those $50,000 coal jobs allowed people to live quite nicely in that area. That\u2019s quite a lot for them to sacrifice. It\u2019s a great failure of our country\u2019s leaders, political and industrial, that we didn\u2019t start building alternative energy plants in this area and retrain these people in clean energy jobs. Coal miners built this country in many ways. It was the least they were owed. And we failed them. Miserably. ", "child": "", "name": "2485_6", "parent": "2485", "title": ""}
