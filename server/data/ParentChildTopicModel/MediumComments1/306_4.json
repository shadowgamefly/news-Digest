{"content": "Hi Allen, As you well know satire is a powerful force. Just now I was taken back to the \u201ccrouching under one\u2019s desk\u201d era. New To elementary school in 1955, as Russia sent chimps, then Yuri Gargarin, around planet earth, the obvious response was to train wee ones like me to duck and cover. Clearly it proved an effective deterrent to nuclear annihilation. I hope every school age child enjoys the good fortune of sitting at a desk built like a Sherman tank, the likes of which I huddled under on a regular basis 60 years ago +/. Hopefully the image of crouching children will keep Trumpty Dumpty from melting those desks. I would hate to die knowing how useless all that crouching really was! Keep up the good work.
