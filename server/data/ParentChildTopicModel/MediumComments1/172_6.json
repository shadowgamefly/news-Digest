{"content": "Your posts most certainly inspire me and I love how you track your metrics and set tangible, actionable goals. I know you\u2019ll reach 100k! For your giveaways do you host them on Medium? If so, how? I do giveaways on Instagram and they do well there but I would love to use giveaways as a way to get subscribers. Do you typically ask people to sign up for your list to enter? Or what do you do? Also, there is a huge marker of writers on Instagram. I\u2019m sure you know this and have tapped into the market but if there\u2019s anything I can do to help let me know! Thank you!
