As we learned to think within other logics, we have now difficulties to get out of the \u00ab\u00a0bubble\u00a0\u00bb. When we say \u00ab\u00a0improving everyone\u2019s lives\u00a0\u00bb we should understand\u00a0: including the Third World where people live with less than $ 100 a month.

He wrote a book \u00ab\u00a0Economics for the Common Goods\u00a0\u00bb which is worth reading. Also, I would remind you of the Ecological approach for Pope Francis\u2019s \u00ab\u00a0Common Home\u00a0\u00bb, as per the \u00ab\u00a0Laudato Si\u00a0\u00bb Encyclical in English\u00a0: http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html The facts remains that no World Leader is addressing the problem of human overcrowding on the planet.
