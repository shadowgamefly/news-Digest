{"content": "\u201cthere are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety.\u201d Trump is the only one who paid actors to show up. Do you actually believe you or anyone else is in danger while at a town hall but not while you are working, driving, golfing, or sucking Trump\u2019s ass? Do they own guns that will only fire bullets at a Town Hall but not your massage parlor across the street? Here it is: You cannot accept the criticisms of elected officials at GOP meetings because you refuse to make the connect to constituents no longer being sheep. You are loved. No way that many GOP constituents are causing waves so it must be a system of paid actors. Conway invented the Bowling Green massacre. Trump invented the Swedish attack. You are inventing \u201cenemies\u201d because if those town halls are genuine, you have absolutely no clue on forward progress. It scares the hell out of you to know in today\u2019s technology your ignorance and apathy can be immediately distributed leaving no room for excuses. Your \u201cfear\u201d of violence during a large gathering will absolutely immediately disappear for your reelection campaign. Because those are nothing like Town Halls where large groups of constituents show up in support of their candidates and to discuss issues. Do you have any idea how disgusting one has to be to invent American partisan terrorists just to avoid accountability? You are scared of your constituents because they no longer fear you.
