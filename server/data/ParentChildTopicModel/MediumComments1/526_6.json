{"content": "It is just unfortunate that the \u201cchurch\u201d in Africa isn\u2019t dying yet, instead it is growing, fuelled by poverty, hardship and ignorance. Many of the Christians are Christians because they go to church every Sunday and probably mid-week too. Because they pray everyday, read their Bibles, and hold themselves to a high moral decency. Many have forgotten that is not what it means to be a Christian. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34\u201335) It is not by solemn speech, or righteous acts, or being in place of worship. It is by your love. It is by your show of love everyone will know you are a Christian. As Christians, we have no right to act solemn or righteous or religious or better. We are Christians because Someone first loved us without conditions, requirements or condemnation. It is sad that we then develop the conditions, requirements (read your bibles, abide by the laws\u2026.) and condemnation (you atheist! you baby christian!\u2026) If Africa (and any other second, third world regions) is able to get past the economic hardship; the church as it is today, will definitely loose its hold. And maybe, just maybe, we will worship [love God and love people] in truth and in spirit [with all our heart].
