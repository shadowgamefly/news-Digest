{"content": "We have a flock of wild turkeys that regularly roam the wooded areas surrounding my home. We like to watch their antics, as they slowly strut their way across the yard, encounters between them and the cat are the most hysterical of all. But, the best story I could ever tell is about a hen that came up against a fence in our neighbor\u2019s yard. The entire flock had made it\u2019s way around or over the fence, but, this one hen could not understand what barred her way. Now, granted, it\u2019s a black plastic coated wire fence that blends in easily with the trees and grasses that fill the wooded 50 feet between us and our neighbors. But, this hen would strut her way up to the fence and bounce off, and then do it again. And again. And again. Seemingly never understanding that there was a barrier there and she needed to do something else, something different, in order to rejoin her companions. She continued this doomed path for nearly 30 minutes before we finally called our neighbor and requested they send out their yappy little dog in the hope that something would change for the silly hen. It wasn\u2019t until she was again walking toward the fence, the dog noticed her and started yapping her fool head off that the hen finally took flight, flew over the dog\u2019s head, and re-joined the flock. The next day? She was at it again. Same place, same problem. Turkeys. Not the brightest bird out there..!!\u00a0:D ", "child": "", "name": "1557_11", "parent": "1557", "title": ""}
