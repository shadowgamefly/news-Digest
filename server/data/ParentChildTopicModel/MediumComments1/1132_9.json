{"content": "Do you by any chance have a Cliff\u2019s Notes version of what his advice on debt consists of? I\u2019m kind of coming up blank on what could fill a book: Don\u2019t rack up credit card debt; if you have credit card debt, paying it off is high-priority, because so it\u2019s so *bleep!*-ing expensive.Don\u2019t necessarily rush to pay off a mortgage. (And don\u2019t rush into getting one; rent can be the better choice in many situation.)Don\u2019t be an idiot on education debt; think long and hard before racking it up.Don\u2019t go crazy on your car Beyond that, I\u2019m drawing a blank. \u201cBuild wealth with debt\u201d is usually advice that is given to businesses, as it\u2019s less-applicable to individuals. P.S. You probably know this, but you have until Tax Filing Day to send funds to an IRA, so in future years you don\u2019t have to stretch your checking account to the limit right at holiday-time to max out contributions.
