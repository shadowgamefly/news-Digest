{"content": "I agree that this can work, but it\u2019s applicable to a very few people. My wife has these things, and I think she is blessed. I am ok on the success front, not-so-much on the self-discipline and while you may not agree, it\u2019s not self-loathing, or other stuff. I am 55 and the suits I bought after college still fit. It takes no self-discipline for me to maintain a normal weight. If it did, I would be overweight. I have genes that make this possible. I also have genes that make me and my whole family susceptible to various forms of addiction. Please recognize that your experience (as with my wife\u2019s) is not typical, nor is it just a bad habit or lack of will. ", "child": "", "name": "1716_2", "parent": "1716", "title": ""}
