{"content": "I know you write from the heart but you are misleading cancer sufferers into believing they will not get better with modern medicine and that could cause someone to lose their life. I also had this same treatment but in Israel. I\u2019m from London, U.K. I also used natural healing alternatives including ones which are illegal, I also juiced and changed my diet excluding meat, dairy, bread and sugar.
