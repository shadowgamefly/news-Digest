{"content": "Klay\u2019s potential was evident from the moment he arrived in Oakland, but Mark Jackson\u2019s walk it up and dump it into the low post style stymied Klay\u2019s development. Jackson had one of the best 3 point shooters of all time posting up on the block and shooting turnaround 10 footers. The offense that Kerr and Alvin Gentry installed unleashed Klay (and Draymond), and Klay took it from there. Also, Klay is one of the hardest working players in the league. Even on the (rare) night when his shot is off, he never stops giving maximum effort on defense. He has improved as a rebounder and is an underrated passer off the dribble. Thank goodness Jerry West squashed the Thompson-Love trade. ", "child": "", "name": "106_7", "parent": "106", "title": ""}
