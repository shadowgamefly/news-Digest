{"content": "Here\u2019s my question about what happens \u201caround\u201d meetings. I\u2019ve been in lots of meetings in person that could have easily been handled remotely w/out travel. I\u2019ve done lots of asynchronous work online that doesn\u2019t need to be location based. But what I\u2019ve noticed in face to face meetings is stuff comes up before and after, often w/ just a couple people that you talk about things that you hadn\u2019t planned to discuss but \u201cSince I\u2019ve got you here\u00a0\u2026.\u201d Sure some of this would have risen to the level of scheduling another meeting if we were not physically together. But some may not have, or even if they did, the wait would have diminished quality of communication. For those who work this way on a regular basis, how have you dealt with this situation? Is it a problem, or just ignored? ", "child": "", "name": "238_8", "parent": "238", "title": ""}
