{"content": "I kept reading your article long after it was interesting, because you hijacked me, because of the 1% chance I was missing something. :P But seriously, this article is on point, but it fails to consider a few things. You have to limit choice, or people won\u2019t choose. People make an unconscious choice to maximize available choices, but then choosing between choices becomes an active choice. People are happier when choices are limited.The speed of life is what generates an expectation of immediate response. The idea is increased productivity.Tit-for-tat makes for good relationships. It gives people a reason to stay connected.I really just made a list because I wanted to highlight point #1. It makes it seem like the first statement is more important because it\u2019s part of a list. See what I did there?\u00a0:P So, obviously there are beneficial reasons why we respond to these traps. The solution may be more nuanced than you think. Giving people ultimate freedom actually hinders them more than anything else. What you need is a hybrid. For example, I get to select from 3 major categories. When I do, it responds with a suggestion, but also offers me to drill down to 3 subcategories. This allows me full range of choice, but doesn\u2019t hit me with all choices at once. It also gives me an out each time. I can stop at any point and choose to be satisfied with that level of accuracy. ", "child": "", "name": "2443_9", "parent": "2443", "title": ""}
