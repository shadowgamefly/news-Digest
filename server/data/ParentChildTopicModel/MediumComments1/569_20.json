{"content": "Your world view appears to be one of guilt and condemnation carefully clothed in the robes of self-righteousness. Your comments about the redemptive value of Jesus Christ\u2019s death and subsequent resurrection is in no way connected to the redemptive violence your column portrays. It is fallen man in his many attempts to be righteous and his inability to do so (Isaiah 64:6) that is the very reason that Christ died\u2026 We forget the holiness of God is perfect and in that perfection there cannot be the presence of sin. Jesus did not die to appease an angry Father, but rather to usher in before a loving God, those whom he loved, \u201cwhile we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d (Romans 5:8). There is evil in the world that must be held in check, and sometimes the sword of government must be wielded. There are those who have no earthly, much less heavenly idea about their evil fallen nature. However equating the prosecution of a war with the sinful violence of one person on another is a fallacy. There is a judgement for the sins of man\u2026 in this world, maybe. In the next, for sure. P.S. Just because I am not in agreement with your statements does not mean I am a hater. My disagreement is because I love you. ~ Mark 12:30\u201331; Lev. 19:9\u201318. This is why we as Christians should be about the great commission, because we have so great a commandment.
