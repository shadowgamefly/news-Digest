{"content": "Yowza. I was on the edge of my seat the whole story hoping this ended in some triumphant win for you where Michael was led away in handcuffs and you floated gracefully away to an amazing job at Facebook. But getting your apartment and cat back is a win, too! It\u2019s incredible how much grotesque antisocial (meaning \u201cdysfunctional and contrary to the needs of human society,\u201d not \u201cintroverted/shy\u201d) behavior there is in the startup world, and how otherwise functional people will rally around the scammers, liars, and pathological people to protect them from the natural consequences of their actions. It sometimes gets chalked up to personality disorders, mental illness, or (everyone\u2019s favorite thing to armchair-diagnose), \u201csociopaths.\u201d I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of it, but there\u2019s also some component where people who could perfectly well behave differently are simply choosing to behave in an evil, wrongful way for personal gain. It sounds like you ran into one of the latter category. Michael sounds like his only skill set is defrauding others, and he\u2019s cheerfully enough using it to his benefit. Thank goodness you got out without being lured into the circle of sycophants lending him money! ", "child": "", "name": "2441_18", "parent": "2441", "title": ""}
