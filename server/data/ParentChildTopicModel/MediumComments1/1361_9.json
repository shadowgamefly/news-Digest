{"content": "A somewhat simplistic canard that allows one to dislike conservatives? Hardly realistic given conservative religious people tend give more of their time and money to help the poor than, let us call them secular liberals. For many liberals the question is why doesn\u2019t the government do more? They think such thoughts makes them a good person. The myopia is ironic I know. I am always amazed at how easy it is to hold disdain for those who are not like you, as a young man I was very poor, As someone who is now more affluent I am more thankful for my position, and also more thoughtful as to how to give and to whom. I certainly do not hold those with different views as somehow morally inferior to be hated or even disdained. Perhaps if we judged others less and did more ourselves such stories would not sound so trite and hollow. ", "child": "", "name": "1361_9", "parent": "1361", "title": ""}
