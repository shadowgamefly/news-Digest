{"content": "Affordance is\u00a0what\u00a0an\u00a0object\u00a0is\u00a0capable\u00a0of. For example, a\u00a0door\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0opened, which is its affordance. A signifier communicates the affordance to the user. A door handle is a signifier. Affordance exists irrespective of the signifier. So what you are talking about here is a misleading signifier, not affordance. The article is very well written and is a great resource on the process of interaction design. Also the proposed design is so refreshing and functional. Hope HDFC adopts it \u263a ", "child": "", "name": "772_3", "parent": "772", "title": ""}
