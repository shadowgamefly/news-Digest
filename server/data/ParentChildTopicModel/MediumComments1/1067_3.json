{"content": "Come on. Do you think we are idiots? We read the manual on how to disrupt and shut down republican town halls written by soros funded political action groups. You didn\u2019t want to meet this representative. You wanted an opportunity to shut down, yell and make another public spectacle of democrats screaming and making a publicity stunt. Believe me it\u2019s better. People are not as stupid as you think. We don\u2019t all believe the filter bubble you listen to. We see who you are. You didn\u2019t win the election because none of your stunts and lies worked. Your thugs sent to disrupt trump rallies. We know about the 21 hate crimes you did and having Brazille give questions to Hillary. We know about the whole scheme to foster and create a climate of hate and fear. We get it. You are a moron compared to us. You have no clue how to change votes and people\u2019s minds. It won\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work. You\u2019re an incompetent fool like the rest of your democratic operatives. We know all your plans and ideas. You do realize that the republicans are one state away from getting enough state houses to have a constitutional congress and rewrite the constitution. Your efforts will enable the republicans to gain those additional seats. Thank you. ", "child": "", "name": "1067_3", "parent": "1067", "title": ""}
