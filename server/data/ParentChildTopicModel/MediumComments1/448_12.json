{"content": "Thanks for writing this Jake. Two points of disagreement: It\u2019s not a head fake to the family who had a 5 year old child handcuffed OR the Iraqi translator who has been planning to resettle his family here for 3+ years and whose life is now thrown into turmoil OR the university professor who is unsure whether she will be able to continue here research in the United States. Etc. Etc.Courage is contagious. Over the past two weeks we\u2019ve seen 100s of thousands of people (including myself) join protests who have not done so in over a decade (if ever). This leads to politicians feeling empowered to act on behalf of their mobilized constituents (as we saw at airports across the country), further empowering any judges or federal officials who may be on the fence. As a concrete example, I rode the BART with an off-duty police officer from South San Francisco who joined the SFO protest. In short, if any of the dangerous things you mention in your penultimate paragraph do come to pass, it will be important to have an active, energized, and vocal opposition. Waiting and hoping that these are just innocent mistakes will leave us playing catch up. ", "child": "", "name": "448_12", "parent": "448", "title": ""}
