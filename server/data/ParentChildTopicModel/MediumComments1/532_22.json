{"content": "These petty little men pull this stunt of hiding in the back room to show contempt for their female (both white and African American)counterparts reminds me of boys in junior high school more than likely sniggering while they sat. The whole scenario is basically grown women in the process of doing their jobs, being treated badly by juvenile men. I am glad Ms. Hortman did what she did. She called them on bad behavior that needed to be addressed. It may not change anything the next time as they will more than likely come up with some other way to act like young school boys. It would not matter what color they were they behaved badly. It absolutely amazes me that people like that get elected. They all need to grow up and act like adults which admittedly will be difficult for them. ", "child": "", "name": "532_22", "parent": "532", "title": ""}
