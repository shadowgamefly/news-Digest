{"content": "I have an issue with the people screaming at the top of their lungs that the Thunder supporting cast is trash that pales in comparison to that of the Rockets. The Thunder are severely lacking in the spot-up shooting area, but they have a good mix of talent ranging from a defensive stopper in Roberson to quality backup bigs like Kanter and Gibson (as a Celtics fan, I hurt a little on the inside knowing how well Gibson and McDermott would have fit with this team). But realistically, Morey took a chance on Harden running the show, he doubled down on shooting with guys like Gordon and Anderson, and tripled down with the D\u2019Antoni hire. They have their old glue guys like Beverley and Ariza, and they traded for Lou Williams. Outside of that. they have some athletic bigs and the ghost of Nene. Last time I checked, Eric Gordon was a forgotten man and now he\u2019s the second best player on a 54-win team. For everything said and written about Westbrook\u2019s unbelievable season, I think more credit is owed to Harden and the collective team effort seen from Houston this season.
