{"content": "Thanks for your comment\u200a\u2014\u200agreat great point. I actually went back and forth on this. I held off on recommending going that route for a couple of reasons: I\u2019ve frequently seen early teams implement event tracking so poorly that the data was largely unusable. It\u2019s non-trivial to implement event tracking correctly, especially in environments with multiple domains, complex user identification use cases (think OAuth), or websites linking to apps and wanting to stitch user identities together.I really think that Snowplow is the best solution here for companies that anticipate scaling, simply because Segment and Heap will create lock-in in the early stages of a business and then massively ratchet up costs as volume increases. With Snowplow, because it is open source, this is not a concern. While Snowplow is more challenging to implement, I think its advantages for a growing company are worth the wait. All that said, this is not at all cut and dry and just represents my own experiences. You\u2019re pointing out an area that deserves careful consideration for every business.
