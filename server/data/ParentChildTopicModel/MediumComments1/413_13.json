{"content": "\u201c[C]ondemning humanity to extinction\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe just a little extreme. I share some of your sentiments, but this depiction is simplistic and sometimes hyperbolic. Unfortunately the arguments come across like rehearsed talking points. Cutting and running doesn\u2019t help very much either. Perhaps your piece was meant to be purely cathartic and if so I hope it helped. And unless you\u2019re leaving Earth or a modern lifestyle, presumably you\u2019ll still be consuming electricity etc. It would be great to see a follow on post describing how your move has benefitted the planet.
