{"content": "In the past, we\u2019ve typically said that if these worlds are approximately the size of Earth and receiving approximately as much energy-per-square-meter as Earth, these are likely Earth-like worlds. But this was an assumption that we made prior to having enough data to draw a conclusion. While NASA\u2019s Kepler mission brought us lots of information about a planet\u2019s radius and orbital parameters, it\u2019s impossible to tell whether a world is gassy like Uranus (or Neptune) or rocky like Earth without also measuring its mass. But thanks to follow-up observations of their pull on their parent star, we\u2019ve obtained the mass for hundreds of these worlds. And the conclusion they point to is damning.", "child": "", "name": "2476_1", "parent": "2476", "title": ""}
