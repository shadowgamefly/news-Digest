{"content": "McClintock is trash. Can\u2019t believe your District voted him him. I get the zero enthusiasm for GOP lite Clinton. But local races matter too.

It\u2019s bad for pocketbook for all of you who live there, you too Republicans. ", "child": "", "name": "483_5", "parent": "483", "title": ""}
