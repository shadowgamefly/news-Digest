{"content": "Often it seems that white creators can\u2019t be trusted to tell this truth. Whiteness (and patriarchy) affects the lens through which white male filmmakers, writers, directors, etc. perceive white women. The impulse to protect white women \u2014 a certain kind, usually: those of us who uphold the feminine values deemed worthy of protection \u2014 is strong. This results in the depiction of nonracist versions of white female characters but also sexist ones. Intersections matter. But of course, white women writers, directors, etc. do something of the same: we often imagine ourselves as the friend and \u201cnatural ally\u201d to people of color, specifically women of color, rallying under the banner of \u201cwe\u2019re all women\u201d which always ignores intersections of privilege and oppression. This results in stories featuring white heroines with a Black sidekick, or the boss with a Latina assistant, to whom she is very kind and generous and who of course adores her as the good, kind, moral, non-racist white woman the white writer imagines herself to be.", "child": "", "name": "536_1", "parent": "536", "title": ""}
