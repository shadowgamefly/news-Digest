{"content": "Looking for a culture fit sounds like a euphemism for discriminatory practices. It usually means that outstanding applicants\u200a\u2014\u200aand maybe even the best applicants get rejected simply because they\u2019re the wrong race, age or gender, etc. It would be nice if more companies were mature enough to look past culture fit and at culture contribution instead.
