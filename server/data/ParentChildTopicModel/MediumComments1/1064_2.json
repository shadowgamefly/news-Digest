{"content": "The \u201cState\u2019s Rights\u201d movement is a \u201cReligious Conservative / Corporate State\u201d, present day construct. States Rights for the \u201cReligious Conservative\u201d effort is an attempt to force reproductive rights, as well as other lifestyle issues to the state level. The, \u201cCorporate State\u201d effort is all about control and maximizing profits while limiting environmental and employee regulation. Personally I see this as new confederate activity. States Rights would have our Federal Government minimized and replaced by potentially fifty sets of laws and regulations. Republican efforts in gerrymandering, propaganda, fear, misinformation, illegal voting laws, and the church pulpit have been used effectively. The \u201cReligious Conservative / Corporate State\u201d prize is in the White House. I find it interesting that once again economic and religious dogma and corporate profiteering has unleashed a confederate effort upon our Union. Commentary related to states succession from the Union have increased in frequency. The cost of the \u201cReligious Conservative / Corporate State\u201d attack has already been substantial. The \u201cReligious Conservative / Corporate State\u201d, has chosen a path to engage and vilify the Judicial Branches of government. Of course political hypocrisy is rampant in this environment. Our, United States is the Union that has enable what is good in 0ur nation. Greek slave Aesop, of \u201cAesop\u2019s Fables\u201d seems to be the source of the concept of, \u201cUnited we live, divided we fall\u201d. As Aesop\u2019s fable was told, \u201cMy sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this bundle, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.\u201d ", "child": "", "name": "1064_2", "parent": "1064", "title": ""}
