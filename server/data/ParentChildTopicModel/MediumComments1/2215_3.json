The fact that we don\u2019t know how exposed our stories are has disturbed me for a while, because it severely limits our ability to conduct a statistical analysis. Just knowing how many people click on the story and how many read all the way through it isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve also noticed that if I indulge in a particular author or subject, then the algorithm shifts for me for a few days. It looks like a spiderweb to me.

But there seems to have been a slight revamp of the algorithm a month ago or so. ", "child": "", "name": "2215_3", "parent": "2215", "title": ""}
