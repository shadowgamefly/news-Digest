{"content": "Hi Lena. Have you heard about Black Lives Matter? I have seen a lot of that in this place. Have you thought about\u2026those movements and raising voices on the rights of Black people could be a light contribution to segregation? What you think is your right\u2026is in fact, proving a separating force from other people and races\u2026 I wonder why, for example, there are universities for black people, neighborhoods, and even churches with only black people congregating. Why? Would it be that black people are contributing to segregation direct or indirectly? Keep doing what you do best\u2026play as a master those music instruments, keep playing the best those sports where black people are the only winners and give the glory to your country. But the most important: Keep praising the Lord the way Black people use to do\u2026with joy and a pure heart\u2026and do not segregate gathering with only black people. We all have two eyes, one mouth, two ears\u2026two hands\u2026we only differ in our skin color that\u2026does not really matter. Saludos!!!
