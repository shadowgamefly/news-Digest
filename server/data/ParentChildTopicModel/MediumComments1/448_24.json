{"content": "Thats a good fucking article Jake. Goddamn\u2026Realize this my friends. The Protests are good. But don\u2019t let that be the end of it..you need to be vigilant in your every move and thought these days. Don\u2019t think because we protest we have \u2018done our part\u2019 and we can pat ourselves on the back. Even if we have a few victories. This all plays directly into social engineering. There are people that are paid lots of money to study us and figure us out. While we toil away at our shit ass jobs every day to squelch together a living. They have been thinking ten..twenty..thirty chess moves ahead of society. They know the action/reaction game very well and often use our protests and emotions against us. We have to be smart as fuck. Sharp as tacks in these dire times. We could miss a beat and lose everything. Stay alert and pay attention. Don\u2019t believe the rhetoric..even if it feels good. Analyze\u2026and we will survive.
