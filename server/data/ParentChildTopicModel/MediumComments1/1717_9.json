{"content": "\u201cDieting to lose weight\u201d is a losing endeavour. Change the way you behave and eat to naturally weigh about what you plan to weight. In 2007, I mostly ditched some carbs entirely from my diet and started doing 90 minutes of sport 6 days a week and lost 12 kg in 3 months. As long as I stick to that regimen, my weight remains stable. The point is to stick to the simplest possible rule to keep excuses at bay. Saying \u201cno more biscuits and no more pizza\u201d is pretty easy to stick to. Choose some easy rules that you can stick to on the long run. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t eat pizza once in a while, but your general rule must be \u201cno pizza\u201d (or no bread, no pasta, no rice, no soda, whatever you eat regularly and is packed with calories). Same for sports. Two or three time a week isn\u2019t easy enough to me; too often I\u2019d procrastinate into \u201cI\u2019m late this morning so I\u2019ll do it tomorrow instead\u201d. 6 days a week (every day but sunday for me) means that every day I have to do my routine of abs, push-ups, etc. and a 5\u201310 km run or 20 km cycling. No excuse, even if it rains, freezes, snows, whatever. Not having to think about it is key for me. ", "child": "", "name": "1717_9", "parent": "1717", "title": ""}
