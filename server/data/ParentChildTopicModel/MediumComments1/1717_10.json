{"content": "The way to manage this isn\u2019t through a diet and exercise program\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t solve this with a temporary solution and like you have already noticed\u200a\u2014\u200aas soon as you stop following your temporary solution, the weight comes back. There are programs out there for people who want to make these small changes\u200a\u2014\u200athey are not found under diet or exercise sections though. They\u2019re found under success and self-discipline. You have to permanently make changes to your lifestyle\u200a\u2014 I\u2019m the same size as I was in college. I\u2019ve had a baby, and I\u2019ve had stress and other factors over my life where I gained weight\u200a\u2014\u200abut because of the habits I\u2019ve maintained throughout my life like: exercise everyday\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it\u2019s only 20 minutes, even if I\u2019m feeling a little under the weather and can only manage a short walk around the block, skip bacon and processed foods, don\u2019t eat dessert every day, make sure I get a good breakfast and fill my plates with more veggies than fruit or meat, etc. I live a healthy, active lifestyle and it\u2019s not easy but these are habits I\u2019ve decided to keep forever and that\u2019s the mindset necessary to maintain your health throughout life. It\u2019s always funny to me how people realize they have to shower every day and brush their teeth every day if they don\u2019t want to smell bad or have rotten teeth, but when it comes to food and exercise\u200a\u2014\u200athey have no trouble skipping days of being healthy and then act like going on a diet once a year is going to somehow prevent health problems in the future. I\u2019m pretty sure I couldn\u2019t expect a good set of teeth if I only brushed for 3 months out of the year. ", "child": "", "name": "1717_10", "parent": "1717", "title": ""}
