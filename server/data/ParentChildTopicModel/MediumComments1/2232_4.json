{"content": "A whole lotta research went into this. Well done. That said the \u201cindie film\u201d is a term used by people that talk about films not done by the studio systems. I personally don\u2019t consider Sundance or SXSW or Tribeca or Toronto to be \u201cindie film\u201d. They are all corporate festivals. Look at their sponsors from the likes of Chase and Visa. Sundance is a who you know \u201cfestival\u201d to even get accepted not just about your content. Low budget and I mean very low budget films are getting lost on these two platforms. Not a month goes by where I don\u2019t get a social media post from one of my friends asking me to watch their film on one of these platforms. That said, the TV show market is where it is at not indie film IMO. If you have actors/actresses like Jude Law, Kevin Spacey, Nicole Kidman, Martin Sheen, Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and the list goes on, doing TV series, that\u2019s where the shift is going. Moreover, pretty soon Marvel will make everyone a superhero and that will kill the tentpole movies. Finally, Hollywood has ALWAYS had a hard time adapting to change in technology. Napster gave way to the ability to download a song a time. It took a long time for them to adapt to that and Apple forced Hollywood\u2019s hand. If we waited for Hollywood and their antiquated ways to get up to speed, we may not have it. There will be a pivot in this industry in how movies are consumed and that will be good for the filmmaker and the audience. It will become a more targeted approach for true independent filmmakers who are mortgaging their financial futures to be creatives. We will get our next Tarantino. Humans have an amazing ability to adapt to change it just Hollywood that is slow to catch up. ", "child": "", "name": "2232_4", "parent": "2232", "title": ""}
