{"content": "The true\u00a0antidote The only antidote to fake news is to stop reading all news! I recommend forgetting about world affairs and turning our attention to local issues in our own respective towns and areas. We can NOT change anything about the idiots playing games at the top, but we can have an immediate effect on the direction of our own community. Imagine if we all just stopped listening! It\u2019s like walking away from someone who\u2019s insulting you. Stop taking it. Turn away from world news and towards your street! Give your energy to local issues that matter to you and make your street a better place. ", "child": "", "name": "270_13", "parent": "270", "title": ""}
