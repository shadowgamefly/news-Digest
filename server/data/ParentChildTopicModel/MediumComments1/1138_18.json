{"content": "This hits home for me. I am a few years into my second marriage; my first spouse had a lot in common with yours, but I was fortunate enough to escape mostly unscathed. My current spouse is good with money, I trust him, and I don\u2019t anticipate us breaking up\u200a\u2014\u200abut I keep a lot of things separate just in case. But it\u2019s not a secret, which is key. It took some uncomfortable talks, but basically we\u2019ve come to a good place where we have some joint stuff (including a house\u2026 that was a big step) and some separate stuff, but at least a few times a year we check in and talk honestly about how all our finances are doing, including the separate stuff. We don\u2019t tell each other how to manage the separate stuff, but we do report back to each other on it and talk about our goals. Not every person would be willing to work with my fears on this\u200a\u2014\u200abut then again, not every person would be a good partner for me. I\u2019ve been thinking more about the separate stuff lately as my parents approach retirement. My mom is well-paid and smart with money, and has accumulated assets that will allow her to retire comfortably. She and her spouse have a similar arrangement to me and my spouse\u200a\u2014\u200aa few joint things but most savings, etc., are separate, including retirement. Her spouse is also well-paid and not bad with money, but he hasn\u2019t saved as much as she has (in part due to his past divorce and having more kids, I am sure\u200a\u2014\u200ano judgment here) and the math for his retirement is a little less certain. He\u2019s not unable to retire, but he has the possibility of outliving his savings, which my mom really doesn\u2019t (barring something incredibly unexpected), even though he\u2019s a decade older. His timeline and savings plans for retirement affect hers, even though they\u2019ve kept the money separate \u2014their ability to pay for future joint expenses obviously hinges upon them both having money for the rest of their lives. I don\u2019t try to manage my spouse\u2019s savings because he does a perfectly fine job of handling the day-to-day and always seems to be putting something away, but because he doesn\u2019t earn as much as I do, he doesn\u2019t put as much into retirement, either. I wonder if we might end up in a similar situation, where my best-laid plans don\u2019t align with his despite the arrangement working well on a day-to-day basis while we\u2019re working.
