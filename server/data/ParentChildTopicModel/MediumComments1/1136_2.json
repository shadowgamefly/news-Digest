{"content": "My student loan debt did feel really crippling. Even when I had the means to start paying the debt back, which luckily started right after college since I was lucky enough to find a job right away, even just the idea of it was overwhelming. Like I said in my article, I had a \u201csavings\u201d account, but I knew that as long as I had debt, that money was never really mine. To help curb the feelings of helplessness I had, though, I just really tried to put any extra money towards my loans to get them out of the way. That meant keeping my personal expenses low and trying to always pay off more than my monthly payment. The biggest thing, regardless of your situation, is just to do what you can. Even the fact that you are already thinking about paying your loans back means that you\u2019ll do what you can\u200a\u2014\u200ayou just have to try to stay on top of it.
