{"content": "Niner fans HATE Jed York. Really loathe him. His last name is often used as a synonym for various expletives on 49ers blogs. Mainly they hate him for firing Jim Harbaugh, but there\u2019s also the out of touch rich a-hole type who inherited a football team persona he\u2019s cultivated. But even with firing Jim Harbaugh and hiring Jim Tomsula I think the stadium is his most damning mistake. They might be able to hire another good coach, but they\u2019re stuck with that stadium. It\u2019s a total botch job, and everyone involved: Santa Clara, Niner Fans, and the Niners\u2026is stuck with it for a long time. It\u2019s like bad plastic surgery. It\u2019s horrible, it can\u2019t be fixed, and it\u2019s just sad. ", "child": "", "name": "1644_10", "parent": "1644", "title": ""}
