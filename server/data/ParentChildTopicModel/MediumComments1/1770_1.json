We destroyed each other\u2019s dreams.\u201d \u2015 Kate Chisman Movements that primarily define themselves in opposition to an idea and are otherwise broadly inclusive can definitely have difficulties. A good case to study would be what happened to the Atheist movement over the last few years. The movement was primarily opposed to irrational beliefs (young earth creationism, anti-evolution, anti-vaxxers, flood literalism, flat earthers, scientologists, religious hate and terrorist groups and various other bits of new age woo, snakeoil) being used to push irrational policies in government (especially schools) and to defraud the uneducated, seniors, disabled and sick. The cracks began around the same time and was related to Gamergate but there were Atheist-specific issues (accusations of rape, attempted rape, menacing behavior and proposals for convention codes of conduct) as well. Some influential voices on YouTube sided with histrionic SJWs or MRAs. Many \u201cmoderates\u201d quickly got tired of the public infighting or trying to defend less extreme comments that were being lumped in and attacked right along with the more extreme and less rational voices. It seems nearly everyone has a hot-button issue that brings out their irrational side\u200a\u2014\u200aeven in a movement that mostly prides itself on rationalism and evidence. Infighting in the LGBT community may be another good example but I\u2019m not acquainted well enough with the details to comment even half-way intelligently.
