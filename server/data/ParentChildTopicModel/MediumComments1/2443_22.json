{"content": "Great article. As a product designer, these are definitely points to chew on. I wonder if you\u2019ve thought about how some of these hijacks are put in place as a trade off for not having to pay for a particular service. Take hijack #8 for example: if you want a free product, you need to get through everything else the company wants you to get through before getting to what you want. If you\u2019re willing to pay, products might let you skip all that and get to what you want straight away. Or take hijack #1: paid enterprise software often gives clients the agency to pick what they want their choices to be in exchange for a large invoice. Building free software, however, might necessitate restricting the menu of choices to a set menu to gain economies of scale. Of course, plenty of these hijacks exist even in paid software, so it\u2019s not like users are given the option to completely do away with them in exchange for money. But perhaps the price the product companies would command to completely do away with all these hijacks might be something no customer is willing to pay, so they settle and offer to do away with some of these hijacks for a more palatable price\u2026 ", "child": "", "name": "2443_22", "parent": "2443", "title": ""}
