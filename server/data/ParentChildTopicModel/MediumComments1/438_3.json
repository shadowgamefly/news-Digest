{"content": "The poll results, like so many similar polls, show that the vast majority of xenophobes are in the Republican Party. The rest of us see the folly (and expensive folly, at that) of attempting to build an impenetrable wall the length of the entire border, especially when a good portion of that border is a river, and that to fund the wall, Trump wants to cut back on Coast Guard protection of our coastline (any guesses as to what the path of least resistance into our country will be then?).

Only they didn\u2019t employ any critical thinking skills at the time\u200a\u2014\u200aotherwise they would have known that such a wall would be impossible to build without gaps, and they would have known it would have done little (if anything) to actually halt illegal immigration from the south.
