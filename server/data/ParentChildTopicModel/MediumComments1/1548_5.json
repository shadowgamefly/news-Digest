{"content": "I have been following the fracking controversy\u200a\u2014\u200anot that diligently, I confess\u200a\u2014\u200aand so far have felt that the evidence is too weak to justify stronger regulatory action. This is largely because the amount of data available has been insufficient. So far, most of the arguments in favor of greater regulatory restrictions have been precautionary in nature: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that fracking is contaminating water, but it is possible that it might.\u201d This article continues that precautionary approach. It does not provide solid evidence of actual contamination; instead, it demonstrates that the state of Oklahoma has failed to implement prudent safeguards against the possibility of contamination. The precautionary principle is applicable because, once a water table is contaminated, it is impossible to clean it up. The best that can be done is to provide all users with equipment to clean their well water as it is used. Such equipment can be very expensive. I would like to see more actual data on well contamination before endorsing stricter regulatory restrictions on fracking practices. ", "child": "", "name": "1548_5", "parent": "1548", "title": ""}
