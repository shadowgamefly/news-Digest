{"content": "Dan, I disagree that Redux shouldn\u2019t be the first choice for people learning React. It *may* sometimes not be the right choice, but it certainly can be, as I experienced. As a very new programmer, I struggled a lot with spaghetti code, unintended side effects, architecture that got confusing as it grew. With React + immutable + pure programming, all of which Redux glues together well. I had one object to look at to understand application state, mutations were easy to understand and follow, accidental side effects were rare. It made my application very easy to reason about, because it was very clear what happens, where data flows to, what gets updated. There were no magical behind the scenes behaviours that I had to read the documentation on and then trust or work around. I don\u2019t think my applications will scale the way I want them to with Redux. I will have to refactor them to simplify some of the patterns and sources of friction that are emerging. But I really like that I get to do that on my terms, not the framework\u2019s. ", "child": "", "name": "1501_8", "parent": "1501", "title": ""}
