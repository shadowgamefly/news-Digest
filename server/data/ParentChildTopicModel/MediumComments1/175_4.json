{"content": "We got our taxes back from our accountant a few weeks ago and I went ahead and paid what we owed right away because I a) didn\u2019t want the paperwork sitting around my house and b) didn\u2019t want to forget about it. I was super disappointed because our accountant way underestimated my estimated taxes for 2016, even though our income situation didn\u2019t change that much. So I ended up owing about $6000 federal/state/city taxes, and my only consolation is that I always save 30% of every check in my business accounts so I already had the money set aside there.
