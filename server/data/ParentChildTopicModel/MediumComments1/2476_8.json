{"content": "I thought the \u201c1.2 Earth radius 2 times Earth mass\u201d wasn\u2019t a hard-and-fast boundary. It\u2019s just that below that, planets never hold on to any meaningful hydrogen atmosphere, and above it they become increasingly likely to do so depending on the metallicity of the star (up to around 1.5 times Earth radius and 5\u20136 times Earth mass, beyond which they\u2019re virtually always Sub-Neptunes). That graph is confusing, but it looks like there are still a number of planets beyond the boundary on the same trend line as that below it.
