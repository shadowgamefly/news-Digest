{"content": "First of all, I didn\u2019t know if full screen ads are thrusted into Instagram stories. Certainly, as many others I wake up to my Instagram Engineering and Medium profiles. Yet the whole day continues to linger around these two moreish apps\u00a0. I wasn\u2019t quiet happy with the stories section even when snapchat kicked it off first. May be I hated it as snapchat doesn\u2019t seem to have a calculated UI that amuses its users. Perhaps, then adaption spree began. For which I have extreme enmity, plainly. I would prefer to see products being built with their own innovation than the cheap style of copying the existing model right away with no tiddly shame. I HATE IT.
