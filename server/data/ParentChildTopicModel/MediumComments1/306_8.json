{"content": " Allan, I do admit I did not pray for you.. I had a lot to ask forgiveness for, and the service was not long enough. In fact as the pastor started to preach I thought the service would come to an end before all my sins could be passed over. I decided that my fingers were saying so much more than I allow my mouth to express, and if it was the end I\u2019d better start with me. Quite selfish, but in safety we must take care of self first. No worries. If president Nukeass does not press the button before Easter Sunday, I will start praying for others and I will be sure to add your name. Then, I\u2019ll resume my list of things I have sinned about in my thoughts, was only working on the deeds today. Yes, I\u2019m a sinner and I do sin a lot in my thoughts\u200a\u2014\u200aI do covet kissing a sexy bloke, but whoever comes to mind is probably a TV star married, engaged or not available, so I\u2019m asking in advance for forgiveness as I watch television presently. Let\u2019s not forget all the men I\u2019ve had a meal with, when their wives were not present\u00a0; never mind I may not have even entertained illicit thoughts because of their lack of sex appeal. Sorry Allan, I won\u2019t be in New York anytime soon, but you can come visit my hut on the cool Caribbean shores after president Dumbassnuke presses the trigger. I\u2019m trying to see if I can build a bunker from banana leaves today, hope it will save me... I\u2019m trying out that green outfit to blend into the background! Good Friday Blessings All!
