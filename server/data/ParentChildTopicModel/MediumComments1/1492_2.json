{"content": "@BorisMann There is no mention in the docs for ReactXP to support other desktop environments, the docs clearly say: > Other platforms such as Windows 7 & 8, MacOS, and Linux can be targeted using a web wrapper solution like Electron. ReactXP is built on top of React and React Native, neither of which are natively supporting desktop, so I don\u2019t see ReactXP extending into that space anytime soon. You\u2019re, of course, better off using React + Electron for multi-platform desktop support since ReactXP doesn\u2019t even support Windows 10 / UWP yet; so your options would be to wait (if you\u2019re only interested in Windows 10 support), or use Electron. I also don\u2019t see how you\u2019d use React Native with Electron. ", "child": "", "name": "1492_2", "parent": "1492", "title": ""}
