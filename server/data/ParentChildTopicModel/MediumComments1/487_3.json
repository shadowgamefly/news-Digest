{"content": "My 33-year-old daughter is like many of you; she knows she doesn\u2019t want children. I would have been fine if I had never had a child, but I got pregnant unexpectedly at the age of 36, after giving up on it for nearly seven years. I love my daughter, and I am glad I have her in my life, but I see absolutely no reason for her to have a child if she doesn\u2019t want one. Live and let live is my motto.
