{"content": "I\u2019m not writing to tell you how right you are. I don\u2019t think that matters. In this hateful climate in America, I was glad to read your piece, not posted as NEWS, but offered as your intelligent observations on the ramifications of a comment. AND I\u2019m grateful for your restraint from reflecting on Mr. Pence\u2019s moral aptitude in your list of ramifications, which I applaud even more. Not because I\u2019m conservative or even his supporter, but because everyone is born with the right to always be treated with the respect you\u2019ve shown him. You didn\u2019t rant or name-call. I respect your restraint, and your respect of Mike Pence, even as your observations were that his beliefs in this area might be backward and even problematic if others behaved the same. THIS is what we learn from, not the hateful climate of the fake news arena. We learn things, any things, when we feel safe and respected. Thankx for giving that to us all! This is an opinion piece that adheres to all the high standards of true journalism, even though you don\u2019t claim it as news reporting. I believe, as you do apparently, that anything written and distributed to the public MUST adhere to true journalistic standards. ", "child": "", "name": "486_8", "parent": "486", "title": ""}
