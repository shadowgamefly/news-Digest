{"content": "This is a common theme in literature\u200a\u2014\u200aa lot of people (myself included!) thrive on writing about writing, even before they\u2019ve completed a major, established piece. It\u2019s supposedly an overused trope, that of a writer striving (and failing) and teaching others\u00a0\u2026 And yet! On at other end, there\u2019s a hunger for reading about writers struggling, about writers writing, and about real and fictional books in all their different guises (being written, unwritten, intertwined, etc). Why? Any idea of what drives this self-referential literary craze? Does writing about writing give the beginner a way of working out his or her issues, of gaining self-confidence? What about the readers: we read because we can relate to the issues? Maybe it\u2019s something deeper that stirs at the point where the human condition meets written language. That\u2019d be nice. More depths to plumb, more depths to plunder, never at a loss for new material. ", "child": "", "name": "1405_19", "parent": "1405", "title": ""}
