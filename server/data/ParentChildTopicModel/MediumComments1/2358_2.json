{"content": "Ravi Shankar Rajan\u200a\u2014\u200aThat\u2019s a great point. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s important for the team to have confidence that the outcome will be positive. I agree that it\u2019s risky for the leader to show vulnerability during a storm, but I don\u2019t think we should rule it out.
