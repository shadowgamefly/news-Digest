{"content": "You should be careful with this kind of advice. I liked reading your story and it\u2019s nice to know that you also healed without resorting to medication. However there are many different people out there and many need medication and (or) therapy. It is dangerous to say that everyone can heal the same way that you did. Anxiety disorders are a wide spectrum of disorders that can get worse if untreated! The kind of advice you give here makes people think that a anxiety is all the same and b they can power through (or worse, look on the Internet for advice), some people will manage (because it wasn\u2019t that severe in the fist place) but those who won\u2019t will end up in worst than they were before. People, if you have panic attacks, or feel anxious in a daily basis, go to a licensed psychiatrist. If you don\u2019t want medication talk to him about this and make an informed decision with him.
