{"content": "We just \u201ccelebrated\u201d Cesar Chavez Day. Whoopie! But wait! Isn\u2019t he the guy who called illegal immigrants, \u201cWetbacks?\u201d And fiercely defended the need to keep illegal immigrants OUT of the US? I kinda like the real Cesar Chavez. The one that is paraded about in schools and the liberal media? Eh, not so much. He was there, on the ground, seeing what illegal immigration does to our economy. Perhaps we should listen to him, as we celebrate his memory. ", "child": "", "name": "434_4", "parent": "434", "title": ""}
