{"content": "This is a legitimate question that I have about this. I disagree (strongly) politically with most of the sports writers I follow on twitter and social media. After 8 years of not paying attention to a single thing Barack Obama did besides doing interviews they found amusing, they\u2019ve now made it their mission to become political activists. What am I supposed to do? Legitimately, what am I supposed to do? It actively annoys me to read their political takes, but I value and trust their analysis of football, baseball, basketball, whatever. Should I really unfollow them to avoid being annoyed by their overly simplistic and in my view, flat out wrong political ideology? Or do I just grit my teeth and suffer through it just to get sports coverage? I\u2019ve never once said \u201cstick to sports\u201d, but I just wonder how they\u2019d feel if the roles were reversed and they had to listen to my political ideology to get to the stuff they actually care about. The old jokes about relatives posting political stuff on Facebook aren\u2019t even relevant anymore, sportswriters are the new relatives. But it\u2019s a one-way conversation. These writers have hundreds of thousands of followers, they\u2019re not going to engage on twitter with people who have counterarguments to their points. I\u2019m not even saying that they should, I just think that\u2019s part of the frustration for people like me, I don\u2019t want to argue politics on social media, I don\u2019t want to see political arguments on twitter, but it\u2019s more frustrating to just see one political ideology presented as fact without any of the other side. I guess the upside to this is that I guess writers are actually paying attention now? I guess? Or maybe the upside is that I\u2019m following national policy geniuses marauding as sportswriters? I had no idea. ", "child": "", "name": "266_4", "parent": "266", "title": ""}
