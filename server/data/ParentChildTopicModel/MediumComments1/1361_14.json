{"content": "Anastasia, I came upon your piece through a friend on Facebook, and it was the first thing I read this morning while sitting on my porch having coffee. It rocked me to the core. Please know how important your words are to those of us who did not grow up as the working poor. I grew up in a white middle class family in East Texas, and some summers, I thought we were poor. My mom would tell us what was left in her checking account (sometimes it wasn\u2019t much at all), and that we might not be able to do the things we wanted to do. Maybe we didn\u2019t go out to eat. Maybe we had breakfast for dinner. Maybe we didn\u2019t go to the water park with our friends. For my family, a financial burden was a mere inconvenience. We were never hungry. I don\u2019t have the adequate words to thank you for writing this piece. As a result, I am going to take action. First, in the form of sharing your words. Secondly, I am going to gather moms with teen kids in Austin and read this with them. Then, we will discuss next steps. It will be more than giving coats. Your words will have a ripple effect if we stop to listen and take action. Thank you. ", "child": "", "name": "1361_14", "parent": "1361", "title": ""}
