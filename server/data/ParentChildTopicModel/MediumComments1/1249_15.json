{"content": "Been feeling this way all week, couldn\u2019t put it into words, aren\u2019t we all a little of this absurd human? \u201cAn absurd human knows about his mortality and yet doesn\u2019t accept it, knows about the limitation of his reasoning, yet still holds it dear, feels the pleasure and pain of his experiences and yet tries to take in as many as possible.\u201d How do we break into the Permanent rebellion state and function in today\u2019s society which is narrated so heavily with eternal plans? Does denying our eternal plans give us no goals to work towards? Should the eternal goal\u2019s \u201cinevitable shatter\u201d push us to look at life with steady, uncertain reason and make \u201chypothetical goals\u201d that may not reach fruition? This feels like doom for someone suffering with depression. Just some thoughts. LOVED this article and the well-placed GIFS. ", "child": "", "name": "1249_15", "parent": "1249", "title": ""}
