If it is worthwhile programming then get private funding. This is ignoring the fact that using a 7 year old as a political prop is distasteful. Whoever brought the child should be called out and shamed. These are grownup decisions that have to be made. We don\u2019t need the input of 7 year olds that you can\u2019t really respond to because you don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. It is those types of shenanigans which makes politicians reluctant to hold those kinds of meetings. Too many want to turn a meeting into staged political theatre.
