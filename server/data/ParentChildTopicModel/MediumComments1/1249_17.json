{"content": "I love this article. So many messages in there and each time I read it, I found new ones. One that stood out is that we live in a society that is so focused on \u2018future\u2019: ensuring that we study hard and choose the right subjects so that we can define our future in 10 years time, working non stop and saving up so that one day in the future we can have a really nice time somewhere other than where we live. I could go on. The point is that we are missing the fact that we are alive now. We need to find joy in life now, and make the most of now. We need to live in the now. Not only fantasising about the future. Because life is for living! Thank you for this, really insightful! ", "child": "", "name": "1249_17", "parent": "1249", "title": ""}
