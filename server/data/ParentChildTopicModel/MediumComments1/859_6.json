{"content": "Cristian Randieri, Phd \u2013 Excellent topic and you did a great job of articulating some complex concepts in a fairly simple way! To expand upon your final thoughts above, machine learning is powerful, but has its limits. And those precise limits, I believe, are where biomarkers will elevate machine learning to its most potent variation yet, as you alluded-to in your closing remarks (\u201cIn other words other networks (social and biochemical) rely on the same principle.\u201d)\u00a0. Once virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality devices become more commonplace (which will happen very, very soon), and those devices are paired with feedback data from other wearables, facial + gaze recognition will be taken to a whole new level where pupil-dilation, facial micro-expressions and heart-rate will be combined to determine various neuro-chemical biomarkers/states, such as dopamine and adrenaline release, and those are some of the most powerful/useful data-points out there. And that\u2019s where machine learning begins to both deeply excite and overwhelmingly terrify me, depending on who\u2019s wielding the tools.
