{"content": "CBS COULD have opted not to show the outing\u2026 but then, Probst took that matter into his own hands the night of. As soon as he declared that a vote was unnecessary, that was that. Now the editors had no choice, for the sake of coherent storytelling, but to explain why a boot that looked about as predictable as dozens, maybe hundreds of others over the course of the show\u2019s history had turned into a boot that was so predictable that Probst didn\u2019t even want to go through the motions. Something like that only can be explained by extraordinary circumstances. Such as a non-consensual outing. If he doesn\u2019t hold the vote, and they don\u2019t explain why, then there\u2019s a big postshow hunt to find out why the vote wasn\u2019t held\u2026 and if anyone finds the answer, there\u2019s still the outing, and now it\u2019s in the form of an uncontrolled bombshell as opposed to the controlled bomb-squad detonation we got here. The best solution would have been to hold the vote and go through the motions and play it off as any other free boot. Varner was gone anyway; nobody would have dug too much into it.
