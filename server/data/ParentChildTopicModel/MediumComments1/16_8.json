{"content": "I want to see a CFO bump down to a designer\u2019s salary and see if they still want to call themselves a \u201cdesigner\u201d after that. As a couple of people above have already commented, making design decisions does not make you a designer. Makes you a well-intentioned and valuable collaborator (assuming you\u2019re not an asshole to the design team) but not a designer. When designers make copy edits, does that make us copy writers or editors? No. When we estimate budgets, does that make us financial experts? No. We didn\u2019t study or train for these things, and that\u2019s ok. The CFO and copy editor didn\u2019t train in design, and that\u2019s ok too. A successful team can\u2019t have everyone calling themselves the same thing. A successful team is an amalgamation of people with different skills who know their own strengths and weaknesses. On a successful team, my weakness is someone else\u2019s strength and vice versa. And that\u2019s ok. More than ok. ", "child": "", "name": "16_8", "parent": "16", "title": ""}
