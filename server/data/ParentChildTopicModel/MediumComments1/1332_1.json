{"content": "Thanks for considering this question. Great topic. I \u201cliked\u201d your question: \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering difference, begging the question why women generally don\u2019t aim higher?\u201d I\u2019m asking: why aren\u2019t dads helping their partners to juggle work and childcare? We need to get out of the stereotypes imposed by patriarchism. I\u2019m asking: When will all employees provide flexible work arrangements and start treating their employees like responsible adults, judging them on their results? How many of your interviewees have children? I think when you become parents, things change a lot: you have less time for long hours at work, you want to pick up your child from nursery or school, childcare is expensive (not an incentive to go back to work!). In a (still) patriarchal society, women are often the ones who pick up all the above tasks for their kids. It becomes hard to join start-ups where most employees either do not have a family or use their partner to provide childcare. Trust me, I am a mother, a designer with experience of working for start-ups. We are told that men are leaders from childhood, it\u2019s no wonder we have this disparity. My daughter watches CBBC in the morning it is shocking to see that in many (not all) cartoons, all leaders are male and females are vastly under-represented.
