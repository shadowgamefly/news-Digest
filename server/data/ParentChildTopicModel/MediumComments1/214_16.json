{"content": "Darius, the only thing that has kept me from keeping a journal in my life has been the fear that someone else may read it. I have never wanted to record trauma, or to bring shame upon anyone I know. Stupid, I suppose. I\u2019ve started over and over since I was a child, and everything went swimmingly until another trauma hit, and I stopped cold, not wanting to record it. I\u2019ve read the entire diaries of Anais Nin, and should be more brave. My journal exists in my poetry, and in my heart, and in the memoir/novel in the works.
