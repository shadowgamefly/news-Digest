{"content": "I do not have the same familiarity with HB-1 that you and TheLizard display. (My apologies to The Lizard for omitting him from my list of good Conservative reads.) Truthfully, I know very little about our immigration process. I will try to do some homework on that. The objection I raised, however, similar to most Trump supporters is not to say \u201cNo more immigration\u201d. The cry to \u201cProtect Our Borders\u201d is a demand to curtail the seemingly ceaseless flow of illegal aliens. If someone is here and has been naturalized, great. Welcome! If people are here on Visa or with a green card, awesome. If they are aliens who slipped through the borders and bypassed those steps, whitewashing them through amnesty as promoted by GWB and McCain much to the hurrahs of the Left, is a betrayal of American trust and grossly unfair to millions of potential immigrants who patiently abided by our naturalization laws. The Left has painted a huge swastika over people who say \u201cProtect Our Borders\u201d. That is political rhetoric. Few Democrats promoting the DREAM Act give a damn about the welfare of illegal aliens. They just see a massive blue voting bloc. America has admitted more immigrants in the past 200 years than probably any 3 countries in history combined. They come with the promise of freedom and an opportunity for growth the surpasses what anybody in history has ever had. It is a privilege and few seem to respect that privilege with the reverence of first generation Americans. That reverence is lost and that privilege is watered down to meaninglessness if our leaders say \u201cDon\u2019t break our laws to get in, or we will make you an American\u201d. By the way, the Yiddish was really good. \u201cBubbe\u201d or \u201cbubby\u201d means grandmother and adding \u201cla\u201d or \u201cle\u201d in Yiddish adds the term \u201clittle\u201d. I\u2019ve often heard the term \u201cbubbele\u201d and knew it was being used to say \u201clittle dear one\u201d, but never realized it was a euphemism. Now, I need to figure out the etymology of its synonym, \u201cshaifela\u201d. ", "child": "", "name": "441_3", "parent": "441", "title": ""}
