{"content": "Think Progress uses the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d to describe anyone they disagree with. Richard Spencer, who actually is a white nationalist and is an acquaintance of Miller, says that Miller is not a white nationalist. The term \u201calt-right\u201d is so loosely used by leftist publications that it has almost no meaning. A better description of Miller would be \u201ccultural nationalist,\u201d that is, someone who believes that Western civilization is a superior culture and worth preserving. That does not imply racism\u200a\u2014\u200aunless you agree with the \u201crace realists\u201d that culture is genetically determined. Nor does it imply Christian supremacy. Miller is a practicing Jew. Think Progress is too concerned at pasting derogatory labels on their political opponents and not concerned with advancing public understanding.
