{"content": "I suppose we are after the holy grail of where something, I suppose a primal energy, or actually nothing, somehow becomes mass, or a particle of some kind, or some kind of wave, or a weird hybrid of waves and particles, and if we go far and deep enough, at some point perhaps the necessity of these manifesting at all will become apparent. The reason, if you will, something that may even become an, or the, over arching rational for having a universe. I doubt it, we\u2019ll never get there banging things together, the original act was a synthesis, and science doesn\u2019t recognize such a thing. The big bang theories all start off with totally inexplicables like heat, mass, velocity, things happening, etc., and beg more questions than ever dreaming of answering. However particle physics and its cousin, waves, will lead somewhere though, to better computer chips, batteries, energy components for stuff, alloys, materials, synthetics, and stuff no one has even imagined yet, so it is worth pursuing.
