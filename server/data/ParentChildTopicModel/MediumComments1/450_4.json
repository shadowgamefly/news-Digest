{"content": "Under a fascist, authoritarian president Trump why be surprised that ICE has now become a fascist, authoritarian, abusive agency arresting people for the minor of offenses. Think the GOP or the media will remind us that immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than average Americans as the GOP and their Fox News media constantly con America into believing that immigrants or Muslims are a significant issue which they are not. Recall that it was Wall St.\u2019s greedy, corrupt banksters NOT immigrants, Muslims, or even hapless minority homeowners that brought down Wall St. and took $16.7 TRILLION from Americans, took five+ million homes, took 10+ million jobs during the Bush Great Recession on top of the five million manufacturing jobs and 60,000 companies shipped overseas or to Mexico. Hypocritically, the GOP have shipped more middle-income jobs to Hispanics in Mexico that undocumented Hispanics have ever taken. Today they are actually more undocumented Asians than Hispanics though the GOP or Trump never mention that. ", "child": "", "name": "450_4", "parent": "450", "title": ""}
