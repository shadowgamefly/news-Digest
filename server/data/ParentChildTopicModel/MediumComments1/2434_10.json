I had to manufacture that vision. I\u2019m like you. I have unbelievable visions while hiking, driving, etc. I\u2019m talking insane shit\u200a\u2014\u200athe latest one involves immersive, AR-powered movie making, levitation and device-free viewing (leaving the viewing mechanism to myself). All this from a non-techie Media Geek. But if we don\u2019t have our visions, forget this line of work. ", "child": "", "name": "2434_10", "parent": "2434", "title": ""}
