{"content": "Both calls are correct. Not just \u201ctechnically correct\u201d, but correct. The Bonnies bench players rushed the court, preventing VCU from making a basketball play: 1 technical foul. A St. Bonnavenure security guard grabbed the game ball, preventing VCU from making a basketball play: 2 technical fouls. And I hadn\u2019t heard about the Bonnies fan contacting an official, but there you go: 3 technical fouls. Any one of those instances could and should draw a technical foul, and it did. From then on, it\u2019s basketball as usual. The GW game is even more cut and dry. It IS straight basketball the entire way. In fact, there could have even been another technical called on GW, as their bench players rushed the court. The only thing preventing a technical being called there was the official had grabbed the ball and stopped play to check the clock. From then on, a bit on genius tactic from VCU coach Will Wade secures an impossible, but absolutely correct foul. Saying anything to the contrary is cynical. Everyone plays under the same set of rules and regulations, and every one of those regulations was followed. Both wins are ugly wins, but: \u201cA win is a win is a win is a win.\u201d ", "child": "", "name": "1511_4", "parent": "1511", "title": ""}
