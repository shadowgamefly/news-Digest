It is a place commonly referred to as America or lovingly, Americana, by its residents. The Democrats forgot this other America in the midst of this election cycle too. It buried the farmers and factory workers in the sea of sub-prime mortgages and croneyism. It lined its pockets with coastal mergers and left out the middle country it had previously devoted itself to.

They must recognize this fatal error if they ever have hopes of being the new populist party. ", "child": "", "name": "514_6", "parent": "514", "title": ""}
