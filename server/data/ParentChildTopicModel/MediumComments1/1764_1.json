{"content": "\u201cYeah, god forbid a black woman tell you how she really feels.\u201d If she wants to express how she really feels, she needs to find a psychotherapist or a sympathetic girlfriend who\u2019s a good listener. This is a public forum. She\u2019s spewing hateful racist vitriol that lumps all white people together and makes angry and ignorant statements about them. I\u2019m not one of those special snowflakes who\u2019s going to demand that this be taken down by Medium\u200a\u2014\u200athough it surely would be taken down by Medium if it were written, in the same hateful spirit, by a white man telling us how he \u201creally feels\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut it\u2019s inappropriate and deserves to be called out for what it is, which is what I did. You say that its tone, though \u201ca bit rant-y\u201d is \u201ca pretty normal tone for a think piece,\u201d and if you\u2019re right about that, I see that as more of a sad comment on the state of what passes for \u201ca think piece\u201d today. This wasn\u2019t a think piece. It was hate speech. If you think that \u201cwhite led anti racism groups do actual harm to people\u2019s lives\u201d (a view I\u2019d disagree with because I don\u2019t think white-led groups are any more unitary in their impact than black-led groups, and each group is different and should be treated differently rather than being lumped together and pre-judged on the basis of race), you\u2019re welcome to explain that view in a logical and thoughtful manner, but telling us things like \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more disappointing or dangerous than a room full of white people,\u201d as her article did, should not pass muster as acceptable civil dialogue in a civilized society.
