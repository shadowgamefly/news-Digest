{"content": "I sort of get where you\u2019re coming from Kevin but I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. One of the downsides of many older pages was that they often resulted in a wall-of-text sensation that made them harder to parse, especially for newcomers. A good example is the Google App Engine screens you posted above. I don\u2019t use them every day, don\u2019t know what the deal with them is. And so to me the second one is more readable. It shows me a clearer order, directs my attention better etc. I too have aging eyes and have found that sometimes I\u2019m having to bump up font sizes or use readability modes or that kind of thing, but more commonly the reason is web advertising has become so terrible that it really interferes with legibility. At the same time I tend to find that many sites (Gmail, say) are much easier to take in than they used to be. Granted some do go a bit nuts with the lightness, the greys and the over-reliance on UX thinking. Still on the whole I think where they are today is better than where they were.
