{"content": "Tristan, thanks for writing such a thoughtful article! I love that you cover \u201cwhat to do\u201d as well as \u201cwhat NOT to do\u201d. As an analyst / data nerd who\u2019s seen several small businesses struggle with analytics, I know that some businesses underestimate the importance of having clean and relevant data, but several others \u201cjump the gun\u201d and are totally obsessed with a level of analytics that the company is just not ready for. For any businesses out there who are exploring tools for analytics, remember that the data out is only as good as the data in. As such, don\u2019t fall into the trap of \u201cI have a GA account, therefore my company is data driven\u201d. Invest the time and resources to understand each tool\u2019s strengths and shortcomings, understand which suit your data best, and please (please PLEASEEEE) hire help to make sure all the data you\u2019re tracking is accurate and actionable. Above all, be honest about the current needs and priorities of your company. ", "child": "", "name": "924_8", "parent": "924", "title": ""}
