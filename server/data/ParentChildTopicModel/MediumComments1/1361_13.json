{"content": "A Guide for Conservatives who seem to lack perspective: Social Welfare Programs do not Promote Single Parenthood. Prior to Ronald Reagan it was true that many states did not allow assistance for intact Families- leading to migration to states that did. Reagan ended that practice in 1985- because California never had it-though there may be that prejudice still in some areas. The fact that it allows the escape from Abusive Relationships is a net good.Few if any Minimum Wage jobs are anywhere near Full time. Many only have 20-24 hours/week. In my City where the cheapest 2bdrm Apt rents for $775 & the average wage is $11($10.06 after Tax)- a parent would have to work 77 Hours/month just to pay it. Then there is the cost of Utilities.

Employers prefer these people because they have less conflict in their lives due to lack of dependents. These people need less,they can stay at home with parents or share housing with others to lower overhead thereby surviving on their wages. They never have a sick child or lack of child care or other parent issues & if they aren\u2019t worth it you can flat out let them go if they come in Hungover.
