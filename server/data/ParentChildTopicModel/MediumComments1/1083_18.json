{"content": "This skimpy health plan could actually lead to more abortions. A women faced with a $20,000 or more maternity bill might logically decide on another option. If prenatal care is not covered, think of the increased risks to the child. What happens if the mother does not have healthcare and then has a premature child or a high risk child that costs sadly over a million dollars. Who is going to pay that bill? We all are. Logically an insurance company would want to cover birth control to prevent pregnancies. They save money. Logically a insurance company would want to cover preventive care like colonoscopies, diabetes testing, and statins for heart disease. Those costs are a lot less than colon cancer, diabetes\u00a0, and a heart attack. The healthcare bill is basically a tax cut for the rich and a huge increase in costs for everyone else. Make America Sick, Poor, Hungry, and Dead is the real intent of this bill. ", "child": "", "name": "1083_18", "parent": "1083", "title": ""}
