{"content": "Good to see that females aren\u2019t immune from inflicting racist terror! I\u2019m tired of people acting as if women are immune from the same sadistic impulses that is present in men. That said, this article also has some excessive white guilt, something that those with non-white ancestry (which includes some of my ancestries) don\u2019t really need from white allies. Here\u2019s just one example <QUOTE> But in the Black-ish episode \u201cBeing Bow-racial,\u201d Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s character Rainbow gets touchy when her son comes home with a white girlfriend. It\u2019s not because she\u2019s being \u201cracist\u201d (eye roll) but because as a brown woman in America, she is well acquainted with the harm that white women are capable of.<UNQUOTE> In other words, she discriminates against her son\u2019s white girlfriend because she had a bad experience with someone who looks like her son\u2019s white girlfriend. In other words, she is a racist herself. (I\u2019m using the dictionary definition of \u201cracist\u201d not the politically correct SJW definition) It\u2019s like the real people I know who become racist because \u201cthose people picked on me\u201d. In other words, their racist attitude shows they\u2019re becoming just as bad as the people who picked on them! ", "child": "", "name": "536_16", "parent": "536", "title": ""}
