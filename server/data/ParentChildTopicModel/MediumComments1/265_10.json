{"content": "Great read! Your \u201cliberal\u201d use of the term liberal is a great example of the state of the political discourse in the world today. Sports writing has not got more \u201cliberal\u201d, it has become left. A liberal would be for open and honest discussions about politics, sexuality, drugs etc. Sports writers have become echo chambers for leftist ideologies that are poisoning a generation. I was a big fan fan of Keeping it 1600, I now listen to Pod Save America. I also listen to Sam Harris, Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shaprio. I love Real Time and Bill Maher but hate Trevor Noah and the Daily Show. I would love to see sports writing take a much more \u201ccenter\u201d approach rather than flogging left wing ideologies that are rooted in feelings and identity politics. Keep up the great work, The Ringer is my favorite website! ", "child": "", "name": "265_10", "parent": "265", "title": ""}
