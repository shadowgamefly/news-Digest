{"content": "I have noticed that followers seem to trickle in the more I write (thus the more volume is out there for discovery). I think I started out with about 250 followers, which was a direct migration of Twitter followers who also happen to be on Medium. The bulk of my followers has come since I started doing this whole one post a day for a year thing. I\u2019m almost 150 days in, so that\u2019s a lot of volume buildup. I think the main thing that drives high numbers of views is sharing outside of Medium via social networks and also the greater viewership of some of the publications. Even when I had featured articles in one of Medium\u2019s categories at the top of the feed, it didn\u2019t boost views that much. So I agree. This place is weird all right!
