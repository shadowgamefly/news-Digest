{"content": "Literature has racist gatekeepers that silence the perspectives of creators of color, and TV and film are no different. Previously, when the subject of dangerous white women has been broached, it was done almost with kid gloves or with a plot device built in that protected the white woman in question from the criticism directed toward her. Consider 1996\u2019s The Craft, which is often called a feminist film (a claim that baffles me, I admit). In it, the lone Black girl Rochelle, played by Rachel True, is victim to racist bullying by a blonde cheerleader-type who at one point blatantly says \u201cI don\u2019t like Negroids.\u201d This could have been an example of white women\u2019s violence laid bare\u2026especially given the fact that Rochelle is able to take a small amount of revenge by casting a spell that make the white girl\u2019s hair fall out. Yet the film ends up punishing Rochelle for acting against the racist harm inflicted on her by the white girl: toward the end of The Craft, Rochelle gets her comeuppance when her own hair falls out in a hallucination. Message: \u201cWhite women may do bad stuff, but you\u2019re just as bad if you defend yourself\u2026and look how upset the white girl was! Don\u2019t you feel sorry for her?\u201d", "child": "", "name": "536_4", "parent": "536", "title": ""}
