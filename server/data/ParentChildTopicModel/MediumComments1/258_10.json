{"content": "So far I find Medium\u2019s series thing kinda weird and clumsy. I also don\u2019t like that I have no idea how long anything is at the start. I like to know what I\u2019m getting into before I\u2019m 30 minutes in and no end in sight. I\u2019m still not that big a fan of reading, much less creating content, on my phone. I prefer my laptop and a full keyboard to work with. But at 48 I realize I am no one\u2019s target demo anymore. Enjoy your thumb cramps, kiddos! Hopefully the mind reader interface is coming soon. Not to mention, great that Medium might make money out of this, but how do I!? Do I get a cut when the ads get plastered on my stuff? ", "child": "", "name": "258_10", "parent": "258", "title": ""}
