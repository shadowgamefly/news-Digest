{"content": "Nicole, One suggestion: If you\u2019re a freelander and making decent money as a solo entrepreneur, you ought to look at incorporating yourself. All those taxes you pay could be greatly reduced as activities you can\u2019t deduct today become tax-deductible business expenses. In fact, an an S-corporation, you can pay yourself a salary, which should incur fewer taxes than you pay today. I\u2019m not a tax expert, but my accountant is, and he advised me to get incorporated 17 years ago when I worked as a contractor. That has worked out pretty well. You might want to ask the person who prepares your taxes about the pros and cons of getting incorporated. It won\u2019t cost anything\u200a\u2014\u200aor much\u200a\u2014\u200ato ask.
