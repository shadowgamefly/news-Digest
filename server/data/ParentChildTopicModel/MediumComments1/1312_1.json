{"content": "In the world of Machine Learning, solving an OCR problem is a classification problem. We build up a set of trained data, for example the digits from the image processing, classify them as something, and then use that data to match any new images. Once I got the basic image isolation working, I created a script that could loop over a folder of images, run the digit isolation code, and then save the cropped digits into a new folder for me to review. After that ran, I\u2019d have a folder of untrained digits that I could then use to train a system.", "child": "", "name": "1312_1", "parent": "1312", "title": ""}
