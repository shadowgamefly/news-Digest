{"content": "Lorraine, you make a good point. I didn\u2019t take his saying \u201cmoral superiority\u201d as better than other people\u2019s morals, but i certainly see how it can read that way. Our lack of humility is a serious issue in this country. It\u2019s good to be proud, but when we think we are better than other people/countries, that is a recipe for trouble.
