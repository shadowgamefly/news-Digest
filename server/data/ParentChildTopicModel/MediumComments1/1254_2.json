{"content": "Discrete Scale Relativity predicts that the object at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is not a black hole, but rather a gravitational singularity that is thinly veiled but has no conventional event horizon at roughly the Schwarzschild radius. If the observations described in Ethan\u2019s article are able to definitively detect or rule out a conventional event horizon, then we have an interesting test of DSR. Additionally, since the MWG is rotating, DSR predicts a ring singularity at the center, rather than a point singularity. This constitutes a second test of DSR\u2019s model for the MWG. 4/11/17 Update: Observations have been completed, and now the months-long period of analyses begins; see: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/dark-star-diaries/clear-skies-with-a-chance-of-black-holes/ Fractal CosmologyRobert Oldershaw's Fractal Cosmology Site: Cosmology, Fractals, Self-similarity, Hierarchical, Dark Matter\u2026www3.amherst.edu ", "child": "", "name": "1254_2", "parent": "1254", "title": ""}
