{"content": "Hi Mark, great response, thank you! I also happen to be one the investors backing Ubeam (through OurCrowd) and your articles have given me a great deal of comfort with the company and team. A proposition as bold as Ubeam's will always have its doubters and naysayers and, while the company could indeed fail (investors and stakeholders should always prepared for that), at least I get the feeling that it is honestly trying to deliver. Ubeam reminds me more of Tesla Motors than Theranos and I believe they will eventually prove the bashers to be wrong. If I could leave a suggestion, I think it could be really helpfull if you (or one of the other famous investors in the company) could talk about your own experiences with the prototypes. Even if you can't talk specifics about the tech or how it works, it would go a long way if you back Meredith and Ubeam as a witness to what they have already demonstrated to you. Your reputation is your strongest asset in this situation.Thank you for your leadership and support to the company! ", "child": "", "name": "2433_4", "parent": "2433", "title": ""}
