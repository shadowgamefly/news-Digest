{"content": "A motivative piece! I\u2019m going to WRITE though I\u2019m a 75 years 4 months and 11 days old exactly. I mention my age like all new arrivals do as they are vested with the right to express their ages in this way. I\u2019m profoundly hearing- impaired as I won\u2019t be able to hear the latest US air strikes on Syria. I believe in whenever I happen to write I will have ONE faithful reader who will read my piece everyday regularly or for several times in the day with great appreciation, adoration and enthusiasm. Her name is MAY MAY as everybody calls her affectionately MAY MAY. I have a tittle, \u201cEverybody loves me and calls me May May!\u201d Writing is this much SIMPLE to me. BE and that\u2019s it!
