I also feel like this suggestion contradicts a later one with checkboxes and radios, where you encourage to stack them to make them easier to scan. It would be interesting to research the positive impact of stacking for scanning against having the options hidden behind a click. ", "child": "", "name": "1473_25", "parent": "1473", "title": ""}
