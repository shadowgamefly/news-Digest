{"content": "I\u2019ve always chose to outline strokes but I can definitely see the benefit of sketch\u2019s ability to reorient the path whenever you\u2019re using outer/inner strokes. The masking approach that I\u2019ve seen is very annoying because it alters the structure of the SVG in such a way where it makes it more difficult (if not impossible) to manipulate the SVG in code. I definitely applaud the Sketch developers for finding such an awesome solution and I appreciate you shedding some light on the different workarounds.
