{"content": "Something not emphasized enough is the developer convenience of introspection and self-documentation, which is built into the spec. As you build your types and you document that code, it automatically becomes information available to the client coder through introspection with tools like GraphiQL. That is a huge time saver for the devs building the API and those using it. The other winning aspect is, it is a specification which forms a standardization (whether it becomes A standard is still to be seen). At any rate, being a specification means great tooling, easier usage, wider interoperability among services all are much simpler to achieve. I think that alone makes GraphQL hard to avoid.
