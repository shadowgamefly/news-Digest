{"content": "Hello! Thank you for wonderful article with insights, but\u2026 I\u2019 am a total newbie, sitting on Windows 10 machine and wondering for about and hour and half how to run this script and start automating the process. I have nothing in common with programming languages and all of that seems to be like a black magic for me. I\u2019ve already installed Python and edited some files but\u2026 don\u2019t know how to run it. I really don\u2019t understand how can I make it work. If you\u2019re a good soul or something and want to help me\u2026 then please, I will be more than grateful. I can also donate some money for someone who will help me with running this script and making it work on my account. Thanks in advance guys.\u00a0:) ", "child": "", "name": "1351_8", "parent": "1351", "title": ""}
