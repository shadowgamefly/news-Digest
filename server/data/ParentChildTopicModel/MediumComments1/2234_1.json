{"content": "That\u2019s all going to seemingly get flipped on its head once Toretto gets turned by a vicious hacker named Cipher. I guess it\u2019s not fair to spoil how she persuades Toretto to betray everything he stands for \u2014 but if it didn\u2019t entail preying on Toretto\u2019s love of family, would this even be a Fast & Furious movie? Cipher, apparently the most powerful hacker in the world, is actually a funny choice of villain. You know the Fast & Furious franchise is officially post\u2013Racing Movie when the bad guy is a hacker with dreadlocks \u2014 played by Charlize Theron! The movie is wild. Here are some of Theron\u2019s finest lines: \u201cIt\u2019s zombie time!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to beg. I want you to burn.\u201d Spooky stuff. On the flip side, there\u2019s also lazy cheese like \u201cMake it rain\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started\u201d \u2014 the quality control here is, as always, inconsistent. It\u2019s not a great character.", "child": "", "name": "2234_1", "parent": "2234", "title": ""}
