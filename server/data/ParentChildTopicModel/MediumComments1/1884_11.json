{"content": "Ted, it happened to me also. Doc asked me if I was on a diet, I\u2019d lost weight since my last appointment, \u201cNo, no diet.\u201d Having problems swallowing meat or dense foods? \u201cYes.\u201d Off for Endoscopy. Gastro guy didn\u2019t sugar coat it, \u201cYou have Esophageal Cancer.\u201d Completely unexpected, I had no clue. The next day my regular doctor said, \u201cDon\u2019t read the statistics on the internet.\u201d So I did. There was no good news on the internet. In fact, it was very bad, prognosis was poor on every site, and everyone I knew that knew someone or was related to someone with it, had bad news about their outcome. I sold some machinery that I had in my garage (my wife didn\u2019t need to get stuck with 3 tons of cast iron machinery if things went completely south), and started chemo and radiation, concurrently. Other than the first day, I worked every day during chemo and radiation. When that finished, they removed my esophagus. That was 3 years ago. Other than right at the beginning when I looked at those statistics regarding longevity and the low probability of curing it, I was not expecting to die from it, I didn\u2019t even consider it, other than writing a living will. I don\u2019t know if my thinking positive about it (not even considering the alternative) had any influence on it, I did have complete faith in my doctors, did what they said, and it seems like I\u2019m good to go. It certainly did change the way I think about things now, the stuff that used to seem important to me, doesn\u2019t any more. ", "child": "", "name": "1884_11", "parent": "1884", "title": ""}
