{"content": "Hi David, thank you for reading and providing the additional examples of those who showed their hand. I was unaware of MeetUp\u2019s resist groups.

In the past, even if you knew that a CEO or politician leaned a particular way, there wasn\u2019t much you could do about it, but public shaming has returned to society with force, so it\u2019s particularly difficult to show your hand or not these days.
