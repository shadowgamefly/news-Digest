{"content": "The problem I see with worldbuilding is that readers have come to expect books to meet a standard that the author can\u2019t possibly (and probably isn\u2019t trying to) meet. When I\u2019ve taught fiction classes, I\u2019ve often seen that when students encounter a book outside of the modes of actual realism or faux worldbuilding realism, they don\u2019t know how to evaluate it. They believe that a different way of seeing reality aren\u2019t invitations to see reality in a new way yourself, but simply failures of worldbuilding.", "child": "", "name": "692_2", "parent": "692", "title": ""}
