Chances are he knows if they were disclosed any \u2018doctoring\u2019 of the records would be discovered under scrutiny. By the time he does disclose he should have someone do a switch with the ones held by the IRS. For sure this is big. But, I\u2019m wondering if the taxes of all the spawn and wifey including the son-in-law can be checked as well. Sometimes the answers are hiding right in front of you. So I\u2019d look closer to home also. In monopoly when you throw the dice sometimes you land in jail, and have to get a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 or throw 3 \u2018sixes\u2019 in succession\u200a\u2014\u200aif I remember correctly. By getting into the presidency he thinks he has the \u2018get out of jail\u2019 card. Maybe he is right if all the crooks surround him.
