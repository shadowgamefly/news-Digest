{"content": "Love. This. Nataly. I was once told by a client of mine (in marketing) that I was \u201caggressive and hostile,\u201d in response to putting forth so much energy and effort to come up with a solution in an emergency situation. However, my own colleagues (and even her colleagues), said that I was calm, cool, collective, and direct with how I handled everything, and that her description was used to merely tear me down. There is roughly a 20 year age difference between myself and this woman, so I can\u2019t help but feel that she was intimidated by my assertiveness and quick thinking\u2014and it made her uncomfortable. I really allowed myself to be torn up over these comments for a long time\u2014even though I had the support of my colleagues and other clients. Reading this, and reflecting on the situation, I cannot tell you how important it is for women to support other aggressive, ass-kicking women. It\u2019s vital\u2014we must step out of our comfort zone in this area. ", "child": "", "name": "918_19", "parent": "918", "title": ""}
