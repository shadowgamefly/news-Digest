{"content": "Good morning! Today is the first day of the last year of my 20s! I did NOT do an estimate, but I DID spend money so here goes: Friday, I stayed in and did some work. Saturday was another friend\u2019s birthday celebration in Prospect Park. I made cookies to bring ($13.76 for ingredients). We switched locations to a nearby bar once it started to rain. Afterwards, my boyfriend and I went to Calexico for drunk eats and a night cap ($33.22). I paid for a cab back to Queens ($34.80). Sunday, I went to my favorite coffee shop in the morning for more work ($7 for coffee and an amazing blueberry scone). I stayed for a couple hours then went home and ordered Thai for lunch ($19.19). Later, my parents came in and treated me to birthday dinner. So basically all I did on Sunday was eat. Total: $107.97 ", "child": "", "name": "1623_20", "parent": "1623", "title": ""}
