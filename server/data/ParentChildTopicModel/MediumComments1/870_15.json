{"content": "In the US, every monopoly by an \u201cevil corporation\u201d was granted to them by the government. There\u2019s no better way to obtain one. Every time the government is allowed to \u201cregulate\u201d an industry, it gets into bed with that industry. Individual companies or industry lobbyists write the proposed legislation, which is always self beneficial, and the legislators push and pass it for kickbacks. Such corporate cronyism is rampant. We should be suspicious of any government control of any essential service. I\u2019ll take fair competition in a free market over a government-regulated faux market any day. When companies have to actually compete with one another on the merits of their quality and price, and when new players can enter the market with fresh and disruptive ideas, THAT is when consumers win.
