{"content": "Great post! For me, the ideal interview would be having the possibility to work for a day with the interviewee. Giving him a easy task, see how he interacts with tools and specially with the rest of the team. Having lunch with him, going for a coffee, it would give you a much more precise feeling on how much you would like to work with him or not! Also, I personally struggle with the question \u201cgive me an example of a difficult situation you had to deal with\u201d, because it depends a lot on your perception of those situations and how you deal with pressure\u200a\u2014\u200aif I feel that I never went through a difficult situation, what does it say about me?
