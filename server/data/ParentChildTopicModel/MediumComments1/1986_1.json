{"content": "Then again, this is the type of play that happens all the time at the ends of games and goes uncalled, so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair to blame Rodriguez for not making a play on the ball either. Also, so much of what made the play look bad was Barford being inadvertently tripped by Rodriguez, leading many to wonder if the play would still have been considered a flagrant foul had Barford remained upright. I\u2019m not sure what the right answer is. I just know that we were robbed of what may have been an all-time March Madness moment had the referees not assessed the play the way they did, and that truly sucks. I also know that, along with yesterday\u2019s fouling mistake at the end of the Northwestern-Vanderbilt game, this means the two biggest moments of the 2017 NCAA tournament have been fouls. THE MADNESS IS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO HANDLE.", "child": "", "name": "1986_1", "parent": "1986", "title": ""}
