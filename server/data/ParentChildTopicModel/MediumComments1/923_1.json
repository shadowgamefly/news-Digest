{"content": "Really nice post Mathilde. I recognize a lot! We also opened up the roadmap since January first, receiving so many nice responses from users. I feel you dissapoint users a lot les, by not building everything they ask for. As they can actually see how many people find a certain feature interesting. They seem to understand the process a lot better when they are able to see it themselves. Also I received some responses from new users who had a look at the public roadmap and saw that the one feature they would like to have will be build quickly. Your part about actually adding their features to the roadmap we haven\u2019t tried yet, we now filter them. But will definitely try it out!
