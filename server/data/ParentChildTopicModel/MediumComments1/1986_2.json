{"content": "There\u2019s an all-time bumber crop of cornucopia in CBB pods this year, but only one\u2019s essential: the one with Tait Titus & Mark Frazier (their KenPom Adjusted Podcast Efficacy nom). I\u2019m so freaking old, I remember whippersnappers, when every radio market had a station with a morning show with some local \u201cwit\u201d who\u2019d read an article or two from a local newspapers or newswire, and from there segue into a live demonstration of his \u201cwit\u201d or a contrived satire off what he\u2019d just read. I think a lot of that was owed to radio types listening to Bob & Ray & wanting to riff off their bits, such as live investigative pieces from roving reporter Wally Ballou, Arthur Sturdley\u2019s radiotorials, and Biff Burns with The Inside Skinny from The World Of Sports. Been a half century or so since I listened regularly to anything approaching that vibe, T\u2019d Up is the closest thing to it, & One Vibrating Reason why I don\u2019t want this CBB season to ever end. Greg Howard, I think you could be overlooking The Unwritten Rules. ", "child": "", "name": "1986_2", "parent": "1986", "title": ""}
