{"content": "I saw a film about Desert Dawg at the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour, and his human was talking about how loving a dog makes you a better person. He said something like: you give them a few years of your life, and they give you all of theirs. Your piece just made me choke up even more than that one.
