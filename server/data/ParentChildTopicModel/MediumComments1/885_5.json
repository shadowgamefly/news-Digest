{"content": "I am not Islam, and my country and people are having many problems with those claiming to represent Allah. Nuff said. We have a more respectful, though not 100% even-steven, place of women. They are not \u201cproperty\u201d and are in a superior spiritual state, thus not obligated to many disciplines that men need to \u201cstay in line.\u201d Whatever the details, the faith, as initiated by Abraham and Moses, or by the Prophet, represents an anchor. A ship navigating the turbulent seas of life needs an anchor. Children grow up in those waves and tidal forces need an anchor and parents who have/provide an anchor. So do not dismiss faith nor belittle it. Your parents meant well and you did not fail anyone. Just keep hands on the line. Learn more Quran, learn more Yoga, learn and learn. You\u2019ll find a path.
