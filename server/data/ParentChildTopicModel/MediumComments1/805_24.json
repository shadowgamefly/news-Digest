{"content": "Nice article Elliot, thanks for sharing your experience. Like you, I\u2019ve been interested on the 8pt grid since listening to Bryn Jackson talking about that regularly. At EDITED we\u2019ve started using a 8pt scale as we modernise our marketing website to React. The scale we\u2019re using has just a small difference, as we actually have a 4pt value for the first position of the scale. This is the scale we\u2019re currently using: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 120 I\u2019m preparing a few more technical posts for https://inside.edited.com/ and will definitely spend some time on this, thanks for the inspiration!
