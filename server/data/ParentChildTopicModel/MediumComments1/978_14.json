{"content": " Loving these email blogs. Lately I\u2019ve become obsessed with marketing, attention and creative ideas to make the best out of both. I\u2019m an electrician and have been since i left school, 7 years ago, but never did i pick up a regulations book at 22:00 and start reading it and consuming every word. Until recently all i ever knew was you have to study hard, learn a trade, get a good job and turn up on time every day. I had no idea these kind of things existed like agencies, marketing, entrepreneurship, going into charity shops finding a Disney soft toy for 50p and selling it on eBay for \u00a310. I\u2019d like to thank Gary and Tai Lopez for teaching me that self education and self awareness are the 2 key things in life. ", "child": "", "name": "978_14", "parent": "978", "title": ""}
