{"content": "Ready to meet your soul mate? It\u2019s you. Entrepreneurship is the most life changing relationship (like marriage or parenthood) that a person can have. You will be confronted overandoverandover with your fears, your insecurities, your crappy excuses, your limitations, your justifications, your shitty integrity, and your inefficient time management. The standard you held yourself to in the work-a-day world was good enough then, but it won\u2019t be good enough to run your own business. And you will learn to accept yourself through all this because in order to get up every day and create a profit, you have to. Somehow through that process of acceptance, while you\u2019re busy putting yourself out there in spite of your flaws, your weaknesses will transform and you will fall in love with yourself. Not in the over-hyped \u201cSELF LOVE 2012\u201d way, but in a quiet way that sneaks up on you after witnessing a thousand splinter-sized moments of transcending the baser aspects of yourself.", "child": "", "name": "2446_3", "parent": "2446", "title": ""}
