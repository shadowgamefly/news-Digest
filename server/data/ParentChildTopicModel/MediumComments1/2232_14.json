Given the impact that A24 has had in the past couple of years (& oscars won\u200a\u2014\u200aBest Pic this year, Best Doc last year) it\u2019s a glaring miss to not mention that company and the way that it\u2019s championing new independent voices outside of the streamers. A24 selects titles well and spend little on marketing and really use organic methods to drive their titles\u200a\u2014\u200awhich has made them success both critically and financially.

Neon and Tim League\u2019s theater chain Alamo Drafthouse are big champions of theatrical\u200a\u2014\u200aand making theaters a better experience.
