{"content": "Being a die hard Bucs fan, I made the drive from Washington State in October for the Niners/Bucs game\u2026 I loved the Stadium. But that was about it. Parking was a mile walk, and I paid $60 to park my damn car in the lot\u2026. The same lot it then took over an hour to get out of. It was a mess.. And there were more Bucs fans at the game than niners fans.. It was amazing. Overall we had a fantastic experience, and the Bucs won.. Which made it even better\u2026 But I thought the stadium was beautiful. However, having been to many other NFL stadiums, it lacked the ambiance that so many others provide on sunday afternoons. But none the less, the stadium itself was great. It was just everything else they dont have going for them. ", "child": "", "name": "1644_17", "parent": "1644", "title": ""}
