{"content": "I think we ought to move toward minimising toxic impact of grades, but I hesitate to use the word \u2018gradeless\u2019 when there is still a final grade on the report card. Currently, my class and department runs on formative assessment with feedback and conferencing, issuing grades about four times a year on items kids choose from a portfolio and that have been through a revision process \u2013 and that can be revised in future. Often, kids grade their own work using the rubrics and I merely confirm their judgement. We use the mode or most recent on report cards to avoid the damage of averaging. I do value having a few numbers on the table before report cards since we need to put a number on the report. That being said, I have almost never had a conversation with a parent or kid about the number. They too care more about a conversation about learning and what their kid is reading. All that\u2019s to say that I take a humane approach to formative assessment and grading \u2013 humane both for the kids and myself \u2013 but I think it muddies the waters to call it \u2018gradeless\u2019 which makes it sound like the constraints of the system have shifted when they have not. I look forward to reading more! As always, Benjamin ", "child": "", "name": "1348_5", "parent": "1348", "title": ""}
