{"content": "My memory is really bad already, but here\u2019s an approximate estimate: Friday: $0! Went to youth group (free), was too tired for coffee and donuts afterward. Saturday: Around $120 on new clothes (I stacked a sale and a coupon!) then around $30 on bras (I bought two! For $30! Tax included!) then around $33 on my meal at the bachelorette party and $18 for my ticket to the drag show. The bride\u2019s mom paid for drinks. (oh, yes\u200a\u2014\u200amoms were invited to the bachelorette party.) Sunday: $4, I think, in the collection plate at church (a last-minute scramble to get my money ready = $4?) and that is it. I got a free lunch (woo!) and took public transit or got rides to and from my photo shoot and comedy show. Total: $205 ", "child": "", "name": "1623_16", "parent": "1623", "title": ""}
