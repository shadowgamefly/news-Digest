{"content": "Morning, Mike.If you\u2019re not enjoying your home page, I don\u2019t see how you could find value in membership at all. I\u2019m paying for this front page and I wouldn\u2019t want to miss it anymore. Medium could hike the price and I would pay that too.\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah I\u2019m a sucker lol. But, Just to clear a small thing up: \u201cLit\u201d is not \u201cpaywall\u201d it\u2019s just a header you can have on your homepage, or not. You go to the \u2018topics\u2019 at the bottom of your home page and click it, then click on \u201cFollow\u201d   So this \u2018Lit\u2019 thing, it\u2019s just like your story becoming editor\u2019s pick or getting on the main page from before the membership.
