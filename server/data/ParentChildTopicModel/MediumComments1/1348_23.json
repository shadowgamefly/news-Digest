{"content": "Thanks for the response, Jesse. I would really recommend you at least read the linked Alfie Kohn article. I think you\u2019ll see that the research is pretty clear: grades don\u2019t help us \u201cadvance.\u201d And I personally don\u2019t like preparing kids to \u201ccope\u201d with the educational malpractice they may experience later. Nor am I recommending a new fad, as the research on these ideas is now decades and decades old. Grades are a relatively recent development in the history of education, one driven by the priorities of a bygone age. I personally believe they\u2019re part of the reason we\u2019re stuck in a curriculum developed by the Committee of Ten during the Second Industrial Age. In short, grades are part of that regimen of carrots and sticks schools use to extrinsically manage and motivate students. As you\u2019ll read in the Kohn article, they actually have the opposite effect. But perhaps more importantly, as Daniel Pink points out in his book Drive, this approach produces the worst results when it comes to engendering the kind of deep, nuanced, complex thinking we\u2019ll need to confront the definitional tasks of the 21st century tasks. As Pink states in his TED talk, If we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century, the solution is not to do more of the wrong things, entice people with a sweeter carrot, or threaten them with a sharper stick. We need a whole new approach. Here\u2019s the full talk for that if you\u2019re interested:  I know I haven\u2019t gotten into a lot of specifics in this admittedly short article. I hope you\u2019ll consider checking out some more of the resources and seeing why this approach is so needed. Thanks for reading. ", "child": "", "name": "1348_23", "parent": "1348", "title": ""}
