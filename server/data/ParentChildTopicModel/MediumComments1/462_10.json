{"content": "Who cares what Wallace Global Fund \u201cfor a sustainable future\u201d says or does. From the name, I thought this was a legitimate business. It\u2019s not. From their website\u2026their mission is to \u201cadvance womens empowerment, create a fossil free environment, and challenge corporate power. Any surprise they are anything anti-conservative? So, bottom line is this article is nonsense news\u2026. I would challenge the writer who is seemingly obsessed about Trump\u2019s wealth to dig into how the Clinton\u2019s acquired massive wealth during their lifetimes committed to public service\u2026.or Obama who was a \u201cgrass roots\u201d organizer before president has acquired his millions. Face it, most career politicians become rich while governing you. I want to see that story\u2026not some story about someone who was already rich. Stop the double standard!
