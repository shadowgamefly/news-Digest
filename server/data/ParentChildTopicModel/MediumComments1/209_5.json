{"content": "Na\u00efve. Super by Erlend Loe\nAnother funny and entertaining book. Loe is from Norway, and I like his minimal style. It\u2019s a story about a young kid who\u2019s searching for meaning in life. Way better than all the corny self-help parables like The Alchemist. This book is down to earth and fun to read.", "child": "", "name": "209_5", "parent": "209", "title": ""}
