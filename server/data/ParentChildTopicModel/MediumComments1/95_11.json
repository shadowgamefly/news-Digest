{"content": "Great article, its refreshing to see the Nuggets back in the national press coverage. Jokic is the impetus for the chatter, but I think in the coming years this team will be in a place to fight the Jazz for one of the top 4 seeds in the West (after the Clippers inevitable collapse). Everywhere you look this team is full of young talent and potential. Not mentioned above but rookie Juancho Hernangomez is shooting\u00a0.435 from beyond the arc and is basically an afterthought. Gary Harris is one of the smartest players I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to watch in a Nuggets uniform and he is only 22 years old. With a core of Jokic, Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and down the line Juancho there is nothing but a positive outlook in Denver. Lets just hope the Kroenke\u2019s realize the opportunity they have in front of them and give the team time to grow into a perennial powerhouse.
