{"content": "A few questions in regards to the emoluments clause: 1-how long will the republicans let tRump get away with doing what he is doing? 2- how will effect the republicans at election time after they have allowed him to get away with violating the clause? To me every republican who allows this should be held accountable at the next election. We need to shout it out how they enabled this corrupt man to further corrupt our government. It is so blatantly obvious that the republicans will allow him to violate every principle of our Constitution with impunity and they need to be held accountable for it. tRump never had any intention of backing off from his business interests, he cannot pass up a buck. He slobbers over money and cannot turn away from it. That alone makes him a prime target for blackmail. Who knows, it may already be going on.I would place a bet that it is. But we have the foxes guarding the henhouse and that is never the best option. Our checks and balances are gone and it is a free for all for those of tRump\u2019s ilk. Here\u2019s hoping voters realize what they are doing and take action when they can. Although from the last election the voters seem to turn a blind eye to the junk these people do and then complain that there is corruption in government. Well here we have corruption hitting them in the face with a club and very few even seem to notice it. I will work the next election all I can to get out the republicans that are currently in office. It may not be enough but I will do what I can. ", "child": "", "name": "459_10", "parent": "459", "title": ""}
