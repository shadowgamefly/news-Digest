{"content": "The headline should be changed to \u201cHow Sportswriting Became a Leftist Profession\u201d, not liberal. The people who currently comprise the \u201cLeft\u201d in America do not espouse liberal or progressive values. As political pundit Dave Rubin eloquently explained in his viral video \u201cWhy I Left the Left\u201d, the reason why many lifelong Democrats decided to cast their vote for Trump in 2016 is because the Democratic party has been hijacked by regressive, close-minded, leftist bullies who talk about diversity in society but will attack anyone with a diverse opinion that doesn\u2019t conform to their worldview. There are millions of \u201cundercover Trump voters\u201d like me who won\u2019t even bother to engage in a debate about political issues with the far left bullies, because they understand that the Left won\u2019t consider alternative points of view. Instead, anyone who doesn\u2019t fall in line and subscribe to their views must be an uneducated racist, xenophobe or white supremacist. The Left has zero self-awareness and still can\u2019t understand why they lost this election and will continue to lose in the future. It\u2019s because of this smug, elite, self-entitled attitude that they know what is right and what is wrong, and you don\u2019t. News flash: there are highly educated, open-minded Americans who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and also voted for Trump in 2016. The far left has hijacked the Democratic party and I can no longer relate. Until the Democratic party gains some self-awareness and starts promoting true liberal values like freedom of speech, they will continue to get clobbered on Election Day. Stay in your echo chamber and keep insulting people who don\u2019t subscribe to your viewpoints, and you\u2019ll get to enjoy Donald Trump as your President until January 2025.
