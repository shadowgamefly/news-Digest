This is easily illustrated with a globe\u200a\u2014\u200acompare the size of Spitsbergen on a Mercator map and the globe. You can make changes to how you do this but you always end up with the same issues. Mercator is so popular because it preserves angles and is easy to use for navigation as a straight line from A-B on the map crosses all lines of latitude at the same angle so you can set a course off the map and sail that and get to where you want to be\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is helpful in a map and although it isn\u2019t the shortest route (which is a great circle) it is generally good enough unless you are sailing or flying across the Pacific. This also means that Google can use Mercator \u201ctiles\u201d to project the world and zoom in and out. Once you move away from navigation you can use projections that better preserve areas but you have to pick what you are trying to represent and in doing that you make decisions\u200a\u2014\u200aall global projections produce extreme distortion at the edges because point C at the top edge of the map also appears at the bottom ", "child": "", "name": "2462_24", "parent": "2462", "title": ""}
