{"content": "Here is my deal, Shaunta. I joined your mailing list\u200a\u2014\u200aI am probably one of that first batch of 13,279\u200a\u2014\u200abecause of what I have said many times before: I love to write, yet I do not want to be a writer. Along with a lot of other documents of all kinds, I read pretty much everything you write online; some of it fits nicely in the \u2018I Need That\u2019 cabinet and some goes in the \u2018Not So Much\u2019 drawer. I admire your \u201cprolificity.\u201d How you do all the things you do and write as much as you do makes me wonder if you ever take time to, oh, I don\u2019t know\u2026sleep? I have two blogs. One of them is specific to my own relatively new pasttime of genealogy. In it, I describe what I find, the brick walls I have encountered, and other things related to my family tree. (http://www.wilkinsongenealogy.info) The other, https://denalidad.blogspot.com, is a blog I started just to write down those random thoughts I sometime think should be written down. I increase its size sporadically and often start things I do not finish. I started writing something longer than a blog post a year or so ago, but I have no idea what to do with it, so it stays in draft form, unpublished and visible only to me. And that is my issue. Since I am not motivated to \u201cbecome a writer,\u201d neither of my blogs is monetized nor will I seek to make money from them. Mostly, I write for me, though I hope the information in my genealogy blog is useful/helpful to other novice genealogists. My lack of reason\u200a\u2014\u200aif that is what it is\u200a\u2014\u200aseems to have been more of a \u201cperchance to succeed\u201d process than anything else. I am retired and stay busy doing all kinds of things; blogging, working on growing my own family tree and beta testing online commercial genealogy sites, and so on. It is why I read your words. I seek those tidbits of information that can grow into knowledge that will become action for me. I feel the need for direction, though I do not know what that means for me. I want \u201cto do something\u201d and have no real clear path on how to get there. I am not sure I even see the path. So, I am happy to be one of the 100,000 to meet your own goal and appreciate you writing for whatever reason you write. One day, I might finish that \u201cthing\u201d in my mind and will publish it somewhere, perhaps Medium. Or not. The tidbits are there; I will keep looking. Thank you.
