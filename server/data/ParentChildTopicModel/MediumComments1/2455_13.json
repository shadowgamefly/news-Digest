{"content": "I dont believe a LOT of this; the whole idea of I was taking a walk today has NOTHING to do with dissing on the Olympic medalist. It\u2019s a hypothetical situation that is realistically true. It\u2019s plausible that it could happen. IN fact, it\u2019s not the single line that says it all; it\u2019s the story he tells. Get your facts straight \u201cthe ringer\u201d. Some of these are the FARTHEST stretches I\u2019ve ever seen in terms of dissing. Kendrick isn\u2019t necessarily out to diss on some rappers. Don\u2019t get me wrong he will throw some real shade at rappers like in element. WHICH YOU GUYS STILL GOT WRONG. He was most likely dissing on a current rapper/ hip hop artist that he feels is a p**** *** *****\u00a0. Some things Kendrick raps about are more political/civil issues, true stories, what his life is like, and how he feels. I should hope this was for kicks because, if not, this could fool a lot of people. ", "child": "", "name": "2455_13", "parent": "2455", "title": ""}
