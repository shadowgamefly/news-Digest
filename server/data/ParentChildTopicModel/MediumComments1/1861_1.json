{"content": "Hey\u2026 There is something to being naive and an \u2018uncarved block\u2019 in The Way of Pu Bear\u2026 Innocence (relative un-jaded worldly-ness) is underrated. Resonating your light-bearing-ness is as it goes\u2026 Those that can benefit will eventually find you\u2026 without manipulations. Not that that is wrong, it\u2019s just another way. I often feel there must be a sheer ocean of numbers of contributors here, that I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of discovering. I lament a bit to not having the time (as seems do others have), even to keep up with all those I do admire and have interacted with from time to time. Make no mistake, it all comes around\u2026* I am not even here as much as I am inspired to be, but that just makes the times that I am all the more precious. There was a time on Medium, where there were complaints of the quality of writing. Perhaps that is/was true. Perhaps I number as one of them. (Not fishing for compliments\u2026) I thought this was rather presumptuous because one can follow and recommend whomever they choose\u2026 simple. Those posts seem to get crowds of agreement\u2026 Was it because they were \u2018well-written\u2019 or because they were written by friends, or because the content\u200a\u2014\u200athe subject itself was so titillating? Does it matter? I say \u2018do your thing\u2019 and get on with it\u2026 Keep it movin\u2019\u2026* The other thing is, what is often called click bait, can include the topics of the day\u2026 especially those subjects concerning our heated political issues\u2026 they are important to be aware of, but the over lingering hyper-focus of the (usual?) negative perspectives is overwhelming. It would be helpful if there were more instructive suggestions for constructive solutions. It would be helpful to see insights to positive alternative perspectives in general. The energy building behind the negative(s) makes much more of it\u2026 BHD, keep doing what you do, as you do that so well, somehow I found you out of the sheer ocean of numbers, and that counts to me.* ", "child": "", "name": "1861_1", "parent": "1861", "title": ""}
