{"content": "Chris Paul, the greatest point guard of his generation and also one of the greatest point guards of all time.. I\u2019m sorry, Shea. I\u2019m not rolling. CP3 is probably the most overrated player of his generation: he is a 50-Greatest talent, but because he plays PG, and nobody expects PG\u2019s to actually win you championships, there has never been the level of pressure placed on him that has been placed on other great players, like LeBron and KD (and even, to lesser extent, Melo). For instance, he\u2019s never guided a team outside the 2nd rd of the playoffs, and that\u2019s not his fault. He has constantly undermined the growth of his teammates (look at what has become of Blake Griffin), and that\u2019s not his fault, either.
