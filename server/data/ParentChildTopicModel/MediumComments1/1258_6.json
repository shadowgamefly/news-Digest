{"content": "This is an area I happened to have looked into. The \u2018Many Worlds\u2019 interpretation of quantum theory came about to do away with the seeming probabilistic nature of quantum interactions, such as the double slit situation. Each branch, or world, is supposedly completely deterministic. You didn\u2019t mention this in your article. There is another problem with the probabilistic interpretation of quantum-entity behavior. The probabilities are so incredibly stable it is hard to believe they are the result of ontological (true) randomness, despite the law of large numbers. This fact leads many physicists to maintain there are hidden variables at some lower level. Einstein maintained this, David Bohm wrote extensively about it, and while it is a minority position, more philosophical physicists maintain that whether the universe is probabilistic or not is still an open question.
