{"content": "If I recall correctly a judge found these subsidizing payments unConstitutional and its still in the court system. Am I incorrect on this? While I do not desire to create any hardship on people especially in the medical arena, people need to pay their own way. We need to figure out how people do that or a designated charity program that accomplishes this on their behalf. However stealing from some individuals to give to others is not how government should work. The Government should only use tax money to pay for things that directly or potentially benefit ALL citizens. If it benefits certain citizens, it should be segregated and discussed as a specific budget item of altruistic nature. ", "child": "", "name": "1072_6", "parent": "1072", "title": ""}
