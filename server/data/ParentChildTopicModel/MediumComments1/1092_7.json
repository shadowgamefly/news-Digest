{"content": "Every human organization operates on a Bell Curve. A few people overachieve and contribute heavily; the vast majority carry their own weight; and a small percentage underachieve and contribute little. I\u2019m always fascinated how the Republican Party and my Republican friends are so rigidly lasered in on that 5 percent of underachievers when crafting or considering legislation. They literally will scrap legislation that greatly benefits the 95% if an undeserved nickel goes to the 5%. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s true? The original AHCA paper was 60 pages long. Six pages (10%) of the document were directed to keeping lottery winners from drawing AHCA funds. Across the country, that\u2019s maybe 50 individuals who beat one in millions odds to win a national or state lottery and that requires 10% of the AHCA document to make sure these people don\u2019t get a dime? Fifty people out of tens of millions who need financial assistance to afford insurance won\u2019t even be a drop from a drop from a drop in a bucket in additional costs, yet the Republicans are more concerned about these 50 people getting an \u201cundeserved\u201d benefit than the tens of millions who need the benefit. Drug testing, work requirements, all this stuff to make sure the undeserving are weeded out despite all evidence that the vast majority of people receiving benefits are working and aren\u2019t drug users. Hard to believe but Republicans are more suspicious of Americans than they are of foreigners. ", "child": "", "name": "1092_7", "parent": "1092", "title": ""}
