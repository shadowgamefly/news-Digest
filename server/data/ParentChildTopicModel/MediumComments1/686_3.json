{"content": "Great story, Felicia, very reminiscent of Ray Bradbury. Some wonderful lines like: \u201c We pictured an existence free of Republicans, Christian fundamentalists, global warming, telemarketers, reality TV shows, eyeliner, stamps, parking tickets, kale, and junk mail.\u201d The inclusion of kale is perfect. A frightening forecast, all in all, but very possible and ultimately devastating whatever the outcome (whether we keep our eyes or not!) Really enjoyed this. You should also put in in Literati Magazine. Ren\u00e9e (publisher) would love this too! ", "child": "", "name": "686_3", "parent": "686", "title": ""}
