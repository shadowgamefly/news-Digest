{"content": "One not well reported example of this happened within the management of MeetUp.com Soon After Trump was elected, MeetUp decided to set up more than a thousand free #resist groups all across the country, heavily advertised it, and facilitated the resist movement by allowing access to every MeetUp member. While it\u2019s their business and they\u2019re entitled to manage it as they please, I found the whole process stretched ethical boundaries quite a bit, and that on top of the insanity of such an in your face stand against half their potential US customers. Personally I know better than to discuss politics at work. These days that can get you targeted for isolation and termination. Just look at Brendan Eich. He donated $$ to Prop 8 in California in 2008, a motion that passed with a clear majority. After activists mined the donation lists for political targets, Eich was harassed and forced to step down from the company he founded, Mozilla. Interestingly Obama and Hillary Clinton neither publicly supported Gay marriage until the middle of 2012, four years after the donation which got Eich ousted. The Huffington Post published links to the names of all the donors in 2009. Several average people lost their jobs and several small businesses were forced to close. In 2014, Slate magazine ran an article saying lets oust ANYONE who donated money to Prop 8. Progressives have openly declared war against anyone who opposes them. Heck, some on theleft have called for reeducation camps, or, as Bill Ayers said, we should simply exterminate about 25,000,000 of them. ", "child": "", "name": "917_1", "parent": "917", "title": ""}
