{"content": "That doesn\u2019t work for poetry. Very few publications will pay you, even quite a few established, name publications. I have published quite a few poems in them and always got paid in hassle and honor. That\u2019s just how poetry works. I accept it. But if I wrote non-fiction prose, articles, etc., I wouldn\u2019t do it for free unless I was just starting out. Too much effort. I think the sheer volume of free writing on the Internet has destroyed the market. Publications/platforms now assume you will be happy to write for free. That\u2019s wrong. Thanks.
