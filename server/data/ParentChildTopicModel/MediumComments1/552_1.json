{"content": "To her everlasting credit, Elizabeth has different ideas. She hasn\u2019t had a lot of sex in her life, and even less great sex, but as she enters her 30s, is pretty damn clear that tremendous chemistry is out there waiting for her. Waiting with someone else.\n \n Fourteen months into our marriage, Elizabeth asks for a divorce. I try to argue. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for you too,\u201d she say. \u201cI deserve a man whose clothes I want to rip off. And you deserve a woman who gets wet when she looks at you.\u201d\n \n There is no arguing with that.\n \n One night, shortly before I move out for good, I ask Elizabeth if she is sorry we\u2019d stopped having sex before we were married. She thinks for a moment. \n \n \u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cI really wish you hadn\u2019t told me we could wait.\u201d \n \n I nod. I don\u2019t need to ask why. Elizabeth smiles. \u201cBut it was so sweet of you to try,\u201d she adds.\n \n I will never underestimate the centrality of chemistry again.", "child": "", "name": "552_1", "parent": "552", "title": ""}
