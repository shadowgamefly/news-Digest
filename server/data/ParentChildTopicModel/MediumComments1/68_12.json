{"content": "The Cavs added a lot of relevant players during the season. Aside from Bogut, none of them are plus-defenders, including JR Smith, who is returning to form. I don\u2019t see reason to panick. The Raptors and Wizards represent strong challegers, and Boston might have home court advantage, and even then, the field seems very favorable for Cleveland. Miami and Detroit are cream puffs. Chicago has proud players, and might challenge the Cavs a little (just like those old Carmelo-led Knicks teams, that would steal one or two games in the playoffs). It\u2019s interesting to notice that besides changing so much from last year, neither the Cavs nor the Warriors are showing anything new at this point of the season. Durant is recovering from an injury and Cleveland is experimenting with lineups. ", "child": "", "name": "68_12", "parent": "68", "title": ""}
