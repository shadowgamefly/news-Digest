{"content": "I\u2019d like to see a 017 version of this. Relevant to Trump of course\u200a\u2014\u200aand such \u201cleaders\u201d as Mitch McConnell. The sheer pity of this is that resources are being allocated to coal companies (part of Trump\u2019s making America great again plan), but only by not funding those institutions that can give miners an alternative. I mean specifically education, but other services apply. Trump has promised jobs for miners who are now under-employed because of environmental regulations. But that\u2019s like promising people a death sentence. He is in effect condemning people to work in the mines\u200a\u2014\u200athe Romans and Soviet Russia did the same, but to criminals. The money now being directed to coal and other fossil energy cos. could be spent on education and other services to create a better life for miners. We know that Appalachia\u200a\u2014\u200acertain parts anyway\u200a\u2014\u200ahave some of the highest incidences of cancer in the country\u200a\u2014\u200anot from people being in mines but because of residual issues. The miners working conditions add to that. ", "child": "", "name": "2485_4", "parent": "2485", "title": ""}
