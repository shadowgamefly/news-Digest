{"content": "What\u2019s wrong with the NFL\u00a0today The Levi\u2019s Stadium\u00a0example  The debacle of Levi\u2019s Stadium is a prime example of why the NFL is in a death spiral. The Hit Job wrote about this in early October: Who can afford to go to an NFL game anymore? I\u2019ll tell you someone who can\u2019t: me. Is it because I\u2019m poor? In the eyes of the NFL, I guess I am. In actuality, between my wife and I we gross about a quarter of a million dollars a year. Do you know what is at the top of our list of things we cannot afford? NFL game tickets. And I\u2019m not some casual fan. It\u2019s not just as simple as the cost/benefit analysis we and millions of other football followers make. The NFL, through its escalating costs, has irreversibly altered the core of its fans that can attend its games. Ask the Bay Area 49ers fans who used to be able to afford the occasional ticket to Candlestick, but now can only watch their (currently hapless) team on TV. The new stadium in Santa Clara is very nice. It\u2019s also mostly populated by the rich Silicon Valley tech winners\u00a0\u2026 and fans of opposing teams. That\u2019s right. The astronomical expense of season tickets plus personal seat licenses for your NFL team\u2019s home games demand that you resell some, if not most, of your tickets to recoup your outlay. To do that, you\u2019re going to sell to the highest bidder. Often, that\u2019s fans of visiting teams. It\u2019s not just in San Francisco, either. Ask the New York Giants & Jets fans how they afford their tickets to Metlife Stadium. Ditto for Cowboys fans at AT&T Stadium. And soon to be shaking down Los Angeles area fans for Stan Kroenke\u2019s new stadium palace. Go to a Seattle Seahawks game at CenturyLink Field. If you can afford it. When I lived in the Seattle area, I attended several (years ago). One time, I went to a game courtesy of a friend\u2019s season tickets. He barely cares about the Seahawks. Or team sports in general. But he\u2019s got season tickets because he\u2019s a partner in a local law firm. They buy the tix to treat important clients or occasionally reward employees. Those are your fans, NFL. The die-hards are dying off, because your hand is on their back pushing them out the door. But the looky-loos will show up, when gifted. So there you have it. Today\u2019s NFL stadium attendee mix is made up mostly of the wealthy (who probably do not live & die by their team\u2019s fortunes) and the die-hard followers of your opponents. Loyalty, schmoyalty. The NFL traded it for filthy lucre. For now. Google \u201cLevi\u2019s stadium half empty\u201d and you\u2019ll see a list of articles detailing the lack of attendance at most of the 49ers\u2019 home games since the debut of the venue in 2014. How long can the 49ers and the NFL keep that up?
