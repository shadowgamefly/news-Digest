{"content": "No! God, no! F*** no!!! We read articles from sportswriters because we want to read about sports. It\u2019s a terrible feeling when you wake up, make some coffee, get online to read some basketball or football stories, and instead you get a political diatribe. Whether the writer is in line with your own views or not, people don\u2019t want their sports fix hijacked by political opinion. Just read the comment section of ANY article on this half-assed red-headed stepchild of Grantland. This particular site is one of the most egregious offenders of \u201cSuper Bowl coverage? Nah, we need more one-sided political commentary.\u201d ", "child": "", "name": "266_9", "parent": "266", "title": ""}
