{"content": "Hi Steve, I was reading up on astroids and the curve I called a parabola is definitely not an astroid. According to this website, you get an astroid when the straight lines forming the curve all have the same length: Envelope - Math ImagesThis is a beautiful blue-aerial-shell firework filling the sky. Each particle of the firework follows a parabolic\u2026mathforum.org The black lines form the curve I called a parabola. The red lines form an\u00a0astroid. Just to confirm this, according to Wikipedia, the equation of an astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 when the x- and y-intercepts are 1. Astroid - WikipediaAn astroid is a particular mathematical curve: a hypocycloid with four cusps. Specifically, it is the locus of a point\u2026en.wikipedia.org The black lines form the curve I called a parabola. The red curve is an\u00a0astroid. I can\u2019t prove the curve is a parabola, but a parabola whose line of symmetry is y = x and whose x- and y-intercepts are 1 is y = x + 1 \u00b1 (4x)^(1/2). The black lines form the curve I called a parabola. The red curve is a parabola. In case you are wondering, the parabola\u2019s vertex is at (0.25, 0.25), its focus is at (0.5, 0.5), and the equation of its directrix is y = -x, which all fits.
