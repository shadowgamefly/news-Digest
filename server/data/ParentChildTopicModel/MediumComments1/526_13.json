{"content": "Mayor, thanks for the poignant thoughts and reflections about the state of things in Africa and Christianity. It would appear it\u2019s more widespread than many of us imagine, albeit China seems to be the one place where that\u2019s not as much of the case due to widespread persecution. That\u2019s the thing about Christianity, if you want to see it grow rapidly and in it\u2019s original form, take it somewhere where people are truly persecuted (not this American crap people espouse\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI\u2019m being persecuted because I spoke out!\u201d No, you ran your mouth like a jerk.). Once that happens, it thrives. Thanks for those great words and getting to the heart of the Gospel: someone loved us first \u201cwithout conditions, requirements or condemnation\u201d and we\u2019re to do the same.
