{"content": "A few years ago, on a professional association group discussion, I posted an article, the title of which had the words \u201cangry white men\u201d. The response, without reading the article\u00a0.. from white men\u00a0.. was that I was being racist, sexist, etc. My post simply was the title of the article and something like \u201cInteresting reading.\u201d Nothing more. The brouhaha continued and people called the (white male) CEO of the association to complain. I don\u2019t get it. In that case or this. What is the fear of being called out when women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and many others have been \u2018called out\u2019 for just being who we are for\u00a0.. ever? And why do I expect better of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d? ", "child": "", "name": "532_14", "parent": "532", "title": ""}
