We learn this at a fairly young age, and it\u2019s reinforced throughout our lives through a number of different avenues (like this one, and these ones). We have to be better than our male counterparts in order to be considered/perceived even close to equal to them, and we frequently don\u2019t get the same kind of encouragement to pursue \u201cmale\u201d subjects (the response that uses a golf analogy is pretty spot-on). Then, you get the girl who\u2019s not only good at programming, but finds it comes pretty easy to her. Her challenge comes from pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s taught in the core of the class. Since there\u2019s that ingrained \u201cSTEM is hard for girls,\u201d she then thinks that because it\u2019s easy for her, it must be easy for everyone, which is then reinforced by the fact that the guys were building robots (an arguably more nerdy and \u201cgeeky cool\u201d thing than HTML/CSS) when she was tinkering with HTML, which also has historically had the stigma of \u201cnot real programming,\u201d since it\u2019s a declarative language. While, individually, most of these things should be easy to brush off, in aggregate, they add up and erode a girl\u2019s confidence in their ability and their potential, and they\u2019re often left to their own devices to muscle through it. Some of us love the craft so much that we simply don\u2019t care what other people think (though the spectre of imposter syndrome is still there, and I\u2019m not sure the fear of not being good enough to keep one\u2019s job ever really goes away, but it\u2019s definitely more easily pushed aside for some of us than others)\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what we live for. We\u2019d be pretty lost if we couldn\u2019t, and we can\u2019t fathom doing anything else (unless, or sometimes even if, civilization collapsed entirely). However, we don\u2019t all have that luxury, and the imposter syndrome overwhelms us, because there is no countering force to tell us \u201cthat imposter syndrome is bullshit, you\u2019re an awesome coder, keep going!\u201d ", "child": "", "name": "850_14", "parent": "850", "title": ""}
