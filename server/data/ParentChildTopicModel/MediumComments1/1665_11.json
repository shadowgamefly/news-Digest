{"content": "For everyone wondering how Ohio State and Washington made it in and Penn State and Oklahoma and whatever other teams got left out, I figured out the mysterious criteria that the committee used to pick the teams: LOSE FEWER GAMES THAN THE OTHER GUYS. EVERY power 5 team with 1 or fewer loss made the playoff. ALL of them. Not one power 5 team with 1 loss or no losses was snubbed or overlooked or screwed in some way. Every other power 5 team in the entire country that is not in the playoff lost two or more times. You want to make the playoffs, don\u2019t lose more times than 4 other teams.
