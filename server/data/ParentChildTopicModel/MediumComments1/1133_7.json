{"content": "I guess if you have discipline, credit and a good paying job it would make sense to borrow $100,000 and invest it in the stock market or a diversified portfolio of high yield securities where you reinvest the income. Given enough time the original debt would be paid off and the portfolio should double every ten to twelve years. So, if you could do this at 30 and pay off the original loan by 50, at retirement age of 65 the $100,000 could turn into around $800,000. You could accomplish the same by taking a cash-out refinance on your home equity and do the same. But beware if you lose your job or there is a major market downturn.
