{"content": "\u201cDid Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate? Just asking!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aTrumpTweet during wee hours of April 3 OK. Once more. There are no \u201canswers\u201d to give in a debate. It\u2019s not an exam. There are questions, to which participants give responses (which may be factual or not), and those responses are generally fact-checked by various media. What Hillary received were QUESTIONS believed to be planned for debates she was going to participate in. Two of them. One having to do with the death penalty, and the other having to do with the drinking water in Flint (for a debate taking place in Flint). Even Hillary\u2019s detractors acknowledge that she\u2019s a lady who does her homework. Is there anyone out there on God\u2019s green earth who doubts that Hillary would already have had a stock answer regarding the death penalty, or doubts that she would have researched out and be prepared to talk intelligently about Flint\u2019s water problems for a debate in Flint (where the water problems were sure to be the number one issue)? Hillary didn\u2019t need to know either of these questions in advance, and receiving them would not have altered her debate performance in either case. Why would she need to \u201capologize\u201d for receiving something she neither solicited nor needed? We don\u2019t even have evidence that she actually read these supposedly damning emails. That said\u200a\u2014\u200aTrump needs to find some less obvious irrelevant fluff to use as a red herring in a desperate attempt to distract the media and the public from the Russia matter. An issue that\u2019s closing in on him. And he\u2019s gotta be feeling the squeeze. ", "child": "", "name": "2189_7", "parent": "2189", "title": ""}
