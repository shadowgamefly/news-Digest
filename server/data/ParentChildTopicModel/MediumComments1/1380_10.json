{"content": "Larry: It\u2019s a good question, better put to people who write prose than poets. Poets don\u2019t expect to make money. TS Eliot was a bank clerk. Wallace Stevens was an insurance executive. WC Williams was a country doctor. But prose writers deserve better. They labor longer and harder.

Being expected to do it for free is just wrong. My two cents. ", "child": "", "name": "1380_10", "parent": "1380", "title": ""}
