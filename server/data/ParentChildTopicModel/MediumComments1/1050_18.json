{"content": "Great article and I am in the same boat. Older person, coming from PHP and I\u2019ve also decided to move to pure JavaScript and boy, did the opportunities for what I\u2019ve been working on the past couple of years with only very slow progress open up. Once you get past all the tooling stuff, you realize, these things are all there because people are solving technical problems. These are also problems any language has and the fact so many solutions are available so quickly with JS shows its true power as a language. I see the glass half full. You simply get shit done fast and yes, even faster than with PHP! (try coding JS without semicolons for a while too! = Real Fun!!!) The fact that you can do both front and back-ends in one language is a huge win. It simplifies the technology stack a lot, which also increases productivity. The future is along the lines of the JAM Stack! Another great JS programmer once wrote, it is \u201cfreedom\u201d that the JavaScript language offers. I like to think of it as \u201cawesome flexibility\u201d. And yes, that also means, a developer can easily and quickly build a bunch of crap too. But, that is ok. That is where experience and not (only) type systems like TypeScript or Flow can help, but aren\u2019t necessary. Again, flexibility! I am a JS convert. I\u2019ll only go back to other languages, when I get paid to. ", "child": "", "name": "1050_18", "parent": "1050", "title": ""}
