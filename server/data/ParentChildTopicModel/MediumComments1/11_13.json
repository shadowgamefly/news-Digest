{"content": "Biggest racist article I\u2019ve read in awhile. Imagine a white person writing about blacks, first it wouldn\u2019t be published, too racist. The writer is a complete ignorant fool who bases everything on race and basis it in a complete biased way. They continue to believe this great urban myth of \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d and base it on feelings not facts. They have never been inside of my skin but he perceives how I feel and what privilege I have. Foolish idiocy drives this belief and reason and uses it with the excuse of why their society as a whole has failed. That is why they will never get out of their social standing why as a society they will continue to fail. They continue to be their own worse enemy and too dumb to even realize it.
