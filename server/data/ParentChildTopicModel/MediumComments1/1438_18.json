{"content": "Enlightening. Informative. Thank you. My \u201cplatform\u201d, I guess, is Blogspot. I also have had some things published in \u201cMedium\u201d. \u201cVirality\u201d is the key, for sure. My brief experience is fraught with the curious, however. I am still unable to figure out how \u201cOperation Catnip & Julie Newmar, Star\u201d garnered nearly 600 \u201cviews\u201d in a matter of hours. IN POLAND\u2026 Posted 25th January 2016 by DILULIUS, King of Troy or\u2026 How another blog received nearly 300 \u201cviews\u201d in Russia in a day without acknowledgement of, which blog entry was, in fact viewed. I have neither particular Internet faculty nor natural inclination toward the electronic \u201carts\u201d. I just produce a blog often based upon alternative views of current events. I\u2019ll use your advise with an eye towards greater \u201cvirality\u201d. I\u2019ll take this opportunity to \u2018ask for a share\u2019. Thanks again.
