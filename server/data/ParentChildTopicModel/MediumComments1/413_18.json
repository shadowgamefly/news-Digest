{"content": "I wholeheartedly agree with you on your article with one exception: \u201c\u2026 is as irresponsible as trusting in God to fix the climate problem.\u201d I do beg to differ with you on that point only. As an American citizen would like to leave the country, come back to vote in 2018 elections, and get back out until things change (hopefully) in when I can vote again. Unfortunately I live in the \u201cmore than 135% less than the poverty level\u201d and have absolutely no means to leave. I sure would like to get out during the current administration. I always thought, like others, about the \u201cchecks and balances\u201d argument. I often told the \u201cTrump\u201d people who definitely wanted him as their President, about these \u201cchecks and balances\u201d and further, not all of his Executive Orders, may not pass muster (e.g. the travel ban). Additionally, I could agree with you more on the subject of climate change. Also, when I first heard \u201che\u201d proposed a cut to the office of the Secretary of State, I was convinced \u201che\u201d was extremely ill advised. At that point all the pundits said, and I agreed, in sync, \u201coh great, what if something really bad happens?\u201d And as we see, something has happened. On foreign affairs, however, I do have some hope in the generals he has surrounded himself with. Otherwise \u201che\u201d wouldn\u2019t have a clue what to do\u00a0. There are no other staff to inform him on foreign affairs. I thank you for an outstanding article. ", "child": "", "name": "413_18", "parent": "413", "title": ""}
