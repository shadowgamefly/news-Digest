{"content": "Sorry to burst your bubble sweetie. I believe that most people can comprehend that charities or organizations do not receive the full cost of merchandise unless it is so stated. Those who who buy Girl Scout cookies or school fundraiser wrapping paper don\u2019t think the full cost goes to that organization. You are the one being self righteous in implying that people who buy and display merchandise that support causes they believe in are, what did you say, oh yes, \u201cassholes\u201d. I live in the Deep South and to wear a tee shirt that says I support abortion rights usually means I will be called an \u201casshole\u201d only by the anti-abortion groups. I have ordered and wear message tee shirts to let others know my opinions and to promote my beliefs. I also donate to these causes and participate in events that advance their agenda. I am an advocate for anything that promotes those organizations, even if it is just wearing a tee shirt. Unlike your article, this is a way to send a positive message to those around you. Go get some coffee or something. ", "child": "", "name": "1747_1", "parent": "1747", "title": ""}
