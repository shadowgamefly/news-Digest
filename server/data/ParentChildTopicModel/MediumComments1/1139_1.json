{"content": "i used to do studies while i was in college! it was an easy way to make $1000. they were always fun though; new recliners and people can bring in their own game consoles. the food in our trial center was extremely terrible, but they did let you pick out food you didn\u2019t like (death to cucumbers!). i started watching the almighty johnsons during one of my last stays, which is still one of my favorites. our trial center also tested generics but after that awful painkiller trial in france they lowed way down and mainly did the steroid cream studies for a while. sometimes i miss being able to make quick money like that.
