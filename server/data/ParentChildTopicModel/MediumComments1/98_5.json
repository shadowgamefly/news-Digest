{"content": "I\u2019m not sure if this happens in other parts of the country, but in Texas people will just set up a bunch of carnival rides in a furniture store parking lot or whatever and have an insta-carnival for a weekend. Mostly it\u2019s midway games, but they also always have three or four actual serious rides; rides that, if everything goes the way it\u2019s supposed to go, then everything turns out OK, but if nuts and bolts and beams and shit start falling off because they weren\u2019t put together right or screwed down right, then someone could get seriously hurt. Playing against these teams is like riding one of those rides. You\u2019ll likely be fine, but there\u2019s a chance it can go horribly, horribly wrong.", "child": "", "name": "98_5", "parent": "98", "title": ""}
