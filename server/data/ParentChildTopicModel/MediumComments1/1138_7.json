{"content": "I worked for years to pull myself out of debt after my divorce. I know the pain and humiliation. My ex sounds a lot like yours. I am still paying, despite having all of the debt paid off because it\u2019s taking forever for my credit score to come up. I\u2019m trying to purchase a home for myself, but despite having no credit card debt, and no collections, I can\u2019t seem to get approved for a mortgage.\u00a0I will never trust a man enough to surrender my finances or career ever again. I don\u2019t mean to sound bitter, but this rebuilding has been far too painful and costly for me. ", "child": "", "name": "1138_7", "parent": "1138", "title": ""}
