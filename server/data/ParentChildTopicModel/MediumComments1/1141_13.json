{"content": "I suppose the DB could be more generous to account for double taxation\u2026 but I\u2018m a bit confused about the statement quoted above. The tax withholding should have no net effect on the total amount of taxes\u2026 When you file your tax return anything extra would be refunded and anything under would be payable. (In theory, if they know you\u2019re going to be taxed on the contributions, they would withhold the same amount that they would on regular income. If the contributions were going to be tax deferred (apparently not in this case) then they would reduce the withheld taxes.) Feel free to not respond if this isn\u2019t helpful\u2026 If you\u2019re absolutely clear on what\u2019s happening then I don\u2019t want you to spend your time explaining American taxation to a Canadian taxpayer!!
