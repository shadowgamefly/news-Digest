{"content": "Thanks for the interesting.\u00a0.\u00a0. thoughts, Darius. You\u2019ve made some pretty good points here about the importance of living your life as opposed to ruminating about your life. One thing I worry about\u200a\u2014\u200abeing something of a pedant\u200a\u2014\u200ais that statistic you keep using throughout. That 99% of thoughts are useless. Nowhere do you state where you got that information. To my mind, you\u2019re using that statistic as an exaggerated effect to point out the effort we waste ruminating over our thoughts. However, it bugs me that you never mention that you\u2019ve either made it up or you took it from some respected authority so you can appeal to her knowledge as the basis for your claim. Possibly thinking about this too much, but, to me, it brings down what had been a well-written guide to a better life. ", "child": "", "name": "212_24", "parent": "212", "title": ""}
