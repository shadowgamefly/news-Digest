{"content": "Laughable. See WaPo: In a Thursday letter to Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son now overseeing the hotel, the project\u2019s contracting officer found the company met the terms of the lease because the president had resigned from a formal position with the company and the organization had restructured an internal operating agreement so he received no direct proceeds from the D.C. hotel business while in office. \u201cIn other words, during his term in office, the president will not receive any distributions from the trust that would have been generated from the hotel,\u201d said the contracting officer, Kevin M. Terry. Terry also praised the project for turning a partly empty government office building into a hotel that had already generated $5.1 million for the government by the time it opened in the fall. \u201cThus the lease turned a building that had been costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year into a revenue-generating asset,\u201d Terry wrote. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2017/03/23/federal-agency-rules-trumps-d-c-hotel-lease-in-full-compliance/ ", "child": "", "name": "459_1", "parent": "459", "title": ""}
