Since you bring up higher education, and an apparent trending fear therein having something to do with fascism, etc, I just wanted to point you to some resources, and you can make of them what you will. But they have something to do, in my opinion, with why I don\u2019t think either immigrants nor college girls have anything to worry about, in terms of who might be the ones targeted for systematic repression by some kind of regime. And maybe in some small part, why the urgency of not allowing a Democratic regime to retain the White House and the executive branch was so severe, that even a person like Trump became an obvious alternative: USA: Where does VAWA grant money GO? - antimisandry.comtemp_3854_1468110637296_457 It's not an easy question to answer, as the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) doesn\u2026www.antimisandry.com VAWA Fraud: Portrait in CATASTROPHIC FAILUREAs some readers may know, I have been monitoring the Justice Department\u2019s audit reports on recipients of Violence\u2026medium.com Meet Jane Crow: VAWA is SEGREGATIONPublished on Jim Crow, meet Jane Crow.

I say, take it with as much salt as you need to (and yes, I am the author of all of it but not of all the linked materials within the items), and draw your own conclusions. And by all means, look deeper and further than I have thus far, especially given your concerns over your daughter in college. My conclusion, which I drew from the process of putting all this together over 4\u20135 years\u2019 time, is that the Obama presidency was a running anti-Constitutional coup d\u2019etat directly targeting the Bill of Rights in order to destroy it by abusing it, by means of nationalizing both the education and domestic violence intervention sectors; and in the longer term, by means of Title IX/Dear Colleague, merging the two, and creating a new Democrat-targeted class of untermenschen: Men.
