{"content": "Ted, this is beautiful. I remember your dad, and how he was in Beijing. That picture of him reading the Thai newspaper isn\u2019t all that different from how I remember him. Both my parents have passed now, and it is a curious feeling, being unmoored from the people who made me. I was with them both when they died, and in a weird way it felt like the most ordinary thing in the world. I\u2019m so glad you got to be with your dad, who helped you become your best self, and wanted for your children what he\u2019d wanted for you. Enjoy the time with your mom, and take care.
