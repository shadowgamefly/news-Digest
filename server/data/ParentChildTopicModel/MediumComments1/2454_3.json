Your brain can\u2019t remember all those weights, and even if it could, it couldn\u2019t then perform the calculation that resulted in the next state of the neural network. And even if it could, you would have learned nothing about how to play Go, or, in truth, how AlphaGo plays Go\u2014just as internalizing a schematic of the neural states of a human player would not constitute understanding how she came to make any particular move.", "child": "", "name": "2454_3", "parent": "2454", "title": ""}
