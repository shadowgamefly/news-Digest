{"content": "Sharing can include splitting expenses As someone building an authentic carpooling system, I\u2019ve watched the Uber/Lyft space closely. I don\u2019t think a monetary transaction makes something commercial, it\u2019s defined by intent and the level of compensation.Two people can meet and share a meal\u200a\u2014\u200awe accurately use sharing for that. If one paid for the ingredients and they split the cost, that\u2019s also sharing. We wouldn\u2019t call a money exchange to chip-in for ingredients a commercial activity because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s sharing an expense. Monetary exchange itself does not define the activity, it\u2019s defined by intent. Is the chef cooking as a business? This is easy to tell. The same logic applies to driving.\u00a0Uber has always been a commercial \u201cfor-hire\u201d service. In terms of the driver\u2019s relationships with the rider, that never should have been called ride-sharing. The driver\u2019s intent is to earn money providing rides. Lyft and Uber used the term ride-sharing because it allowed them to skirt the rules when they launched. For-hire driving by someone other than a taxi or limo was illegal at that time. UberPool and LyftLine do involve some sharing of space by riders but the driver\u2019s role is still strickly commercial.\u00a0At Carzac we are building an authentic carpool system. We calculate the true cost of driving and give riders a simple way to chip-in on that expense. Carpools like these where the driver and rider share the cost of driving are not commericial. They are more like two people sharing the cost of a meal or an apartment they rent together. If the driver is driving there anyways and the rider helps pay the cost, that\u2019s just being fair to both parties. It\u2019s legal in all cases, non-commercial, and should be considered authentic sharing. ", "child": "", "name": "1375_15", "parent": "1375", "title": ""}
