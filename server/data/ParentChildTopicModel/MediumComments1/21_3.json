{"content": "Remember that your perception of your own body is shaped by a culture that hates fat wherever it appears. There is no telling a fatter friend that I hate the way I look, but it\u2019s fine for you. There is no safe haven of hating your body that doesn\u2019t also rely on logic that marginalizes mine. If you hate the fat on your body, that will color your perception of mine. Like any virus, you do not get to decide that you are resistant. You do not get to decide whether it is communicable. Do not transmit the virus back to your fat friend.", "child": "", "name": "21_3", "parent": "21", "title": ""}
