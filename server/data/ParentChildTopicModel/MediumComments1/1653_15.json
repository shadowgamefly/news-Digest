{"content": "Just my opinion, but it looks like Alabama won\u2019t be playing anybody all year. We\u2019ll at least anybody who can establish a run game, or anybody who can last four quarters of physical football. The only team that can beat Alabama, and this statement has proven true for three years now, is Alabama. It\u2019s going to take a mistake free performance against a mistake plagued Alabama team. I would like to see Washington win it all because I\u2019m a fan of the underdog, even as an Alabama fan. I just don\u2019t see them holding up. Ohio State doesn\u2019t impress me at all, and Clemson isn\u2019t the team they were last year. Nevertheless let the games begin. ", "child": "", "name": "1653_15", "parent": "1653", "title": ""}
