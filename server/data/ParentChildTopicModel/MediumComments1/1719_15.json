Escalators, bridges, balconies, airplanes, confined spaces, being the center of attention - all became torture for me. After 30 days sober, I noticed a significant difference. Now 5 years sober and I know that never want to feel that way ever again. ", "child": "", "name": "1719_15", "parent": "1719", "title": ""}
