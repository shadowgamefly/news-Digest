{"content": "If your underpayment is below a certain threshold (related to how much was withheld vs. last year\u2019s tax bill vs. how much you owe), there are no penalties. And, unofficially, if the total amount of penalties is below a certain threshold (I think it\u2019s $10), the feds have some sense and they realize there\u2019s no point in going through the trouble of sending out such a small bill and processing your payment. (They actually sent me a letter last year stating I underpaid, but with an amount due of $0 because my penalty was only $8.) I also find it rather friendly that there\u2019s no additional fee or penalty for having the IRS do all of those calculations for you. (As in, it doesn\u2019t cost you one dime extra if you let the IRS calculate the penalties and interest.) ", "child": "", "name": "184_2", "parent": "184", "title": ""}
