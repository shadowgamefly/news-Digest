{"content": "@Mauricio Estrella I have been thinking for the last couple of days and am just collating studies / research about the power of positive phrase passwords. My question I had was; Would staff be more productive, have less sick days and be more engaged if the password to your computer was a motivational phrase rather than Summer2014. Would a group of people, who work in the same area\u200a\u2014\u200awho deliver consistent outcome work (devs etc) to test a theory its all part of science\u200a\u2014\u200anobody will know until tested\u200a\u2014\u200ain a certain environment. If you had a motivational password like YouMattert0peopl3todayandforever! Vs Welcome1 Which do you think that person would have a positive affirmation towards their self? Your article is a great story and proof point for harnessing the power of affirmation in a constant basis\u200a\u2014\u200awhat is more repetitive than putting your password into your work computer\u00a0? not much right- and its friction you have to be conscious of while putting it in\u200a\u2014\u200aor else you get the dreadful incorrect password\u00a0. So thank you for sharing this! Cheers Mark ", "child": "", "name": "605_10", "parent": "605", "title": ""}
