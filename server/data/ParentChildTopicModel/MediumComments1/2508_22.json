{"content": "To conclude cryptocurrency maximalism based on \u201cnetwork effects\u201d represented by an immature state of technology would be foolish. When it comes to value exchange, there may indeed be a supremacy, but confusing this with maximalism symbolized by market cap would be myopic to say the least. For example, Ripple may indeed end up have trillions of dollars in volume as a result of those whom it shares company, but it would be unlikely that this would translate as a consumer option for value exchange. The same can be said for Bitcoin, which has two philosophies that are in direct conflict of one another. Is Bitcoin digital-gold or digital-cash? When that question is answered there will be a vacuum. The scaling issues of Bitcoin are not the only issues, it consumes the energy of a small country and while energy is plentiful now, it will in coming years become a rare commodity, deprecating PoW on the grounds of practicality and basic cost-benefit economics. This will bring a wave of new algos, and also rekindle otherwise dismissed algos such as PoS and DPoS, which similarly incentivize while maintaining competing interests with far superior energy efficiency, transaction speeds and fees.
