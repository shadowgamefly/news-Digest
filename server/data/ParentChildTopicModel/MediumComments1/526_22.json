{"content": "That\u2019s a completely fair criticsm. I whole heartedly agree many non-religious and atheists do a better job than many Christians using their money, time, effort, and service to love people well. You don\u2019t have to be a Christian by any means to do that. However, I think you inferred I believe only Christians somehow have the monopoly on these attitudes and actions. The article is meant to be more of a critique against fellow \u201cChristians\u201d who refuse to follow the demands of their God and instead do more damage. It\u2019s a reminder that instead of political power grasps and cultural relevance, we have a much harder job to do simply loving others because our faith compels us to because our founder first loved us. When you begin to stray from that, you miss the heart of Jesus for others. All that said, you don\u2019t need God to be a kind and compassionate person. But if you call yourself a follower of Jesus, then it\u2019s not optional. ", "child": "", "name": "526_22", "parent": "526", "title": ""}
