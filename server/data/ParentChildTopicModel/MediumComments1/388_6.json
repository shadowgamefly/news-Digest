{"content": "I second the comment above. ^^ Also, it was a commenter on one of your previous Digit stories who persuaded me to send $30 to my savings account every week. It\u2019s free! It\u2019s automatic! And it\u2019s a comfortable amount that I chose and\u2026yeah, just do something like that, maybe? I looked at all the money-saving apps and it seems like a small automatic transfer is the way to go. It\u2019s a little supplement to the savings chunk that comes out of my paycheck twice a month. Also I just had a glass of ros\u00e9 at 10:30 with some bacon and I\u2019m feeling really great about my financial life, even though I just bought a cardigan and some shoes. Paying down $1,000 on our credit card this month thanks to an escrow refund from our home sale! Excited about that. Thankful that my husband and I have been REALLY lucky financially. Luck is 80% of financial security, I think. That\u2019s sad.\u00a0:( K I\u2019m going to crack a LaCroix. ", "child": "", "name": "388_6", "parent": "388", "title": ""}
