{"content": "I always thought that the \u201cevil one\u201d\u00a0, satan, whatever you want to call \u201cIT\u201d, would be a dashing figure, handsome, beguiling, wickedly good looking with a very enticing form of speech. The quintessential smooth talker who can get you to buy into anything he puts forward.

I am crushed. I thought I would recognize the diabolical one by the swathe and debonair stuff. Now I find out it is the moral and physical equivalent of a dump. Sad, very sad.
