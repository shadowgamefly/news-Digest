{"content": "Thanks, Benjamin, for putting so succinctly something I learned many years ago in \u201cWhat Color is Your Parachute\u201d. That book helped me look at my many life experiences and distill out what was really important to me. In my case, learning, writing, and explaining (or teaching). I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever fulfilled my ambitions perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200aor even adequately. But I know what I enjoy and I try to instill a little of that in everything I do. What was new to me (and equally important) was the concept of \u201cchoosing your inputs\u201d. Good food for thought. Thanks again. ", "child": "", "name": "1398_10", "parent": "1398", "title": ""}
