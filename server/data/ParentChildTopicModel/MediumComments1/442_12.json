{"content": "I have seen some strange wording by people \u2013 even those who dislike having illegal aliens in their country \u2013 to circle around this very issue. Phrases like \u201conly if an illegal alien breaks the law\u2026\u201d or \u201cI run a legitimate business that relies on illegal aliens\u201d show the general problem among U.S. citizens in acknowledging that someone in the country without permission is breaking the law and anyone knowingly employing, feeding or housing them is conspiring in that crime. As a law-abiding British citizen, I feel that I would be under greater scrutiny visiting the U.S.A. for a holiday than any of these criminals who steal into the nation without permission. The country seems content to dissuade me from vacationing there, while being OK with hordes of criminals living and working amongst them. Other countries have illegal immigrants, too. They treat them as the criminals they are. ", "child": "", "name": "442_12", "parent": "442", "title": ""}
