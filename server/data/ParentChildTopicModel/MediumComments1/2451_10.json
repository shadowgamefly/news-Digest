{"content": "I out-earn my husband, and he isn\u2019t bothered by that, but he is troubled by the feeling that he couldn\u2019t support a family without me. I get that. Nobody wants to feel trapped, or like their life doesn\u2019t entirely belong to them. Some part of it is the practical \u201cin case of disaster,\u201d which I can defray with life insurance, but some part of it is a sense of personal failure\u200a\u2014\u200ahis sense that he should be able to make enough money to live the classical middle class lifestyle (home, 2 kids, pet, retirement savings) by having a college degree and working 9\u20135 at a job where his presence is valued. That has led to soul-searching about whether he\u2019s in the right career, with the attendant nagging idea that if he\u2019s smart and talented and doing something useful, he\u2019d see confirmation of that in his paycheck, and since he isn\u2019t he must not be. That\u2019s not the kind of worry that occurs to me, because as a woman, I just assume that nobody is going to pay me for most of the important stuff I do. That said, I think he\u2019d be troubled if I was making less than him, because I have a stronger resume, and he\u2019d be aggrieved by the structural discrimination.
