{"content": "I find it hard voting for anyone on the Warriors at this point. The Warriors won 73 games last season without Durant, they won 67 this year, and while Durant was healthy they were actually on a worse pace than last season in total wins. Further, while Durants on/off numbers were actually pretty good (much higher than Leonards and Hardens), they were below that of Curry and Green. So Durant was arguably not even the most important player on his own team. When you stack a team like the Warriors you essentially take those players out of MVP contention, but who cares, they are likely rolling to an NBA championship.
