{"content": "Mike Pence: A Christian Fascist Who\u2019s a Heartbeat Away from the U.S. Presidency November 21, 2016 | Revolution Newspaper | revcom.us The United States will now have a vice president who wants to ban all abortions, overturn laws barring discrimination against LGBT people, fully unleash the police to stop and frisk Black and other oppressed people, and carry out other extreme steps that will lead to horrible new leaps in repression. Mike Pence cites Bible verses to back up such ugly policy stands. He is a Christian fascist who will be #2 in the White House. One of Trump\u2019s sons reportedly said before the election that his father\u2019s vice president will be \u201cthe most powerful vice president in history,\u201d in charge of domestic and foreign policy while Trump concentrates on \u201cmaking America great.\u201d Trump\u2019s people denied the report\u200a\u2014\u200abut, in any case, Pence will wield enormous sway. He is already playing a major role, including choosing cabinet and other officials. He met top Republicans in the House of Representatives and told them to \u201cbuckle up\u201d to move quickly, making clear he\u2019ll play a leading role in pushing fascist laws through Congress. As writer Jeremy Scahill put it (in an article at TheIntercept.com), \u201cMike Pence will be the most powerful Christian supremacist in U.S. history.\u201d Pence is part of a Christian fascist movement that aims to impose on society a government, laws, and dominant morality based on strict interpretations of the Bible. According to a Slate.com article, when Pence was a congressman from Indiana, \u201cAides and other politicians often saw him reading his Bible, and Pence would cite specific verses to justify policy arguments. \u2018These have stood the test of time,\u2019 he told one staffer. \u2018They have eternal value.\u2019\u201d He made an anti-evolution speech on the floor of the House saying he believes in \u201cintelligent design\u201d (an unscientific claim that life is too complex to have evolved and must be the work of God) and arguing that it be taught in schools. Bob Avakian (BA) pointed out in his work The Truth About Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2026 And Why Clinton and the Democrats Are No Answer that these Christian fascists are \u201cpolitical leaders and forces who insist that \u2018traditional morality,\u2019 as embodied in the patriarchal family as well as \u2018right or wrong\u2019 patriotism\u200a\u2014\u200aand rationalized in terms of fundamentalist Christianity\u200a\u2014\u200amust be the basis for maintaining the cohesion and solidity of American capitalist society and the dominant position of imperial America in the world arena.\u201d As BA noted, \u201cThese people are deadly serious\u200a\u2014\u200aand they are very powerful.\u201d (This article came out at the time of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, but it remains very relevant to what is going on today.) As BA also pointed out, these Christian fascists do not, today, insist on fully carrying out \u201cbiblical truths\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, that gay people, adulterers, rebellious children, witches, and so on must be put to death. BA dug into what\u2019s behind this: Once again, the leading Christian fascists do not insist on applying these and many other biblical laws and commandments because, under present circumstances, it would not be politically expedient for them to do so\u200a\u2014\u200ait would be seen as barbarous by the great majority of people, even in bourgeois society, and it would actually undercut their political objectives.\u00a0\u2026 What they do is to set themselves up as the authorities, the \u201cinterpreters\u201d and the \u201carbiters\u201d of \u201cbiblical truth,\u201d who can and should decide, not only for themselves but for society as a whole, what in \u201cGod\u2019s absolute laws and commandments\u201d and \u201cabsolute moral principles\u201d can and must be applied and what must be ignored or explained away at any given time. This is why it is correct and necessary to identify them as theocrats: they do, in fact, seek a form of rule which is based on religious, and more specifically Christian, authority\u200a\u2014\u200aas represented by people like themselves\u200a\u2014\u200ain the service of the American capitalist-imperialist system. It is not necessary to be atheists, as we revolutionary communists are, in order to recognize the atrociously reactionary nature of such a political program and the need to vigorously oppose it. These theocrats are deadly serious about imposing their will on society. And now, a leading theocrat is a heartbeat away from the presidency, in a powerful place to push forward the overall Christian fascist agenda. Targeting the Right to\u00a0Abortion The forceful assertion of \u201ctraditional family values\u201d is central to what the Christian fascists are aiming for. And attempts to cut away at, and even eliminate, the right to abortion are at the spearhead of this. They want to overturn the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. Find out more about the revolution Find out about BA, the leader of the revolution Up to this point, a key part of the strategy of the anti-abortion movement has been to put increasingly severe restrictions on abortion state by state. As Indiana governor, Pence has been among those at the forefront of this. Earlier this year, Pence signed a law stuffed with all kinds of restrictions and requirements designed to make it even more difficult for women to get an abortion and for abortion providers to function. Under the cynical justification of protecting women\u2019s safety, the Indiana law, like similar ones in other states, required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital\u200a\u2014\u200aa medically unnecessary rule that is impossible for providers to meet. The law prohibited women to have an abortion for various reasons, including when tests show that the fetus will be born with Down\u2019s syndrome or other disabilities. It required that clinics bury or cremate aborted fetuses\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, to treat fetuses legally as actual persons, which they are not. These abortion restrictions are not about the health of women, \u201cto protect life,\u201d or any other falsehoods used as justification. The real objective is to tighten patriarchal control over women\u200a\u2014\u200ato turn women into nothing more than incubators and sexual playthings for men. That\u2019s why these anti-abortionists are also against access to birth control. Pence himself has been active in the efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, a major provider of birth control for women, especially poor women. The anti-abortion law Pence signed was stopped from going into effect by a federal judge. But now, Pence will be in place to charge ahead with the threat he made during the presidential campaign: \u201cWe\u2019ll see Roe v. Wade consigned to the ash heap of history where it belongs.\u201d Targeting LGBT\u00a0People Another major aspect of the Christian fascist push for \u201ctraditional family values\u201d is attacks on LGBT people. While in Congress, Pence voted against employment nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people, opposed same-sex marriage, and tried to block federal funding of HIV treatments to organizations that are supportive of gay people and require that it go only to organizations that \u201cprovide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\u201d As Indiana governor, Pence signed the so-called \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d (RFRA). The RFRA was intended, despite the transparent claims that it was about \u201creligious freedom,\u201d to shore up bigotry and prejudice against LGBT people and all kinds of oppression rooted in fundamentalist Christianity. The RFRA banned cities and towns from enacting laws that provide protection for LGBT people against discrimination. Pence and others were forced to step back a bit and amend the RFRA in the face of righteous protests. But the Christian fascists have hardly given up on their crusade against LGBT people as part of their overall ultra-reactionary program. More Reactionary Shit from\u00a0Pence Jeremy Scahill outlines other policies pushed by Pence that will mean even more murders by police and leaps in overall repression against Black and other oppressed people: \u201cHe has advocated greater militarization of the so-called war on drugs, including escalated military patrols. Pence denounced activists and others protesting recent police killings of unarmed African-Americans, charging they \u2018seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings.\u2019\u2026 Pence is a strong supporter of stop-and-frisk programs, which in New York were used overwhelmingly against people of color. \u2018It\u2019s on a constitutional footing,\u2019 said Pence.\u201d Scahill also lists some of Pence\u2019s positions on unleashing the overall repressive machinery of the U.S.: * He supported making the Patriot Act permanent and wants to ban the burning of the U.S. flag. * Pence does not believe federal law enforcement agencies should have to get a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Service Act) warrant to conduct domestic surveillance and voted against requiring any warrant for domestic wiretapping. Unlike Trump, Pence has not openly promoted torture. But when asked on CBS Face the Nation on November 20 whether he agreed with Republican Senator McCain\u2019s opposition to torture, Pence refused to rule it out, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a president who will never say what we\u2019ll never do.\u201d Trump and Pence\u00a0Together Pence is often portrayed in the mainstream media as more \u201cstable\u201d than Trump and a \u201cbridge to the establishment.\u201d Pence does have longstanding ties to the more \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans, including major financial backers like the Koch brothers and Erik Prince, founder of the Blackwater security firm, which has close ties to the U.S. military. What does it say about the illegitimacy of the entire political structure of the U.S. that a Christian fascist monster like this is considered an \u201cestablished\u201d figure? Pence and Trump may seem like an odd pairing\u200a\u2014\u200aa religious fundamentalist and a crude, leering reactionary sleazebag. What ties them together is their fascist program, their view that this is what is needed to keep things together for the capitalist-imperialists and \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Major powerful sections among the rulers of this society have, for decades, either built up or enabled the fascist forces that Trump and Pence represent. And now, these fascist forces are poised to take command of the state in the USA. ", "child": "", "name": "486_7", "parent": "486", "title": ""}
