{"content": "I agree\u2026Facebook might have copied Snapchat in the first place\u2026 wait, its not that simple. Facebook tried to acquire Snapchat because they saw a new form of content creation being born. As Snapchat declined Facebook\u2019s efforts, they just decided to put the same \u201ctype of content creation\u201d on their apps. So, of course everyone will say: copycat. The secret sauce here is not Snapchat it self, but it\u2019s main feature: \u201cstories\u201d. And I agree\u2026 we will see many other apps following the same path\u2026 wait and see! Eventually everyone will stop calling this and that a copycat\u2026 until (well!) some other Snapchat comes up with something totally new.
