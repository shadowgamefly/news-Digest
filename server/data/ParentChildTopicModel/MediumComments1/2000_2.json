{"content": "Mr. Mays, Relatively good reporting- especially good about Dalvin Cook. Let me say it. Leonard Fournette=BUST. I realize most serious football analysts would laugh at that opinion, but prior to the 2012 NFL draft most analysts would laugh if you said Trent Richardson would be a bust. He is a big man, with great straightline speed, and while this makes him an incredible athlete, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll make him a great NFL running back. Sort of as you imply by saying \u201cwhile a massive back who treats safeties like speed bumps is undeniably entertaining\u201d and I agree this looks so cool, frankly its not what makes a great NFL RB. People like Peyton Hillis did this well for a while. Simply, running around a defender, while it doesn\u2019t look as cool, is easier and more predictable than running physically through a defender. Similar to the Trent Richardson comparison,he may be a product of LSU\u2019s prolific running game, as the guy who replaced him in their bowl was just as good. Furthermore, his lack of explosion is extraordinarily concerning. To me agility, the ability to make people miss, and quickness are some of the most important skills for an RB, and these skills aren\u2019t too evident on tape, and his jump at the combine only confirms that he lacks explosion. He is compared to AP, but AP jumped nearly a foot higher. While I never want to take the combine seriously, his numbers combined with the tape, show this is just a big man who can run fast, but is not agile. What type of RB is he like? I can\u2019t think of a successful RB his size with such a lack of explosion. Are people really going to say he is like Legarette Blount? He may be. But is Legaratte Blunt worth a top 10 pick? Maybe I sound like Skip Bayless. Yet if you don\u2019t make predictions in sports, its not any fun! ", "child": "", "name": "2000_2", "parent": "2000", "title": ""}
