{"content": "Thanks for the kind words Chris! We are totally on the same wavelength when it comes to the applications and benefits of compounding. Investing is just one of the areas that it can be applied to. Trying to learn something new everyday, no matter how small or insignificant it is, is also an example of compounding and here too, the results are seen only after a significant interval of time. I would say that the benefits of reading can also be put as an example of compounding. Thanks for your comment and for broadening the playing field!
