{"content": "Great post and great thoughts as always Mr. Brautigam (I miss those talks). But I would like to highlight that one of the things that have impacted the current perception of Design Thinking is that in many companies it has been perceived as an intent to unbalance the triangle to the user dimension instead of looking for the balance of the three. As most companies were unbalanced to the technical or business dimensions\u200b, it was needed to highlight the user one. But in that effort, politics, opportunities and egos can lead people to perceive that now the user is the first important thing,\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0we\u00a0will\u00a0think\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0rest. For me humility and equilibrium are the keys to lead to a shift of paradigm. Thanks for your thoughts Bert! ", "child": "", "name": "1273_10", "parent": "1273", "title": ""}
