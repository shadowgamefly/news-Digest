{"content": " I\u2019ve also always been an east coast rap connoisseur with Jigga at the top of my list. I wasn\u2019t too much into the west either, but of course you have to go with the NWA crew mainly the big 3\u200a\u2014\u200aDRE, Cube and Snoop no matter who the fuk you are or where you\u2019re from. I got introduced to Southern hardcore rap down in TX in \u201808 and never looked back. There was a whole culture surrounding it I.e. Sizzup, slabs ( tricked out candy painted Caddies or Lincolns sporting weird chrome rims) and mouth grills\u200a\u2014\u200athat boy Paul Wall was crazy with them. Just really unique, authentic shit. I never got into the whole slowing down/ mixing tracks. Houston was the hub for it all at the time. TI crowned himself king of the south, but he never really connected with me.
