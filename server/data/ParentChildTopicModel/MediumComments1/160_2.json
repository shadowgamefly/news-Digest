{"content": "Thanks for sharing Gary! You have helped me incredibly with shifting my mindset something I have been working on for over 6 years as being in business I knew the biggest thing holding me back was my negativity. And although I have progressively improved over the years since I\u2019ve been fully engaged with your content again over the last few months I\u2019ve made a quantum leap\u2026 I\u2019m so grounded in positivity and gratitude now that I\u2019m experiencing my life from a completely different perspective and I can\u2019t even describe the joy and happiness it has brought me. On top of that I\u2019ve been able to learn so many skills from you to build my dream business\u00a0\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m on medium right now, watching, learning and then putting into action in my own business\u2026 and I\u2019m able to implement so quickly now because I don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks and understood that fear and doubt kills speed and I enjoy the process so much now that Im not chasing my dreams and aspirations anymore I\u2019m living them\u2026honestly thank you so much for everything you do\u2026 We live in amazing times where we can have such an impact in other people\u2019s lives without ever meeting them! And I wanted to give a little back and was looking for a \u201cspace\u201d that had your attention that would ensure the message could get back to you \ud83d\ude09 Thank you so much Jen ", "child": "", "name": "160_2", "parent": "160", "title": ""}
