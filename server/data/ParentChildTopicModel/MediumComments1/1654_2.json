{"content": "Even in Alabama\u2019s recent run of success, the Crimson Tide have rarely been perfect. Three of their national titles under Saban have come in seasons tainted by a loss. In 2011, that came in the SOMEBODY CROSSED MIDFIELD game, a 9\u20136 overtime thriller (sort of) against LSU. In 2012, it was Texas A&M\u2019s Johnny Manziel starting the stopwatch on his three years of fame in a 29\u201324 result in Tuscaloosa. Last year, the loss came against Ole Miss, 43\u201337. Even in 2009, when Alabama went 14\u20130, it had a couple of close calls, including a game against Tennessee saved by multiple Terrence Cody field goal blocks.", "child": "", "name": "1654_2", "parent": "1654", "title": ""}
