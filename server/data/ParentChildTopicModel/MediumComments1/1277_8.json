{"content": "Samuel\u200a\u2014\u200amany thanks for sharing. I feel it this a very valuable tool in making a summary of what DT encapsulates accessible to practitioners. One thing I always stumble upon is the usage of the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d within the context of DT. \u201cPursue a democratic spirit\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t know if/how the term is coined in DT literature but I always see two different associations from practitioners with the term. Democratic as in \u201cpower to all\u201d and Democratic as in \u201cpower to the majority\u201d. Within DT I would wholeheartedly agree on the first aspect\u200a\u2014\u200aempower the entire group as compared to traditional (individual) decision making by formalized authority. However, the second aspect can at times be counterproductive. I find there is often stages within a project where a minority can express very valuable ideas and paths to take, but at that moment it may not be possible to convince the majority. Be it for lack of time and space for discussion, proper argumentation not possible because consequences are hard to outline, idea based on intuition/inexplicable gut feeling, etc. Within INNOKI we sometimes had the feeling that democratic decision making could lead to a \u201cdomination of the mass\u201d in the long run and subsequently create power play and political coalitioning that blocks the creative spirit. As there are many other decision modes than democratic, like e.g. sociocracy or systemic consensus, maybe there is another expression to make the same point you\u2019re making like \u201cempower team-oriented decision making\u201d or similar.
