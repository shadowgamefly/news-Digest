{"content": "Two thoughts about the tripe on these pages. First, It seems that this is a simple confession that racism and bigotry against anyone is wrong and illegal unless, of course,it is being used against white boys and men. In this case it is encouraged. I find it curious how quickly so many have forgotten about the teachings of Martin Luther King who tried to teach all of us that we should evaluate a person based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin. With our SJW mentality, it is just as amazing how quickly the persecuted have become the persecutors as it is how that which was once thought to be a horrific behavior against individuals is now justified behavior.
