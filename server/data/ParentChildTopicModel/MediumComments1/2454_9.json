{"content": "It might shock the mind into realization if we realized a simple truth: Our present moment of mind is locked in an image (hologram). Our timeline is not the present moving to the future. We are reliving an image of the past to learn the future we have already reached. Genesis 1:27 is the Father (Aleph Bet in Hebrew) writing the WORD (JOHN 1). Hologram / Image. His Story is History, or Man from beginning to his Higher Mind State in our future, which we currently live to learn as children. This progression of machines is where we have come from, not where we are going. Time has a beginning and end. Imagine our future in 1000 years. We teach our children by time dilation in a virtual world. Avatar compresses 70 years of learning into 1.68 hours for a child. To the Lord, a day is 1000 years and 1000 years is a day. That\u2019s 7/100 for a typical 70 year life. We are this. You don\u2019t meditate to reach your higher mind. Your higher mind is meditating this existence presently. Meditation here simply reflects the light back to source (YOU!). YOU are the one meditating entanglment here. As Socrates would tell us in MENO, we already know it all. Entering the Kingdom is finding the answer to simulation (LOVE). I leave you to ponder this. ", "child": "", "name": "2454_9", "parent": "2454", "title": ""}
