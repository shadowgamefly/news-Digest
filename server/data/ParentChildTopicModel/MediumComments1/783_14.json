{"content": "I agree with the excellent writing above. When writing about \u2018Democracy\u2019 it is important to describe the scale you wish for. Every added govt regulation is sold as democracy in action. The US govt has never been able to get ahead of the curve and prevent financial disasters such as 2008 or the savings and loan disaster. Huge concentrations of financial power layered over by huge concentrations of \u2018democratically\u2019 established govt power have not worked. Dodd-Frank would not have prevented the past disasters and will not prevent future disasters. Dodd-Frank (CFPB), unlike the Vietnam War, cannot even be defunded by congress. I recall CFPB decisions are exempted from appeals to federal courts. If reducing the private concentration of power is a desirable goal (and I think it is), then forcing financial institutions and media conglomerates to split up into the smaller pieces I grew up with would be a good idea but I\u2019m not holding my breath.
