{"content": "Be careful about deducting travel with an extensive personal component. For instance, in your LA trip, if you stayed three days (just making that up; you didn\u2019t say how long you were there), but only had a two hour informational interview, the IRS might very well disallow the entire trip (except for expenses directly associated with the interview) For your HHN trip, you likely need to have evidence you produced something resembling work-product, like notes you took at the time to incorporate into your book. My employer allows employees to extend business trips for personal reasons but only to the extent where you will spend at least 1/2 the day for at least 1/2 the days of the trip (not including transit time) actually performing company business. This isn\u2019t about cost control (longer trips can often be cheaper as long as the business isn\u2019t covering personal-day expenses) but because they don\u2019t want to get slapped by the IRS for providing untaxed compensation.
