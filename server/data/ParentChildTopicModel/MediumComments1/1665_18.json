{"content": "I\u2019m a Penn Stater but when you really stop and look at it there isn\u2019t a lot to be upset about. If Penn State doesn\u2019t get into a 28\u20130 hole against Pitt they are in the playoff instead of Washington. Unfortunately that game happened. Ohio State\u2019s resume is significantly better than PSU\u2019s and there is no way around it. We beat them (on our field) in a close game and you can make a case for the work inside of conference to be comparable (even if it is in OSU\u2019s favor). However, in the other games we lost to Pitt on the road and they smoked a top 10 OU team. Penn State had a great season and if we get by USC we might open 2017 as a top 5 team considering just about the entire team is coming back. The top 4 teams made the playoff and I think it was a pretty easy call. ", "child": "", "name": "1665_18", "parent": "1665", "title": ""}
