{"content": "Awards shows are one giant circle jerk for the rich and famous-nothing else. I\u2019ve never watched them-never will. I know what music, TV shows and movies I like-I don\u2019t need validation from a bunch of old, white, rich assholes that decide who to give the statues to. I\u2019ve won 5 Emmy Awards and one Edward R. Murrow Award for TV Directing in my career so far. The trophies are really pretty, and they look good on the mantle, but other than that they really don\u2019t mean that much in the grand scheme. I got into the business because I love the work-period. I\u2019m very good at what I do, but I never needed validation about it from anyone. It\u2019s all a dog and pony show, designed so the powers that be can revel in their power and influence. Bottom line-don\u2019t let ANYONE tell you what you should like or not like-think for yourself. ", "child": "", "name": "1728_1", "parent": "1728", "title": ""}
