{"content": "I\u2019d even say you should skip the \u201ctry example layouts/API/tutorials\u201d part entirely. Aside from some very basic 20 min intros, creating throwaway code is a waste of time with any skill level. Any longer tutorial that holds your hand can create a false sense of progress. Very few of them are worth recreating rather than just gazing through its code. Everyone has lot of good ideas: turn them into apps, APIs, reusable components. Whatever you currently know, starting a real project will make you ask the same questions the best tutorials will, and every bit of result will be yours, while making something you can put in a public GitHub repo or CV.
