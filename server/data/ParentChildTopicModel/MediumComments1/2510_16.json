{"content": "Hey Alex thanks so much for this article. While it does clear some doubts I still have some questions: How would a normal user interact with an Ethereum powered dApp? Would they need to create an Ethereum account using MetaMask or something?What does \u2018signing a contract\u2019 exactly mean? Would users need to sign every time they use the dApp?Say the dApp is a voting system, does that mean they need to have ether in their account to cast a vote? How much ether would they need? I hope you can clear these doubts for me. Cheers! ", "child": "", "name": "2510_16", "parent": "2510", "title": ""}
