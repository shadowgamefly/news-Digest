{"content": "Great tip about waiting to contribute to IRAs until your taxes are otherwise sorted\u200a\u2014\u200awe might try that next year! We also have other pre-tax vehicles available to us through work that aren\u2019t subject to the same MAGI limits as IRAs, so I\u2019m exploring those. Regarding the pension, the contributions are mandatory, but it\u2019s a little more complicated. There is an option to just reduce your salary by the amount of the required contribution, in which case you wouldn\u2019t have to pay tax on that money BUT if you wanted to withdraw it from the plan for any reason (e.g. if you quit before the five-year vesting period, or you quit after you\u2019re vested but you\u2019d rather have the funds because your pension payout would be super low), you can\u2019t. With the track I\u2019m on, 14.5% of your salary is withdrawn automatically into the pension fund and you\u2019re taxed on it (!), but if you want to withdraw early, it\u2019s cold hard post-tax cash that you can have without penalty. I\u2019ve decided that\u2019s the better option given my work horizons, but I hate the \u201csettling up\u201d as you mention. ", "child": "", "name": "1141_4", "parent": "1141", "title": ""}
