I replied: Thanks for joining my LinkedIn network and adding me to yours; this is indeed timely. I believe that you would look really well in the startup I am preparing to launch.

Virtual Reality can be used to create a meditative state in which one identifies, and synchronizes movement, with an imaginary self, an animated transparent version of the body showing muscles and their action, which also visualizes (and transmits to the clinician as well) performance data and actual, planned and comparative parameters, such as heart rate, oxygen absorption, brain activity, localized pain, etc\u2026 Besides the business part my main activity, now scaled down for lack of resources, is running AMEN, Association to Empower the Needy: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B678n9B0TTqPZThjNmRlOTYtMGE0ZS00OGJhLTlkZTktMGY1YmVlY2EyODRj whose purpose is prevention of suicides and divorces caused by financial emargination through reinsertion of the endangered individual and family into productive society; I was already doing this prior to my aliya at Reb Shlomo Carlebach \u05d6\u05e6\u201d\u05dc\u2019s House of Love and Prayer in S.

I am also currently involved in clinical research on cannabis, LSD and related substances and am a proponent for the beneficial uses and effects of cannabis, LSD and psychedelics in a variety of areas. I will include a few of my recent publications on the subject as attachment files. It is very interesting you received and worked with LSD sent by the great Albert Hoffman.
