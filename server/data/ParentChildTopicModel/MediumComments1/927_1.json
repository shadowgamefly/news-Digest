{"content": "Declan I agree 100% with everything you have said. Great article and it\u2019s refreshing to hear a talent acquisition leader focusing on the fundamentals, instead of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening. We built a platform called Vervoe specifically to help employers with #3. We use the term automated interviews rather than work samples but they\u2019re designed to achieve exactly the objective you stated: \u201c\u2026 giving candidates a sample piece of work, similar to that which they would do in the job, and assessing their performance at it.\u201d It\u2019s the best indicator of future performance but it\u2019s also an opportunity to see if candidates will love doing the tasks they\u2019ll be doing on the job. No r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will ever reveal that. I also agree that reference checking is an underrated and overlooked practice. You might be familiar with a book called Who: The A Method for Hiring by ghSMART. It outlines in great detail how to conduct reference checks for senior roles and those methods are applicable more broadly. Finally, I\u2019m glad you called out the candidate experience. The term \u201chonored guest\u201d is a nice way of putting it. Really glad you wrote this article. Thanks, Omer ", "child": "", "name": "927_1", "parent": "927", "title": ""}
