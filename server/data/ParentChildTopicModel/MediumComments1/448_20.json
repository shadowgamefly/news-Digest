{"content": "Jake, you made some good points. That\u2019s what has been happening in Turkey for about a decade. The government has become increasingly authoritarian while keep winning elections. How did it happen? One tactic that the Turkish government used was to have someone from the government (e.g. the undersecretary of the Ministry of Health) to make comments on a contentious topic such as abortion. Have the media and the opposition discuss about this topic. If the opposition becomes too extreme, use this as a tool to consolidate your constituents. Spread fear and make sure that people see you as their savior. If the opposition is not very strong (people get wary of political disputes after a while), the government sees how much can they can push in this particular policy issue. Sometimes, as Jake mentioned, the government baits people with an irrelevant contentious topic, and passed some important laws and regulations while people were very much busy debating about irrelevant stuff. Using these tactics, the Turkish government has turned into an authoritarian regime. Let\u2019s hope the Trump administration is just incompetent, and no one in his team has the ability to think with such level of sophistication. Otherwise, I know what\u2019s coming up next. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. ", "child": "", "name": "448_20", "parent": "448", "title": ""}
