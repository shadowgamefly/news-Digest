{"content": "Spencer Hammer nailed it\u200a. Jed York is hated by most fans for getting rid of Harbaugh. Most certainly NOT a \u201cfootball decision.\u201d This was all about the egos of York and Trent Baalke, his golden boy. Harbaugh might have been tough to deal with\u200a\u2014\u200aeven toxic. But he got results and won like no other coach since the last time ownership blew it by getting rid of the Marriucci/Garcia tandem. Why? I guess ownership at the time thought Mooch was suddenly too short to coach and Garcia, too \u201ceffeminate\u201d to QB. Whatever. They, too, got results. I find a twist of irony in their decision. Alpha males like York and Baalke are the types who typically make fun of people legitimately needing a safe space. That\u2019s exactly where these \u201ctough guys\u201d went when they couldn\u2019t handle big bad Jim Harbaugh\u00a0and\u00a0got\u00a0rid\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0winner. Boo hoo.
