{"content": "Maybe, just maybe\u2026 Virginia Tech will be too. The team has multiple playmakers and finally, a scheme that serves the talent well. As long at they don\u2019t make plays for the other team they can score as explosively as the 2010 Tyrod Taylor unit, and the 2005 Marcus Vick led squad. A common thread perhaps though would be that those teams also lost it\u2019s two most high-profile contests. Can the DNA have changed slightly with the regime shift? If you\u2019re familiar with the program in Blacksburg, you\u2019d know that things moved at a tectonic pace. As long as Beamer was in charge, things would be predictable. Ultimately things grew as stale as the exhausted rhetoric surrounding our mystical Special Teams acumen. Truth be told Beamerball had become far more costly at it\u2019s depths, than it had ever been profitable at it\u2019s peak. Particularly in big contests; ST had begun to fail us on the big stage as early as 1999 in the Sugar Bowl when Peter Warrick and blocked kicks and missed FGs (along with a goal-line fumble that prevented VT from scoring in the first few plays, it woulda been a Blitzkrieg, Ice Bear\u2019s convinced). But this year, the ST has been a boon. Huge return game from Stroman, blocked kicks that lead to points, pin shutouts on teams. Aside from self-inflicted wounds at the gratuitous NASCAR affair, this team has the ingredients to compete for an ACC title. Whether that\u2019s enough to enter them back into playoff talk is way premature. I still believe they have a loss in front of them. But a 7\u20131 record in the Coastal with the right set of criteria gets them in the title game vs front-runner Clemson. Next week on the road vs Carolina, who will have to be emotionally flat after the tremendous effort yesterday, will be critical to any VT delusions of grandeur. After several teams in the 16\u201325 range lost, the Hokies might find themselves ranked next week. We know the Heels will be. Let\u2019s just remember there are 8 games + a title game left. The Coastal has a little more life than usual this year. ", "child": "", "name": "2006_1", "parent": "2006", "title": ""}
