{"content": "I used to feel sorry for the \u201cRed\u201d states, when it came to things that hurt their state, tax cuts for the rich, education cuts, tornadoes, flooding,\u2026\u2026\u2026..but now I don\u2019t. They voted for them, they bought it and there are no returns. When I see the weather on the news and see the destruction, I don;t care anymore. Call me heartless but they have no one to blame but themselves, don\u2019t believe in climate change, well think about they the next time someone or yourself has their house destroyed\u00a0. Can\u2019t have those Dem\u2019s and liberal in their state because they are heathens and the big guy in the sky (so they think) is going to make everything better. Well that does not seem to be working to well. ", "child": "", "name": "424_1", "parent": "424", "title": ""}
