{"content": "OK Kate I took onboard your challenge to reconsider my view. I finally came to the conclusion that, I think, an objective person would come to. Your response was more violent, more ugly and confrontational than the original incident. It was a sick response. Also you loud Americans should consider other cultures. Others have different views to you. If you are a visitor in another culture maybe you should not try using violence to impose arrogant American feminist views on others in their home country. In his culture his actions were completely appropriate. You cannot know if others take it as a joke or like the attention?
