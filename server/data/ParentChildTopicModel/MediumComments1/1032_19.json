{"content": "I develop a lot of wordpress blog templates and I got really used to having a 16px base for small screens and 18px for bigger ones, sometimes I even go bigger for really large screens. And it makes sense to increase margin, line height and paddings for example on paragraphs to be proportional. Not everything will need to scale though, and for those, pixel are fine. It\u2019s like you said. I need it, so I carry the shovel. But what I just wanted to say is that, it\u2019s pretty good idea to use a mix of rem and pixel. REMs are easy to calculate and IF you need, you can increase the stuff on your project proportionally and for the stuff you don\u2019t, you can use pixel. Great article btw, I just made an accessibility testing device for my friend too. *wink* ", "child": "", "name": "1032_19", "parent": "1032", "title": ""}
