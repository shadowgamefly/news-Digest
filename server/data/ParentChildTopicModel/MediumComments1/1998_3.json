She also was still in the bus at the arena when a manager went outside to pick up pizza with about 8min left in the game. She was also supposedly driving erratically on the way to the game. So it looks like she had been drinking pre-pick up and then nursing the box of wine while the game was going on.", "child": "", "name": "1998_3", "parent": "1998", "title": ""}
