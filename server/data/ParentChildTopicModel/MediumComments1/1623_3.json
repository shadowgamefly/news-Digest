{"content": "Good morning! So excited that I only have 3 DAYS LEFT at my current job. Whoooot! I estimated that I would spend <$100 this weekend\u2026.bwhahahahahah. Yeah, that didn\u2019t happen. Friday: My BFF came over and we went to pick out plants for my landscaping and some dry-wall supplies for his house ($96). I couldn\u2019t actually plant anything though because of the frost advisory. Saturday: Went shopping with my friend and her niece and found some really great outfits for her. (She is so lucky to have such a generous (and child-free) auntie.) Of course I couldn\u2019t help but pick up a few things for myself\u200a\u2014\u200a($24) at White Barn for some air fresheners and ($24) at Sigma for a new brush and potted gel eyeliner. (Worth it for more-perfect wings.) Then it was on to the grocery store ($81) and home to mow the lawn and work on phase 2 of the landscaping project. (Final phase\u200a\u2014\u200aACTUALLY PUTTING PLANTS INTO THE GROUND\u200a\u2014\u200awill hopefully come to a conclusion tonight! Whoooo!) Sunday: Chores in the morning and gaming with friends all afternoon. My BFF and I actually managed to beat the two smartest ladies I know at Trivial Pursuit. It was a red-letter day! (I was thoroughly trounced in Ticket to Ride and Quantum, but managed a win playing both Munchkin and Lords of Waterdeep.)
