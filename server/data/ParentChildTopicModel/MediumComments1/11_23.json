Working in the restaurant industry, it\u2019s usually black people who seem to be the ones expecting the most service. \u201cShe was exercising her right not just as a human, but as an American, white woman human\u201d So you\u2019ve never seen a black woman ask for more peppers? Or does a black woman asking for more not fit your narrative? \u201cThis idea of the fear of \u201cthe ask\u201d, this harkens back to a time when asking for more hog, or more time alone with your partner on the other plantation, was a whooping, a beating, a punishment, a hanging\u201d Literally no one except you is buying into this, but okay. \u201cPrivilege, its essence, is ending police brutality with a Pepsi can\u201d No, that\u2019s called corporate America. It\u2019s capitalized on every movement, every social issue. Clearly you think yours is untouchable. \u201cMy mother gave me lessons, but no tools\u201d May surprise you to learn that millions of white people have that exact same story \u201chere will be the lot who will ask \u201cwhy so many children\u201d spouting whatever catchy phrase Rush Limbaugh spews, always tied with a ribbon of racism at its fringes; to them I see, would you ask if she not Black?\u201d Yes I would. Though I don\u2019t think 3 kids is \u201cso many\u201d, I often question large families where the children clearly aren\u2019t being taken care of. White or black.

I don\u2019t tell them I\u2019ve actually worked to build my social media profiles into something I\u2019m personally proud of.
