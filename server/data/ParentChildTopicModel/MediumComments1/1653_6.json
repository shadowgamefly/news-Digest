{"content": "\u201c Washington, Clemson, and Ohio State are all better teams than Alabama has played so far\u201d False. I would say that there\u2019s a strong argument that Ole Miss and LSU could beat Washington. Whether by the metrics or the eye test, I think that Ole Miss would have enough offensively and that LSU\u2019s defense is better than any other defense that Washington has faced all season. Their offense since the coaching change could give them enough to at least make a game out of it. Washington has played a lot of passive defenses this season as opposed to the more attacking defenses associated with the SEC. The entire premise of this article would be vastly more effective if arguing the merit and talent of Washington. ", "child": "", "name": "1653_6", "parent": "1653", "title": ""}
