{"content": "\u201cNone of us are entirely open-minded.\u201d Maybe you should try speaking for yourself and do not be so arrogant as to presume you can claim to know the mind-set of everybody else, based entirely on your own prejudices and whatever new-age politically correct mumbo-jumbo you were force fed in college. \u201cIt\u2019s like when people say, \u201cI don\u2019t see colour\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body.\u201d Not possible.\u201d Yes it is quite possible. Maybe you have just never lived amongst a muti-ethnic population. The only thing I know about you is that you have the arrogance to think you understand what is or is not possible for other people. Here is a clue. Just because something is not possible for you, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible for people who may be a little more grown up than you. You have the right to keep turning people into walking caricatures in your own mind if you want to. But stop assuming that everyone else has such a narrow view of the world. \u201cPeople only say that if they don\u2019t know how racism and bigotry work.\u201d Do they really? And I suppose racism is defined as whatever pompous virtue-signalling \u201ceducators\u201d like you decide it must be. Here is the pretty much universally accepted definition of racism. It is what the vast majority of people understand racism to be and most people know full well exactly what it is and how it works. Racism: A belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of one race over another. \u201cWe have all been raised to judge people based on race\u201d If you were raised like that then you have my sympathy. Most people I know were raised in completely the opposite view. \u201cWe are creating a reinforcing cycle; the more we cling to the belief that we are free of bias, the more defensive, blind, and deaf we are to our biases.\u201d This is classic ideological brainwashing which has been used to demonise a particular group for thousands of years. The major religions used in the form of the concept of \u201coriginal sin.\u201d We are all inherently guilty even if we have never done anything wrong. The only way to be forgiven our sins is to confess, over and over again. Self-flagellating is the only path to salvation. The Inquisition were masters of it. The Marxists were too. The great purges included festivals of innocent people, confessing their guilt in order to be seen as \u201cgood communists\u201d after all. Most of all refusing to agree that you are guilty (because you aren\u2019t) is all the proof needed that you are indeed guilty. Kind of like a witch trial really. That seems to be the concept you\u2019re running with. Shame on you and your ilk for infecting the education system with it: This garbage is not education. It is indoctrination and young students of all colours deserve better than this bigoted nonsense. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s annoying for him to experience people making negative assumptions about him because he is a white male. But it\u2019s also time for him to grow up.\u201d Oh my: You have been drinking this cool-aid for so long you would even poison your own son with it! Time for him to grow up you say? He should just turn the other cheek because black people have to deal with it too. That was another feature of communist doctrine: They would agree with your suggestion that two wrongs do make a right. \u201cFor example, black women put up with people\u2019s negative assumptions about them on a regular basis.\u201d I am sure they do. Black men do too. So do white men; as evidenced by your little screed. Then again at least there don\u2019t seem to be many people actually making a living from making negative assumptions about black people. But I can assure you that absolutely everybody has to put up with people making negative assumptions about them, as your son has. But you dismiss it when it happens to him, and cast it as a serious offence when it happens to someone else. I am pretty sure that is not how you do mothering and I am positive that is not how you do education. But I am confused again over your constant portrayal of white boys as the perpetrators of racism and black girls as the victims. Have you been drinking the feminist cool-aid too? Did you just get the whole package deal on bigotry? Are white girls not included and do black boys also not suffer from racism? White boys obviously do too, as your son has made clear. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting choosing which battles to fight and how to fight them\u200a\u2014\u200awithout being stereotyped as an \u201cangry black woman.\u201d How would you know that Rosalind? You look pretty white to me. Lots of things are exhausting to lots of people. How about the far more widely cast refrain of \u201cangry white men\u201d or \u201cwhite privilege\u201d or \u201cfearful white men?\u201d How many disparaging stereotypes can you apply to a particular group of people in one page Rosalind? Because I think you just won that competition. And if you read your own article carefully you will find that it is your position that two wrongs make a right? \u201cI\u2019ve had several teen boys say recently that they just wished people would stop talking about race and that if we did, it would stop racism from happening.\u201d Some unusual wisdom from teen boys: I heard the same point being made very eloquently by American actor Morgan Freeman too. \u201cIt\u2019s an illogical argument\u00a0:\u201d No it isn\u2019t. It is a very sensible argument. Racism dissipates when people stop looking for excuses to see it everywhere. First it becomes a joke and then it simply evaporates. That is why toddlers are not racist. Because they don\u2019t even know what it is: \u201cThe people who experience racism and discrimination have no choice but to think about it and talk about it because it\u2019s part of their everyday experience. It\u2019s only people who are not discriminated against that believe this argument makes sense because they can convince themselves that the problem doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d The people who are discriminated and routinely castigated in America today are primarily white males. Just so you know. It is also illegal to discriminate against anybody in the US except for white males under certain circumstances. Just so you know. Example: You have repeatedly blanket-insulted \u201cwhite-boys\u201d in this article while raging against racism without a hint of irony. Try insulting \u201cblack boys\u201d as a group and see how long it takes you to get banned. \u201cBut their response is motivated by fear\u200a\u2014\u200afear of not knowing how to be with people who have a different life experience\u201d No it isn\u2019t. It is motivated by boredom; by irritation; by a simple desire not to want to be around toxic judgemental people who feel the need to make everything about race. \u201cYes, I\u2019m male and white but I\u2019m also a lot of other things.\u201d Oh Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa: Should the \u201cwhite boy\u201d throw himself at the feet of the noble \u201cPOC\u201d while rolling out his self-esteem and dignity to be stamped on? \u201cHe also need to challenge himself.\u201d No he doesn\u2019t. He is not \u201cprivileged\u201d (whatever you think that means) he actually has less societal privilege in many ways than minorities and he certainly has far less societal privilege than his female peers. If you didn\u2019t know that then drop me a note and I will be happy to educate you on the subject. He doesn\u2019t owe anybody else anything. What he really should do is find himself a better school; one that is not full of \u201ceducators\u201d like you. He deserves better than to be surrounded by nasty little bigots constantly judging him as somehow inherently dysfunctional because of his sex and his skin colour. Have you looked up \u201cbigotry\u201d yet because it is obvious you don\u2019t know what it means? But I suspect that you do know what it means but you do it anyway. You do it because racism, like sexism; is a billion dollar industry and there are too many foundations and think-tanks and \u201ccharitable\u201d organisations from the grass-roots to the highest levels of governments that depend on it being an epidemic, even when it clearly isn\u2019t; and there is all that lovely funding to be had. So let\u2019s get busy and find racism under every stone, in every tree and in every misunderstood sentence. And if we have to poison the minds of our young students and divide them like they haven\u2019t been divided in decades, then so be it: It is our bread and butter after all. It is in our interests to manufacture as much of what we claim to be fighting as possible so we can continue to fight it, while feeling terribly morally superior of course. We will damage the futures of white kids by teaching them that they need to be constantly diagnosing themselves as problematic. We will damage the futures of black kids by teaching them that they perpetual victims, destined to be held back by a systemically racist system. We will indoctrinate them with these self-fulfilling prophecies because well\u200a\u2014\u200aracism is our bread and butter. You are damaging the self-esteem of white kids and dis-empowering black kids. You want to stop racism and do some good for both black kids and white kids\u200a\u2014\u200astop telling white boys that they have some duty to \u201cshoulder the white man\u2019s burden\u201d and stop telling black kids that the world owes them something.
