{"content": "I see what you\u2019re describing as somewhat akin to pandering. Grynbaum may have an opinion, & you may be able to figure out what it is, but if he\u2019s doing the job well, don\u2019t bet on the latter being right. That\u2019s not a compliment, because the reason isn\u2019t some loyalty to journalistic objectivity, but rather, the skill of making each audience think you\u2019re talking to them. Give everyone\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least, a wider cross-section of people\u200a\u2014\u200asomething to latch-on to. I don\u2019t know Maddow\u2019s work well, have just seen a dozen or so of her spiels, but I get the sense she\u2019s more focused on \u2018authenticity\u2019 as her brand. She wants people to know where she stands. That\u2019s marketing, too, but it\u2019s qualitatively different from what I see Grynwald doing, and what seems to me to have become more or less the standard: Be ambigious about what you\u2019re trying to do. If you\u2019re joking, be subtle enough that someone can plausibly take it seriously; if you\u2019re serious, be sly enough that someone can plausibly construe it as a joke (or you can semi-plausibly make the case that they should).
