{"content": "Draymond is so overrated. Everyone looks alot better when they\u2018re dancing through blowouts. He can play the pest well enough in the regular season, but with Bogut now gone, his size will be even further exposed this year. If shambling bums like Sam Adams and Tristan Thompson can record 20 boards a night on him last year, I wonder what legit bigs DJ or Gobert will do to him in round 2 this year. And that\u2019s assuming Nurkic doesn\u2019t obliterate him first. Gobert is definitely the DPOY this season. ", "child": "", "name": "102_5", "parent": "102", "title": ""}
