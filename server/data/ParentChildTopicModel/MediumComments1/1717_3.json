People generally don\u2019t try to lose weight until they need to lose a lot of weight, and we have a lot of cultural barriers in place to keep it this way. If you\u2019re just trying to lose a little weight, you will often encounter a fair amount of resistance from well meaning people who tell you that you\u2019re not fat, and that you just shouldn\u2019t worry about it.
