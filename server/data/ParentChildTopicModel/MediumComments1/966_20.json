{"content": "I don\u2019t use Redux in any real production apps, so I have less exposure to it, but here\u2019s some general guidelines: Testing that connect wired your components up to the store is a concern of Redux itself, so testing connected components fails rule #2 from my post.Your component tests should be around your unconnected components. If your app only cares about using your connected component, sometimes it can be useful to make a \u201cprivate named export\u201d just for using in your tests, like so: const MyComponent = /* ... */const MyConnectedComponent = connect(/* ... */)(MyComponent); export default MyComponent;export const _UnconnectedMyComponent = MyComponent; You should test your mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, etc functions.You should use selectors throughout your store to make your state as modular as possible! This will make it easier to unit test. ", "child": "", "name": "966_20", "parent": "966", "title": ""}
