{"content": "Hi Kasia, Congratulations to you and the rest of the team for finally launching the platform that you guys have all worked long and hard to build. I\u2019m very honored to have been a part of the BETA testing team, even through the various bugs and errors. I think back to where I was two years ago. Podcasting has always been a passion of mine, but distribution was just about impossible to do easily and affordably, and I wrote about my frustrations right here on Medium. Podcast Integration With Medium? COUNT ME IN!This concept is especially appealing to individuals who like to blog and podcast, but don\u2019t have the time and/or energy to pursue both.medium.com Within just a few hours of me posting the above response, Borja Rojano himself contacted me to tell me about this startup that he was working on, and invited me to be a part of the beta testing team. Upon hearing the details of the concept for TapeWrite, I knew that I had to be a part of this experiment in podcast pioneering. The rest is history, as the saying\u00a0goes. I\u2019m proud to be a part of the TapeWrite family, and will continue to offer help and feedback whenever you guys need it. Thanks for having me on board, and congratulations once again!
