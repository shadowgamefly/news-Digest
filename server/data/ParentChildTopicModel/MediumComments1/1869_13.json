{"content": "52-Week Writing Challenge Accepted! I\u2019m Writing Letters to Everything. I\u2019m excited to start of the year with a writing challenge of fairly reasonably sized proportions! As a part of the 52-Week Writing Challenge, proposed by The Writing Cooperative, I\u2019ll be publishing one letter each week. My commitment for this challenge is to publish one personal letter from me (or not?) to something or someone each week. Sometimes I\u2019ll choose the recipient of the letter. Other times I\u2019ll let you and/or the members of The Writing Cooperative choose (you can join here if you haven\u2019t already). For a quick example of the type of letter I\u2019ll be writing check out my last letter to my all-time favorite sweet treat: Dear Haribo Gold BearsWhen this all started, I didn\u2019t want to admit that your flashy packaging was even mildly enticing.medium.com I\u2019ll publish these each week with the tag \u201c52 Week Writing Challenge\u201d and you can also find it in the ReplyAll publication: ReplyAllWe write letters to anyone and everything across all of time and space. Nothing is off limits except limits themselves\u2026medium.com Since we are already in week 1 of the challenge, you can expect my first letter soon! You still have time to jump into the challenge or contact me if you just want to write a letter to something yourself. We\u2019ve had a few great contributions already this year and I would love to see what all of our lovely brains can come up with.  ReplyAll needs more\u00a0writers! Do you want to write letters to your favorite or least favorite things? To someone you never met and really want to? To someone you see everyday and wish you didn\u2019t? To yourself in the past or the future? To your dream vacation destination? To Platapi, echidnas, or three-toed sloths? Well, you can and you should. To be added as a writer for the ReplyAll publication, send a letter draft to: replyallmedium@gmail.com Everyone loves a letter! ", "child": "", "name": "1869_13", "parent": "1869", "title": ""}
