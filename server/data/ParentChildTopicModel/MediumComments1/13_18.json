{"content": "Hi Gal, Thank you for your opinion on gradients. I\u2019ve been thinking about using gradients within my own brand identity, yet there is a difference between a longterm brand identity and a trendy one. I think flat colours maintain a longer life existence. But i believe that indeed a gradient can 1) attract more attention and 2) give a friendlier approach. If it is used subtle within two colour shades than yes we can achieve something of both ways. Maybe define a brand identity with 2 flat colours + a gradient that uses these 2 flat colours? A introduction where a gradient was used followed by a consistency of those flat colours? Anyway it\u2019s a great article and really love your opinion. I\u2019ll make sure to hit the recommend button and share it on twitter! Looking forward to more of your articles! Grts,Romain ", "child": "", "name": "13_18", "parent": "13", "title": ""}
