{"content": "Great article Ravi Raman.Multi tasking is evil no doubt about it and it is a big cause for today\u2019s alarmingly increasing burnouts and blackouts. In fact today\u2019s millenial generation prides itself to be the only generation which has multi tasking ingrained into its DNA. There has been lot of talks on the evils of multi tasking.But let us go a bit further,not all multi tasking is bad There are two types of multi tasking\u200a\u2014\u200agood and bad.The bad one,we already know which is the main cause of stress and loss of productivity. The good multi tasking uses the cognitive power of the brain and can be used when we are doing a lower rung task with a higher rung task.For example if you are in the kitchen,you are baking,cooking and also checking the dough at the same time.In this case the person cannot work in after the other,he has to do everything at the same time.This works because except cooking the other tasks are of lower intensity which can be combined with one higher intensive task. So let us take multi tasking in a positive way\u00a0!!! ", "child": "", "name": "909_13", "parent": "909", "title": ""}
