{"content": "\u201c\u2026a white female character who, to those who know the code, is acting out racist microaggressions\u2026\u201d The whole concept of \u2018coded microagressions\u2019 is racially divisive. I understand that it is entirely possible for people to make snide, cutting remarks in seeming innocence that are intended to provoke.

The idea behind \u2018coded microagressions\u2019 is that if a member of a minority party felt vaguely uncomfortable about anything a white person says, it is because the white person is intentionally trying to belittle them, or \u201ckeep them in their place\u201d.
