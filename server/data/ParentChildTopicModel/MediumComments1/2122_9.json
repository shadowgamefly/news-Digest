{"content": "Hi Tom, thanks for this nice read. I would also like to point that Typescript, in my opinion, is a great replacement for Babel. Babel is a great project but the whole plugin ecosystem might get a bit overwhelming sometimes. Typescript, on the other hand is a nice single dependency that usually just works, and once you figureout how to handle\u00a0.tsconfig.json, you are golden\u00a0:) I am really happy with where Glimmer/Ember are headed.
