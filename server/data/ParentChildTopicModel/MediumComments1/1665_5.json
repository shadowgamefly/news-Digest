{"content": "USC is a 6-point favorite over Penn State in the Rose Bowl. That isn\u2019t some sportswriter\u2019s rhetorical argument, that\u2019s real money set by people in Vegas who will get fired if they\u2019re wrong (unlike sportswriters). Even if The Trojans get a home team advantage for not having to travel, that\u2019s still only 3 points on a betting line. If the selection criteria is the \u201cbest\u201d four teams (which according to CFP\u2019s charter, it is), it\u2019s hard to argue Penn State is better when they aren\u2019t even favored to win the \u201cconsolation\u201d game. To me the CFP selectors only ranked Penn State 5th to assure they went to the Rose Bowl as the B1G Champion. That said the Rose Bowl may (again) be a more exciting matchup than any of the CFP games. If Alabama vs Ohio State happens, it promises to be an ugly defensive slog where USC vs Penn State will feature two of the most dynamic QBs in college football in Darnold and McSorley. Both teams are emerging from two of the most punishing (and egregious) NCAA sanctions handed out in a generation. And both feature similar win streaks that will end for one of the teams. And both coaches are bald as a cue ball. Penn State, you\u2019re right where you belong. Be happy for it. ", "child": "", "name": "1665_5", "parent": "1665", "title": ""}
