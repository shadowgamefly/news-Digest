{"content": "*CORPORATE CULTURE WILL CHANGE* Corporate Culture of this \u201cNow and Here\u201d has been made possible by the people who allow it to prosper and to continue to exist. As more and more people wake up to the Sacred Meaning in/of themselves and in/of others, and finally also, in/of their Work, both individually and collectively, they all will know that the word \u201cVALUE\u201d must be returned to the word \u201cWORK\u201d. Mutual Respect between Owners of Business and Their Staff/Workers. Respect covers Treatment/Compensation/Mutually Agreed Duties and Rights, because the \u201cGive and Take\u201d of all Mutual Exchanges should contain some Dignity and Humanity as we all are in this journey from cradle to grave, together, we all must survive and make the best of our lives and take care of our own selves and of our best interests. This Species must learn the Art of Self-Respect and the Art of saying \u201cNo\u201d to Corporate Criminals\u2019 Cultures and their Under-Compensation coupled with Overwork / Slave oriented Packages of pure Abuse against the Humanity of Their workers. It goes something like this\u200a\u2014\u200aUse, abuse and dispose! Who? Human beings, people just like you and I, somebody\u2019s Mother, somebody\u2019s Father, somebody\u2019s Daughter, somebody\u2019s Son, somebody\u2019s Sister\u2026 Poetic, but it is the way it is until people begin to say -No! Corporate Culture will change and someday, people will be proud of their Employers again and their employers will be proud of their employees\u2026 A new age when it feels like a big family again, a warmly united Country, People and Queen!
