{"content": "Good write-up. Thanks for sharing. Would be curious to know if @RemoteAction and @AuraEnabled share a common serialization and marshaling engine. Remote actions have been fairly stable in recent years. But not supporting all intrinsic data types in Aura? Hmmmmm...\u00a0So much regression and additional boilerplate experienced when moving to AuraEnabled controllers, but very few benefits. All the extra security hurdles with locker service and IFRAME\u2019d containers, yet Developers still need to write their own CRUD/FLS enforcement. So many contradictions in this architecture. Personally, I\u2019m trying to marshall all I can through <lightning:container /> to avoid this headache. ", "child": "", "name": "987_4", "parent": "987", "title": ""}
