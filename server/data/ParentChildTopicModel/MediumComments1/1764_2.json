{"content": "What Traditional Tradesman said: It is not a \u201cthink piece.\u201d It is a hateful racist rant against white people. What strikes me is that so many of these \u201cblack activists\u201d think that spewing hatred at white people will actually do black people any good? This this person really believe that constant attempts to alienate the majority population is going to help the futures of young black kids in any way? Are they really that chronically stupid? Never mind anyone\u2019s feelings getting hurt. That is unimportant. It is people\u2019s attitudes being changed from positive to negative that is the problem. Hate be-gets hate and racism be-gets racism. And it doesn\u2019t matter who its coming from. Hate the KKK by all means; not because of their skin colour but because of what they stand for. Most white people despise them too. In the end; white racist groups really hurt white people most of all, and black racist groups hurt black people. As for sitting in a room full of people of any colour. I would feel quite comfortable sitting in a room full of black people. I would not enter a room full of \u201cblack activists.\u201d I do not want to be around people who hate me because of my skin colour. I have no sympathy for them and no respect for them and I would never offer them any support of any kind. You do not get a free pass on hate-peddling just because you have dark skin.
