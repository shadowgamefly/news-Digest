{"content": "I also question the idea that you can study whatever you like without a sober analysis of your entire situation. If you generate significant debt for your gender studies phD, and at the end of it find work as a school teacher, don\u2019t blame the world, the economy or any of your favorite villains. Its on you. Figure out a plan to extinguish your debt before you enter into a life of servitude. It\u2019s foolish to believe that anyone owes you six figures because you can quote French poetry even as you serve up skinny mocha lattes in your barista side career.

Figure out what your contribution to the world could be, do that; along the way study whatever else tickles your fancy. Just common sense.
