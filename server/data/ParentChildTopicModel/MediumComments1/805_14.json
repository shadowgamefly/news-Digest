{"content": "Really loved your simple explanation of this issue thru the lens of the user, developer and designer. I didn\u2019t use a grid system for a long time, always feeling slightly encumbered by it when working on a new project I often abandoned it around 1/4 of the way thru. Now that I\u2019m working on more mature and complex projects, it really is a lifesaver, especially when a developer needs to make some decision about the alginment of an undesigned element. Often, now that they have the grid and our style guide, they can prototype it up themselves and neither of us has to stop what we\u2019re doing to hash it out. Thanks for this and it\u2019s well written to boot! ", "child": "", "name": "805_14", "parent": "805", "title": ""}
