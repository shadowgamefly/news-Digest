{"content": "ESPN will let their personalities rip on Trump all they want (which is fine), but I don\u2019t like the hypocrisy of disciplining Schilling for doing the same. I for one would much rather we did stick to sports. I can\u2019t even look at Facebook anymore without a nonstop barrage of pro-liberal/anti-Trump posts. I don\u2019t care about a Ringer writer\u2019s political opinion anymore than cousin Susie\u2019s. I go to FB to see what people are up to, not what they\u2019re bitching about and I come to the Ringer for sports and entertainment articles. If I wanted a constant stream of far left editorializing, I can just as easily click on CNN or Huffington Post. ", "child": "", "name": "266_23", "parent": "266", "title": ""}
