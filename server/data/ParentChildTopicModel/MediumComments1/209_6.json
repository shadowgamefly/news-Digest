{"content": "Darius: I wonder what possesses us human beings to have the urge to elevate one thing or person by means of putting down something else or someone else. That\u2019s quite a self-limiting approach when in reality there\u2019s plenty space for everything and everybody in this world. Mr. Paulo Coelho is a writer of writers. I\u2019m sure any of us would love to write the way he does (superbly). One of his most famous book, The Alchemist, isn\u2019t meant to be a self-help book. It, however, has become such because readers have turned it into\u00a0one. The life of Mr. Coelho, especially his youth, deserves respect and admiration for fighting back to become the writer he\u200a\u2014 without a doubt\u200a\u2014 has become. Writers come and go, but some standout for life, and there\u2019s a reason for that to be the case. Some of that has a lot to do with the evocative congruency of the author\u2019s work. The going to places where others didn\u2019t or haven\u2019t, the way of taking care of the reader without spoon-feeding every word, every thought. To live in a world totally full of Either Or is way too limited. There\u2019s plenty of room for all sorts of authors. Each of them brings a nice offering (book) to a very intimate gathering (the author and the reader). Your comparison\u200a\u2014 Way better than\u200a\u2014 made me think of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (aka Gabo). I can\u2019t imagine myself (or anyone as a matter of FACT) giving a higher rank to another author by saying this or that writer is better than Gabo\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude. That\u2019s exactly, as in identically, you comparing another writer with Mr. Coelho\u200a\u2014 who hasn\u2019t become a writer without personal struggles. Mr. Coelho has mastered his craft beautifully and professionally. We would be lucky to achieve the great success and respect he has earned\u200a\u2014 emphasis on earned!\u203c\ufe0f Enough said! Thanks for the pondering I had to do with your article. Much appreciated!\ud83d\udcdd ", "child": "", "name": "209_6", "parent": "209", "title": ""}
