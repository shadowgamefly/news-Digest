{"content": "Hi Ravi, great post. Though am not your target audience but being a fellow founder/growth lover, found this a good read. I actually started a platform called http://uxhack.co some time back on similar lines\u200a\u2014\u200aa platform to help startups identify such small tweaks/improvements through private crowd-sourcing. As you would know, not everyone is able to get it right\u00a0:) And one of the extension of UX Hack has been, http://uxhack.co/knowledge\u00a0, which again stems from my pain point of lack of central repository of identifying real stuff products do for growth. I would want to take this opportunity to request you if I can use smaller nuggets from this post and submit it in my portal? Also, let me know if you would like to join as a contributor, I would be more than glad to have you onboard! ", "child": "", "name": "673_4", "parent": "673", "title": ""}
