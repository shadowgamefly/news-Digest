{"content": "I think sticking to sports is boring, but the politicization of nearly everything can grow tiresome after a while. When looking around to see what Steve Kerr thought about the Warrior\u2019s performance, that is relegated behind his thoughts on whatever asinine thing Trump did or said. I, personally, want to know both things. The problem becomes when the political is elevated over the sports part every single time. I assume there\u2019s click based evidence to support this editorial push. It\u2019s just not always for me. The Ringer is a particularly interesting circumstance. As a new website, it\u2019s growing into and out of coverage areas and one place I\u2019d like to see less of is it\u2019s political coverage. It\u2019s one thing when a seasoned vet like Mr. Curtis delves into the Republican National Convention. It\u2019s another thing when \u201c24-year-old Pop culture writer X\u201d who I\u2019m just getting to know posts a story on the issue of the day. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for. I can go to Slate or Salon or any of 100 other websites that allow people to write whatever the hell they want. But I suppose what I want or don\u2019t want doesn\u2019t matter. The obvious solution here is \u201cDon\u2019t read what you don\u2019t want to\u201d which is what I do. I just am particularly curious about who comes to the Ringer for political takes.
