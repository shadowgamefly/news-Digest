{"content": "Thanks for the thoughtful post and valuable perspective, Daniel. Clearly there will be more of a digital divide between people who can afford to pay for their media vs. those who cannot. However I believe it\u2019s too early to declare that a subscription-led media industry cannot succeed. First, many of the examples you cite of failed paywalls, etc. come from companies that started with an ad-supported model, then bolted on subscriptions to try and stay alive. That means they are pursuing two strategies simultaneously, which hurts focus, brings legacy models, etc. The second issue is that we have yet to see innovation that can come from \u201cburning the ships\u201d and committing to subscriptions as an industry. Maybe we\u2019ll finally see enough energy around micro-payments (i.e. put a nickel in the jar when you click thru to read an article). Maybe we\u2019ll see a \u201cNetflix of writing\u201d finally come around. Medium is just starting its journey. They and others may surprise us with ingenuity. After all, who would have guessed that Amazon would offer free movies with Prime delivery subscriptions, or that Netflix would be spending on original content. Let\u2019s give the industry time to figure it out\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, the current ad-model is a disaster and getting worse, so the only hope will come from trying something new.
