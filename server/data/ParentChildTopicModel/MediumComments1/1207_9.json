{"content": "Animals are so much better than we are because of their simplicity. My cat doesn\u2019t care about the red spot on my nose, my haircut, or my grades. He loves me because I am kind and feed him. It\u2019s easy. There\u2019s no conceit, no calculated planning. When he meows it\u2019s not because he wants to be annoying, but because in his little mind the big wooden rectangle blocking his path is the most important thing right now and he needs the help of his human to conquer it. There is no second layer of interpretation beyond the interaction, only imminent emotion. That\u2019s why spending time alone does not mean that my cat has to leave my side. He can stay because he is not complicated and only as selfish as nature made him; he doesn\u2019t know if he is comforting me or not, which is reassuring because I do not need to think about the why of his actions. Still sometimes I wish he could understand a little more; dogs seem to be more empathetic in that regard. ", "child": "", "name": "1207_9", "parent": "1207", "title": ""}
