{"content": "Yes, Europe, don\u2019t count America out, we always have more wars to push and weapons to sell. As long as we can continue to use nearly 60% of our citizen\u2019s tax dollars on military expenditures (while letting our country fall apart and gleefully ignoring the needs of our people), we can provide security for all Club NATO members funded by our continued plunder of all outside nations on a 100 year rotation. Never doubt the value of your Platinum membership Europe. That\u2019s right, as a collection of vassal states within the American empire, anyone that flies business class or above will accrue NATO plunder points on their Club NATO cards. And John McCain and Lindsey Graham will be fighting for your freedom to strip the lives and resources from those not in the Club NATO clique. They are just getting started with this this Islamic Terror thing, but rest assured, they have plenty of other demons in the pipeline. And, yes, someday soon they will reach the promise land of bomb-bomb-bomb-bomb-bomb-Iran. And never forget that our record arms sales to the human rights champions Saudi Arabia were all about \u201cwe stand for truth against falsehood, freedom against tyranny, right against injustice, hope against despair\u201d. Why is that? I don\u2019t know, but John McCain is a war hero, so we better just believe whatever he says. The Iliad is an outdated tale that could really use a face lift, a 2017 version. Instead of Helen being kidnapped, it all starts when Russia steals our election. Thinking that providence and American exceptionalism are on their side, NATO surrounds Russia. Finally, Lindsey Graham convinces the CIA to fund Ukrainian Nazis to start a border skirmish with Russia. Everything goes wrong and McCain ends up drifting in a lifeboat until he is rescued by Syrian refugees, but not before hiding in a cave to avoid a hacked drone that is stalking him.
