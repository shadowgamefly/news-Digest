{"content": "In light of your story, there are refugees, who truly ARE refugees (see Christians and Yazidis, Kurds, and other ME religious minorities) and then there are \u201crefugees\u201d (see population, stealth jihadis, bent on overtaking and overthrowing our government, to establish a world caliphate). To the former group we do indeed owe our compassion and aid, as human beings, at least, if not as Christians; but THOSE are generally NOT the ones being helped by our governments. To the latter, our Constitution and laws declare openly we owe NOTHING; not asylum or anything else. It\u2019s actually against the law to aid and abet anyone seeking to overthrow our Constitution; as such \u201crefugees\u201d are doing, and using our own laws against us to do so, by pretending to be a religion when, in fact, they are pushing a political system. Do we owe it to anyone to commit national suicide? I don\u2019t believe Jesus ever advocated that anymore than individual suicide. ", "child": "", "name": "562_6", "parent": "562", "title": ""}
