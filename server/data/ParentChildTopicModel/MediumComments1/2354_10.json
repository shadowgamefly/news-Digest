{"content": " How to Be Sold Nothing (Unless It Makes\u00a0Sense) Basics of self-defense against the emotional sophistry of sales \u201cpeople\u201d By MARTIN REZNY I\u2019m generally the kind of person who is exceptionally difficult to trigger, but I guess there are some statements the only logical response to which is anger. In the interest of avoiding the improper use of pathos in my argumentation and thus defeating my own point, let me convert most of my anger to logic and explain thoroughly all the levels on which the above article is wrong. But let\u2019s start with a little bit of ethos and context first, as there\u2019s nothing wrong with facts that are true in a non-misrepresented way. The fact is I\u2019ve been a debater for about fifteen years now, and if you\u2019re the sort of person who cares about winning (which I\u2019m not), know that I have won many debates and a number of awards. I have been a judge of speakers at competitions for about a decade of that time, and a host of international debating tournaments and exchanges for the last six. I also have a formal education in philosophy, which I seriously doubt Charles has. Why, you may ask? A question\u200a\u2014\u200ahow well do you know the work of Aristotle, and specifically the Rhetoric that Charles references? Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to know it at all, since a five second google search would lead you to a one page book preview of Alan Brinton\u2019s Pathos and \u201cAppeal to Emotion\u201d: An Aristotelian Analysis, where he on that singular page immediately quotes Aristotle and his opinion of the use of pathos directly from the Rhetoric: In the first chapter of Bk. I of the Rhetoric, Aristotle complains that current rhetorical treatises place too much emphasis on influencing the emotions of hearers (\u201cjudges\u201d). \u201cThe arousing of prejudice, pity, anger, and similar pathe has nothing to do with the essential facts, but is merely a personal appeal to the man who is judging the case. (\u2026) It is not right to pervert the judge by moving him to anger or envy or pity\u200a\u2014\u200aone might as well warp a carpenter\u2019s rule before using it.\u201d Nothing new under the sun indeed, it seems that such rhetorical treatises have remained current for over two thousand years. In case you\u2019ve never heard of the eternal clash among the great speakers, there are two basic camps\u200a\u2014\u200athe sophists, the salesmen and politicians interested only in winning, and the philosophers (\u201clovers of wisdom\u201d), represented notably precisely by Aristotle. Now you may begin to see what irks me so much about Charles\u2019s article\u200a\u2014\u200awhat he did was twist Aristotle\u2019s words to serve the purposes of the sophists, his sworn enemies. Let\u2019s break down some of the exact Charles\u2019s words: You don\u2019t need logic to make people take action. Sure. You can just yell at them very loudly. Or shoot every tenth person until they comply. Or stage an impromptu puppet show to confuse them. The possibilities are endless! Let me offer a counterproposal\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe you do need logic at least sometimes to have people NOT take certain actions that are not in their own, or anyone\u2019s, best interest. And if it currently is so that people can be compelled into action by some sort of illogic, maybe it\u2019s not right that it is so, and doesn\u2019t have to, as well as shouldn\u2019t, remain so. In the interest of not mincing words, when someone tries to circumvent one\u2019s free will and better judgement by some sort of cheap and dirty argumentation trick, it\u2019s not persuasion, it\u2019s called deception or coercion. But let\u2019s read on: Logos is seasoning on the steak. It makes it taste better, but it\u2019s not a necessity. You know what, let me just quote Aristotle through Brinton again: \u201cSuch appeals (to emotion), he says, are mere \u201caccessories\u201d and not an essential part of rhetorical proof.\u201d Well, you don\u2019t get more spin that 180 degrees. I\u2019m beginning to think that Charles may actually be pulling a masterful prank. If he\u2019s serious, on the other hand, it is a sign that sometimes logos and the essential facts that come with it would better be involved in the making of one\u2019s argument in order to prevent having to consume a black bird that rhymes with \u201cJon Snow\u201d. Persuasion and salesmanship get a bad reputation. We associate it with liars, cheats and the ugly side of capitalism. The point being\u2026? But this isn\u2019t always the case. Oh, so there was no point. Not exactly a way to put people at ease by admitting there are significant harms in all but (presumably) few instances. But it\u2019s an honest and true statement, so, points for that, I guess. Persuasion is a tool, and tools are amoral. A childish side of me would like to say \u201c\u2026as is the author of this statement\u201d, and so it does. I suppose that on some fundamental level, one can use anything for anything\u200a\u2014\u200aknife to butter a toast, iron maiden to make lots of melon juice, or a nuke as a paperweight. Unfortunately, tools tend to be designed for a purpose and purposes can be all kinds of immoral, as is a mindset that sees language or humans as things to subvert and exploit. But there\u2019s no point in beating a dead horse any further. You may have noticed that my reasoning is not devoid of pathos, namely sarcasm, but it is logos first. You\u2019re not supposed to agree with me because I was made angry by an objectively infuriating set of statements, or because I may have been funny in my retorts. You\u2019re only supposed to agree with logic, and only the kind of logic that is able to stand against equally logical criticism. That is, if you care about the truth or wisdom, like the philosophers in the line of Aristotle. It is possible that my logic has not persuaded you, but if you can defend your disbelief with logic, you have all of my respect. If I have failed to persuade you on the grounds of logic, or if you agree with me based on anger or humor alone, it is not I who has a problem, and a problem you do have. Fortunately, it\u2019s a fixable problem, for the most part. But of course, the salesmen don\u2019t want to fix it, that would get in the way of exploiting it. Just like the world of computing has black hats, the world of the world has asshats, and step one in being able to defend one\u2019s own mind from appeals to emotion is to become aware of the fact that there are many people out there who are only interested in you doing what they want you to. Or you could have no emotions, but that would be a bit of an overkill. Let\u2019s stick to plan A. It\u2019s not so much that you should be paranoid, since it\u2019s not a secret at all\u200a\u2014\u200athe leading political and economic philosophy advises everyone to always act in their self-interest. Love of truth is not compatible with being self-interested. One interested in truth has to accept that they may be proven wrong and fail in persuasion. A person who is self-interested, like someone who aims to get rich, famous, or powerful, sees value in truth only when it moves him or her closer to those goals, and would do anything not to fail or be proven wrong. Therefore, the only situation in which a salesperson or a politician can and will actually help you is in a win-win situation where your interests align. The mutually beneficial nature of that situation should make itself completely explainable by logic. Typically, smart salesmen will use truth and logic when it serves their purposes, because why not\u200a\u2014\u200ait doesn\u2019t make their arguments any weaker. Which means that you need to be very skeptical precisely in a situation when emotional appeals and credentials are all that the salesmen are using. In all likelihood, that would happen when there\u2019s nothing else they can use, if they wish to avoid outright lying. There are of course much more complicated problems that would require treatises of their own and perhaps some training as well, like how to spot outright lies and half-truths, how to navigate personal biases, or how to deal with the constant pressure of advertisement. But the first step is simple\u200a\u2014\u200achange your default reaction from \u201ctrust everything everyone says\u201d to \u201ctry to keep calm and skeptical while others are pushing things on you\u201d. You may fail, everyone does at times, but it is the default unquestioning naivety of most people that makes appeals to emotion such a safe bet. Imagine the difference between a kid who hasn\u2019t been told that Santa doesn\u2019t actually exist, and a somewhat older kid that figured it out. The realization that you\u2019re likely being played, the un-suspension of disbelief, is literally half the battle, whatever your level of intelligence, education, or experience might be. In fact, don\u2019t just believe me right now. I\u2019m not interested in effective persuasion for its own sake. After all, I\u2019m not made any more right by the increasing number of people who might agree with me. Just don\u2019t believe people who\u2019d really, really, really want you to believe them, until they earn it with logos. Hello, I\u2019m Martin Rezny.Did you like this piece?
