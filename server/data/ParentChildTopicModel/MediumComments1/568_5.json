{"content": "Hi Amy, I don\u2019t know you but I can relate to this in a big way. As a Christian struggling with depression and living in a hypocritical society (the worst of them being fellow Christians), I am constantly battered by people\u2019s opinions and wishes of who I should be, rather than any genuine love for who I actually am. I also swear alot and though I know it may not be the best thing, that\u2019s where I am in my life right now. While many may not mean to, their words and attitudes wound us many times rather than uplift us. I am not perfect but I cannot be anything or anyone else (believe me I have tried). Neither can you so just do you and know that there are other misfits out there struggling alongside you. Be Blessed! ", "child": "", "name": "568_5", "parent": "568", "title": ""}
