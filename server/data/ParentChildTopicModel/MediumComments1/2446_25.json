{"content": "12 Who Knew Clients Didn\u2019t Pay\u00a0Bills? We work hard for our clients and since we\u2019re a boutique agency that specializes, that work can consume our time. Small means a small list of clients, too. A small list of clients translates to something else\u200a\u2014\u200acashflow issues. One thing I never realized in running a business was that other businesses simply ignore bills altogether or continuously pay them late. It\u2019s not just me, either. We don\u2019t talk about it in public\u200a\u2014\u200abut virtually all of my agency buddies tell a similar story. Clients that rack up months of debt, quit answering calls, lie about when the check is coming, and sometimes KNOW that they can\u2019t pay you but use you anyway. I even have one client who continues to hire people while not paying our invoice. It\u2019s sickening. And, since we\u2019re boutique, the shit rolls downhill. If I don\u2019t get paid, I\u2019m not able to pay our subcontractors. So\u2026 I have become the client who can\u2019t pay the bill. We\u2019re making changes to this now with new clients\u200a\u2014\u200aensuring that we get funding up front, stopping work on a dime, and communicating with our subcontractors\u2026 but it has been a real shocker to me that companies do this. Do you sue them? I think it would cost more for the attorney bills. And if you do sue them, would anyone want to work with you again? Don\u2019t get me wrong\u200a\u2014\u200aevery company has ups and downs. We have some clients that run into money problems but they communicate those to us well ahead of time and we\u2019re able to pause resources and keep the lights on. But those clients that just use and ignore you\u2026 I wish it was the old days where I could send my muscle over to just collect for us.
