{"content": "Hi Benjamin, thanks a lot\u200a\u2014\u200anot only for the article, but also for your insightful comments in the Responses section. I have been suffering from severe anxiety in the past and I can relate to almost everything written here. I\u2019ve thought about some of these points before. I guess some would say it\u2019s a form of victimizing yourself\u200a\u2014\u200alabelling yourself with \u201canxiety\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut I think its more a way of hiding from the world. Anxiety is really an identity crisis, and the label is an unhealthy way of defining who we are. Thank you for mentioning that sufferers should seek help. It is tempting to try to handle everything alone, as you say, but this becomes an impossible mission if you can\u2019t sleep or eat properly; it totally distorts the mind. Even indirect contact with society\u200a\u2014\u200abooks, friends, hobbies etc\u200a\u2014\u200ahelps put things into perspective by pushing you away from imaginary tensions and towards the real world. On a personal note, the \u201cyou are not alone\u201d heading resonated with me. This is what my boyfriend always tells me, and I\u2019m slowly starting to deeply appreciate that there are people that truly care about me, and us. This means the world! Once again, great article\u200a\u2014\u200aand thank you! ", "child": "", "name": "1718_9", "parent": "1718", "title": ""}
