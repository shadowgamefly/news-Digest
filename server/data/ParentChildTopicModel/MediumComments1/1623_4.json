{"content": "I didn\u2019t end up going out Friday night at all\u200a\u2014\u200abeen feeling non-social and finally indulged that whim\u200a\u2014\u200abut I did get my groceries done early ($50.78) and cleaned my room, which was MUCH overdue. Saturday I spent in the studio ($7.50 for coffee and doughnut). Headed home early; there was a block party on my street, and I picked up some food magnets ($2.50). Met up early with date cutie and got Softee and espresso ($5), then drinks which he paid for, then ramen which I paid for ($53). We headed back to my place and listened to the new Chance the Rapper mixtape (whiiiiich I\u2019m probably going to have to revisit today to actually determine whether I like it, let\u2019s be real). Dude and I caught brunch at Champs the next day ($26.77), and then parted ways. I cleaned my fridge and bought ros\u00e9 for clothing swap ($15.24). Some decent scores this time! Then I watched Lemonade [again] with the hostess and we chatted over mezcal. Then home in the semi-rain! Estimated $174, spent $160.79. A rare under-estimate weekend.
