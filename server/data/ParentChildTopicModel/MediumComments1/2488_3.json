{"content": "The present \u201cGOAL\u201d is to be able to store electrical energy for LESS than $100 per KW\u00a0? Is that not a miss-print\u00a0? Right now the local electric company charges me less than 12 cent per KW. But let\u2019s be honest about this, harnessing solar and wind to produce electricity is a great idea, BUT it is NOT re-newable, nor is it reliable, as it\u2019s only available when the Sun shines and the wind blows. Sun goes down and the wind stops. Beside the storage is expensive, as the article makes it clear. The US is blessed with a 1,000 year supply of coal, that is cheep energy. And to burn coal clean is simple. As carbon precipitates in water. So, do NOT pump emission up into the clouds. ", "child": "", "name": "2488_3", "parent": "2488", "title": ""}
