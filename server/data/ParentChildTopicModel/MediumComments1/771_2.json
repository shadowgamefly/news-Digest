{"content": "Maybe we are using different assumptions. If you claim that given a specific value for total elapsed time, any easing is better than no easing, then I don\u2019t disagree in principle (though I can argue for no ease-out in some cases). By \u201crepetitive easing\u201d I mean the situation where the first time you see slow-in, slow-out easing it\u2019s fun, and possibly supportive of usability by guiding your eye, but after the 100th time you\u2019re tired of waiting for the app to get moving, and especially to stop in the case of slow ease-out, so you can get on with it. First-time context is different than 100th-time context. I argue for subtle easing, bounce, etc. because they better serve continued use. ", "child": "", "name": "771_2", "parent": "771", "title": ""}
