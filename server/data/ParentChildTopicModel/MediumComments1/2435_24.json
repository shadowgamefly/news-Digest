{"content": "We all know some slackers at work. Good to hear it from your perspective. On leadership, it\u2019s easier being an effective leader when you have good intuition, a strong character, flexible, humble, and willing to admit mistakes. It also helps to research broadly, being open minded, keen to advice, and hire an incredible team. Here\u2019s to leaders:\u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They\u2019re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\u201d \u2015 Rob Siltanenhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8GiNGcXuM ", "child": "", "name": "2435_24", "parent": "2435", "title": ""}
