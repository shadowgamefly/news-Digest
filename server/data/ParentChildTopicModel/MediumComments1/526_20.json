{"content": "This is a great story. I spent 5 years living in China, and this might be a shocking statement, but it is in that country today where you will find the real Christianity of antiquity. Christian churches in China (run by Chinese not Western missionaries) under extreme persecution, go out of their way to provide support for people that have no other recourse under a totalitarian regime. In fact you could replace \u201cRome\u201d with \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d in your story about the plagues and it would fit EXACTLY. It is at house churches in China today where you will find a lot of these qualities of true Christianity still in existence. If, as you say, North American Christianity is dying, I wonder what a century of \u201cChinese Christianity\u201d might look like. ", "child": "", "name": "526_20", "parent": "526", "title": ""}
