{"content": "This is written in code, and some of it is just nonsense. This article basically addresses composition, but not well. For example, why can\u2019t you experiment with camera angles with a DSLR? Can my Canon only shoot at right angles? Of course not. Every camera and lens has its limitations, but what angle you hold it at is not one of them. Also, the iPhone is the worst example of a smart phone camera. It\u2019s the only smart phone camera which, out of the box, doesn\u2019t allow you to use manual settings, which is what gets you beyond snapshots into the meat and potatoes of great photography. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t get great photos without manipulating the exposure settings, but you certainly can master composition and edit right on the device without mad Photoshop or Lightroom skills.
