{"content": "\u201c The reader who expects worldbuilding is frequently the reader who expects fiction to have \u201canswers.\u201d The one who wants all mysteries to be solved, all stories to have \u201ca point,\u201d and all ambiguity to be swept under the rug.\u201d Thanks for the sweeping and condescending statement. People who like worldbuilding like a consistent world with consistent rules, because it makes things that break the rules, or that break from the consistency, all the more fantastic and interesting. Worldbuilding isn\u2019t endless facts and figures, that is only one facet of it, and a small one at that; it\u2019s building a coherent world that draws a reader in more deeply by creating a smooth immersion in which a reader finders themselves suspending disbelief more easily. Worldbuilding is not a bar to ambiguity, nor does a story set in a well built world need to have a \u201cpoint\u201d, nor does it mean all mysteries have to be solved because some strawman reader you imagined demands them.
