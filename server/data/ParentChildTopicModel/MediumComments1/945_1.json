{"content": "Nicely\u00a0done! However, I noticed that none of your tests include any bracketed expressions. Don\u2019t you think you should test if those work as expected too? Also, I\u2019m guessing the calculator won\u2019t work if you use an expression like (5*65) + 24, since this becomes 5*65* + 24. Was that\u00a0by\u00a0design? Also, regarding the writing of the article, I\u2019d suggest you limit your discussion of side issues (such as version control), so you can explain the actual solution in depth without the article getting too long. You can instead link to a relevant article (by yourself or someone else) explaining the peripheral issues. ", "child": "", "name": "945_1", "parent": "945", "title": ""}
