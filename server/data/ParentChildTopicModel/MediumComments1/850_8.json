{"content": "Your story resembles mine to a tee, Sophia! I grew up coding on Xanga, took a computer class but studied business because I also didn\u2019t feel like I had enough skills to major in computer science.

Good luck in your camp!!", "child": "", "name": "850_8", "parent": "850", "title": ""}
