{"content": "Hello there Sean, thank you for this beautiful article man. It\u2019s both invaluably inspirational and intelligent. My name is William and I\u2019m 21 years old; currently studying as an interior designer all the way in South Africa, and I\u2019ve managed to land myself an internship in one of the biggest (if not the biggest) interior design businesses in my local town and I, unsurprisingly, enjoy every moment I spend at the office as it is an environment I\u2019ve always dreamt of working in but now I have a problem. I was asked to create a website, which I did ever so well, for the business and it was the first time I\u2019ve ever had to do something so creative and exciting for anyone\u200a\u2014\u200alet alone myself before! And, inevitably, I\u2019ve gained an extensive comprehension and a few more skills along the journey and now I\u2019m caught up between a \u2018website or interior design space\u2019. I feel overwhelmed by the doors of opportunities that have opened up so wide for me and I simply do not know what to think anymore. I find it difficult to focus on two things at once because the more I concentrate on Web designing and development (which I\u2019m commended for) I get less time to focus on my own studies (which I\u2019m passionate about). You mentioned that \u2018as a designer you need to keep learning as much as you possibly can to stay relevant, now I know you\u2019re probably not some sort of designer life coach but I would really like to know how I can go about conquering the challenge that I\u2019m currently faced with in your perspective?
