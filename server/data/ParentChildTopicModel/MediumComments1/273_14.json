{"content": "Publishing a climate change denier now is beyond stupid. It is wilfully malicious. 10 yrs ago you could claim there was a debate. The debate is over. Anyone on the wrong side of the truth now is disturbed. We know people are already dying. We know many more people will die if nothing is done. The definition of homicide includes inaction.

To go further, and promote inaction, is wilful homicide. ", "child": "", "name": "273_14", "parent": "273", "title": ""}
