{"content": "Went for 2 hikes today. One was about 45 minutes up to a lookout. Had to change the batteries in the camera because I have been snapping like crazy! Second hike was also a good climb up, then descent to the Rio Grande Canyon! OH MY! I need another word for awesome! Across the river (maybe 200 metres) there was a Mexican singing in Spanish. A beautiful echo rang out in the canyon. We hiked a few more metres and came upon a cup with money in it and a request to pay the Spanish serenader whose name just happened to be Jesus! Still looking for Elvis!", "child": "", "name": "1222_1", "parent": "1222", "title": ""}
