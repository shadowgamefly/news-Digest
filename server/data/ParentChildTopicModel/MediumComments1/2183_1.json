{"content": "This is a great post Mac! As I was watching the final minutes of that game all I could think about was how do you approach this from a social media standpoint. They literally went from, \u201czero to one hundred real quick.\u201d I\u2019m not the biggest fan when teams just post dry, boring play-by-play tweets, but to go completely silent is tough not to notice. Not only did they have to handle the nasty issues on the field, they also had to deal with the fans at the game. You had fans throwing debris on the field, booing at Roethlisberger while being carted off the field, and they were multiple arrests/scuffles (involving both Steeler\u2019s and Bengal\u2019s fans) post game. So this just adds to the mess and makes it difficult to post a \u201cthank you fans\u201d graphic/post. When would be a good time to post that if its necessary? I am sure that the Bengals social media team had a great strategy in place if they were to lose but the events that took in place were so unexpected. I would be completely shell-shocked too especially if I was behind that twitter handle. I do agree that the Bengals account should have posted something at the end of that game regarding the final score. However, I do respect their decision and I\u2019m sure it was a higher level decision as well. I\u2019m still new to the #smsports industry but I\u2019m so interested in seeing how teams, colleges, brands, etc.. approach these kind of situations.
