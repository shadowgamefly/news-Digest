{"content": "I\u2019m not just finding parts of myself I\u2019d lost. There are parts of me I knew were there, but went ignored and neglected. Parts I either didn\u2019t think were worth developing, or didn\u2019t have to courage to develop. Parts I thought were weak, that I tried to cover up and hide.
