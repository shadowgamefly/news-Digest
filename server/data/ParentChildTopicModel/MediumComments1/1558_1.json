{"content": "6) I will allow good people to stay in my apartment for as long as they need to. Most of the local people in Istanbul close themselves off from foreigners (including Turkish people they don\u2019t know particularly if they aren\u2019t from where they are). I don\u2019t want to limit myself this way. Hospitality is nearly nonexistent in Istanbul (regardless of what travel guides say about the locals being known for being hospitable). Due to the political atmosphere and people not being happy with life in general, there\u2019s not really an inclination to be hospitable towards anyone foreign (as the government currently increases its hostile attitude towards foreigners). There\u2019s more of an inclination to stay away. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s not a nice feeling to hold onto that having any contact with a foreigner can somehow lead to danger at the hands of the government. It\u2019s a poor government for exercising an avoidance of foreigners and a poor mentality of the locals to follow what the government preaches out of fear (of course, there are most of those who follow out of loyalty). I like to think that as long as I know that I am doing the right thing then it\u2019s worth accommodating a good person.", "child": "", "name": "1558_1", "parent": "1558", "title": ""}
