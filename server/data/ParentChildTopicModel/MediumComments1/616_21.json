{"content": "See now, this is a gorgeous little post. I am always suspicious of titles which declare that they have tips or strategies for finding writing topics. More often than not they tend to be the same few ideas being rehashed in post after post by different authors. No doubt they are drawing inspiration from existing classic sources and/or each other. Desperation though leads me to check these out regardless of my doubts, and I end up disappointed, having already given these generic ideas many futile chances. This is perhaps the first time that I read one of these and actually came out feeling not cheated. Great post, and thank you for the concise and refreshing suggestion.
