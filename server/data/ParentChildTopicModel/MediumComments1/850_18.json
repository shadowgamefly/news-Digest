{"content": "Pardon my provocative question: why do (did) you concentrate so much on how do you feel w.r.t. people in the class and not on how do you feel about the subject? While I read your story, studying HTML/CSS then C++/Java I thought: \u201cthis woman does not need a boot camp, just a good book and spare time to practice\u201d. I started coding the same way. It really seems to me that is just comparing yourself to an idea you have of others that is stopping you (have you seen their code? Was it orders of magnitude better than yours?) If you decided to spend your free time on coding i think it doesn\u2019t mean you like coding. You love coding. Go for what you love, and don\u2019t care about others.
