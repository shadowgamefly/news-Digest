{"content": "Chris, what industries were you following? The industry, to me makes a difference. If the sales people from an industry is male dominated, then I would expect the women in sales in that industry to be of a better quality, thus advance the sales process and close more sales. Some of the previous answers discussed \u201ctrust\u201d as an element within the the sales cycle. Everyone, whether you are buying groceries or deciding on a multi-million dollar purchase, you experience an objection phase. Trusting the person (and company) you are purchasing from is the only way purchasing process is advanced. Thus, it\u2019s much more important to understand the prospect\u2019s pain than to sell your product/service until the discovery is completed. This being stated, by nature, women may be tuned to an empathetic approach, gain the trust and overcome objections, if they have shown credibility along the sales cycle and thus advance and close the sale. BTW, I\u2019ve seen as many women as men destroy a prospect\u2019s trust because they lacked the credibility, thus lack of trust in sales from my industry. Not all industries are suitable for all sales professionals. ", "child": "", "name": "926_18", "parent": "926", "title": ""}
