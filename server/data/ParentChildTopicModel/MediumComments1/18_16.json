{"content": "I understand the motivation to do so, but I\u2019m not sure you can back up that it\u2019s accurate to say that the quality of most movies actually rests in the middle of the graph since that would mean most movies are just barely above watchable. Wouldn\u2019t it be more likely that most movies are fine and mostly good entertainment and that it\u2019s actually more rare that a movie is only middling, which to a lot of people indicates that it might not actually be entertaining at all? As you noted, it\u2019s just a choice one has to make in such research, but it seems an odd choice and implies that you\u2019re intuiting your own personal view of most movies in place of some other less biased way of determining what the distribution should be. Wouldn\u2019t it be less prone to personal bias for you to do something like take the average of all possible review aggregators and then pick which distribution is closer to the average distribution (or something like this method)? I\u2019m not saying that would be the correct method, just that I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve actually justified that your chosen method was the right one. For instance you use this phrase \u201ca whole bunch of average ones\u201d to describe the bulk of movies and say that you can\u2019t even remember the plots of them anymore, but it\u2019s unclear why remembering the plot at an arbitrary time in the future would bear on the entertainment quality of a film at all since you can\u2019t determine whether you\u2019ll remember a film when you\u2019re reviewing it after having watched it for the first time. Even just checking each site\u2019s distribution against the cinemascore distribution might have less bias than your criteria do. I\u2019m just not sure you\u2019ve actually accomplished what you set out to do since your initial search criteria return inherently biased results.
