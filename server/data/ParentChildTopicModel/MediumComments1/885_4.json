{"content": "Thank you Tre. It\u2019s been a continuous struggle and I find myself growing and learning more about myself as well as my parents. We still have a very good relationship despite our differences. I\u2019m luckily that my parents raised me to be not only to be intellectually curious, but to be kind and understanding as well.
