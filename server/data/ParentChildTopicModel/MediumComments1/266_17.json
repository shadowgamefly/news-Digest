{"content": "They are still journalists with training, experience and knowledge. If they are finding it necessary to risk their cushy, well-compensated jobs it\u2019s for a good reason. To silence them would be to diminish our ability to evaluate our politicians and vote rationally. Hide your head in the sand if you wish, but don\u2019t shame those who aren\u2019t as cowardly as you. In a free country it is everybody\u2019s responsibility to discuss politics and try to become the most aware they can be of what is best for our country. Trying to suppress information and opinions of journalists is antithetical to a functioning democracy. Discussing whether a sportswriter, or anybody for that matter, has the \u201cright\u201d to discuss these important issues is missing the mark entirely. It is painfully obvious a journalist has not a right but a responsibility to report what they see and discuss potential implications: it\u2019s their duty as an American. Lamenting the \u201cend of stick to sports\u201d is nauseating and infuriating, missing the mark entirely. Why not lament the end of \u201ca full democracy\u201d as the EIU reported last week? This piece is one-sided, idiotic and anti-American. It\u2019s almost as bad as the piece that asshat Rany wrote saying we should have gone into some large scale ground war in Syria, ignoring the fact that we haven\u2019t had anything close to a successful invasion of a soverign nation in our nation\u2019s history. If I wanted right-wing lunatics I\u2019d be on Breitbart. Either make a statement or \u201cstick to sports\u201d. Don\u2019t drown out the voices of the righteous with your milquetoast waffling.
