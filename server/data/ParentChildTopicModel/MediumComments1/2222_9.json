There\u2019s also a lot of lean / agile writing about avoiding over-dependence on tools. The mindset is critical. The agile transformation of my group at GE was driven top-down and was also heavily (though not wholly) tool-centric. I suspect that tool provision is an easy thing for senior managers to tick off and monitor. The tools are a great help in providing an easy pathway to useful practices, but unless there\u2019s a significant extra push and spark from someone in terms ways of working on the ground, it\u2019s risks being for nothing. That spark can come bottom-up or middle-management-out, but probably not top-down\u200a\u2014\u200ait has to be *felt* locally. One area where I didn\u2019t see the transformation succeed (I\u2019ve left GE now) was in engineering\u2019s relationship with the wider business. There wasn\u2019t much agile or lean about that, sadly. Are there tools that can catalyse that? Thanks for the article. ", "child": "", "name": "2222_9", "parent": "2222", "title": ""}
