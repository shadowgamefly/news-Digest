{"content": "Great article. I have many agreements and couple of fundamentally different ideas. But you lay out your case nicely and provide much good background for the issues. Here\u2019s my response: Properly understood, by execs and boards of directors and even small entrepreneurs, the driving force of entrepreneurism is return on invested capital. This is different from mere profit. Especially in today\u2019s age of government favor, failure of legislation and enforcement, influence (a polite term for bribery), total unreality in interest rates and senior level of corporations colluding in reporting fake profits for bonuses and perks. The major source of moral hazard, I propose, is that the political system is not looking after basic morality. They create the conditions which have it make sense to take risks and have others bear the cost. Entrepreneurism is the exact opposite. Entrepreneurs take the risks and get the rewards or reap the penalties of failure. Still happens. But not at the level of large corporations and conglomerates. Were the execs and businesses acting \u201crationally\u201d? Certainly on some scale they were. Just shows how slippery the term rational is. Early uses of the term entrepreneurship used something like, \u201cto coordinate productive elements to produce more value for resources used that others in the marketplace.\u201d I can work with this. Because, with free market prices as the measure of using resources better I can trust what happens if the rules of the game are as they should be. Like morally or, better, constitutionally. You quote Baumol, \u201cpersons are ingenious and creative in finding ways that add to their own wealth, power and prestige\u201d. Within a market place bounded by moral law, this is what I\u2019d expect. Remember, I use return on invested capital, not just profit or income as my standard. What are you going to do with you capital? I am not an apologist for entrepreneurs. And I\u2019m pretty much resigned and disappointed about government involvement in all this. I do like the \u201cbad entrepreneurship\u201d phrase. My economics teacher in high school (50+ years ago) referred to this as \u201cthe production of ilth\u201d as opposed to the production of wealth. Not bad for a beginning education in economics as a teenager! A very subjective assessment standard\u200a\u2014\u200abut a wonderful introduction to value economics. The rules of the game should be set produce growth of the whole, but not favor any particular entrepreneur or participant in the market place. But now we\u2019re deep into the mess. The rules of the game are horribly slanted in favor of some over others. But it\u2019s much worse than that. The rules and enforcers can be bought. Many corruption indexes of countries count bribery highly. But somehow, all the stuff that goes on in America and other \u201cdemocracies\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d countries doesn\u2019t register on the bribery scales. Maybe the result of bribery? A major area of concentration of wealth, of the ability to buy shares without needing to add value to what was bought, and to fake profits is that our money has no integrity left. I won\u2019t go into why, at least here, but I\u2019ll give you a tip off that it\u2019s so. It is nothing creative use of language to has \u201cnegative interest rates\u201d. They haven\u2019t existed in the history of the world. I\u2019m not talking about negative real rates which are those which are lower than the rate of inflation. I\u2019m talking absolute rates. Notice that these negative rates don\u2019t apply to you and I. The rates that I see are near the highest they\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve saved the best for last as, fortunately, Mr. Allworth did as well. I think his introduction of \u201cdemocratic ideals\u201d points at the key place. But not in the way that he seems to be presenting it. He says that the heart of the problem is prioritize democracy. This needs to be delved into more deeply than I can do here, but I\u2019ll try to make a different case with enough traction to provide an interest in pursuing it further. The problem can be said to be the prioritization of democracy. The smaller the social organization, the more applicable is democracy. The larger the social organization, the worse democracy gets. The more complex things are they worse democracy gets. The main problem in this article, I think, is that democracy is implied to equate with \u201cthe people\u201d. Pure democracy has been characterized as the situation where two wolves and one sheep vote on what to have for dinner. My ideal for social systems, which I\u2019m pretty sure are similar to Mr. Allworth and most Americans, is a system that provides the greatest long term benefits to the greatest number of people. People that is there is opportunity for all and the great majority of people benefit over time. Not equally as that isn\u2019t in nature, but to a significant degree for the vast majority. How shall this occur? Through a constitution and/or laws that are designed to protect the whole from violation of their rights the thought, speaking and actions that do not harm others. The best part of this article was the picture worth a thousand words of the United Airlines fiasco. Actually the most telling part of corporate America was the response of the CEO of UA. Who start with \u201cwho?Us?\u201d, to a pathetic \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d to increasingly greater responsible statement because the previous on. This was the kind of apology a violent criminal makes at sentencing time. You know. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Of course they\u2019re sorry (and the CEO UA the same). They are sorry that they were caught and that they\u2019re going to pay. If that CEO isn\u2019t fired, we know absolutely that it reflects the corporate culture. Real profit, measured by return on invested capital, is incredibly important to any company. But the interests of the company and the interests of the executives and financiers are miles apart. Many will have their millions in bonuses collected and manage to leave the company before facing the music. ", "child": "", "name": "783_15", "parent": "783", "title": ""}
