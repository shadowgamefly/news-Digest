{"content": "Love your selection! I also use Duolingo for learning French! Last year, I started using Trello, Headspace and Product Hunt. I use Trello in combination with Todoist to improve my productivity (my suggestion). I didn\u2019t know Smartcasual but I\u2019ll give it a try, though I\u2019m not sure if it will be very useful for me, living in a little town in Spain. It\u2019s too new, perhaps. I would add to your list an app that works as a base app for the rest: Coach.me. It\u2019s the best app out there for tracking all your goals in one place, very necessary to keep ourselves accountable with New Year\u2019s resolutions. You can use it only for tracking your new habits on your own, you can also get the support of the community, and you can even hire a coach at a truly affordable price, in case you need some extra professional accountability. Having an accountability partner can really make the difference. ", "child": "", "name": "1874_3", "parent": "1874", "title": ""}
