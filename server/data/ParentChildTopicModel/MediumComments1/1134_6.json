{"content": "Some years ago, I voted for a proposition in California that required that eggs sold in the state come from chickens that had been given a certain amount of living space (not exactly free-range, was my understanding, but much better than the typical cramped cages). After it passed, the price of the cheapest eggs shot up to over $3/dozen, then stabilized around $2. My family eats tons of eggs; I usually buy three dozen at a time. I hope the law helped the chickens. ", "child": "", "name": "1134_6", "parent": "1134", "title": ""}
