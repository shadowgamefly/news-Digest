{"content": "We don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s the hardest thing to talk about. People spend so much energy trying to keep the black holes in their lives a secret, but now all of mine is spent trying to survive. When I came out of the closet about being diagnosed with type II Bipolar Disorder, an Internet troll mocked me: \u201cmy mental illness makes me special.\u201d Instantly he confirmed my lifelong fear \u2014 the fear of my feelings being bad! I felt discredited and patronized. And, even worse, the fear of people accusing me of seeking some sort of special treatment or pity. I don\u2019t want your pity. I want the respect of being listened to. I\u2019ve put too much time and money into self-care for you to doubt my diagnosis, or worse, belittle it.", "child": "", "name": "321_5", "parent": "321", "title": ""}
