{"content": "Excellent news. Not for you, for me! I want everyone to know that I MADE Ellie Guzman on Medium. Why, when I first found her she was writing under a rock and had something like -5 followers. I noticed her talent right away. I can spot talent, and while it\u2019s true that my first comment on any of her posts was, \u201cU millennials R DUMB; GET OFF MY LAWN\u201d\u2026 it was obviously \u201cironic\u201d, and after I made it SHE BLEW UP. So, to recap: Ellie didn\u2019t get herself a job at Dreamworks. I got her a job at Dreamworks. OK, OK\u2026 before you write the angry missive about how I\u2019m always trying to take credit for other people\u2019s accomplishments, especially women and people of color\u2026 I\u2019ll admit that there is probably some white guy at Dreamworks that should get some of the credit too, but fuck him. And Ellie. Without Ellie being Ellie this wouldn\u2019t have happened, so I\u2019ll give her that. Thanks Ellie! You made my day! ", "child": "", "name": "611_4", "parent": "611", "title": ""}
