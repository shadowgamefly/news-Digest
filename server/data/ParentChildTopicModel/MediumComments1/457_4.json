{"content": "\u201cDonald Jr. admits there is no barrier between President Trump and his businesses\u201d then later you write, \u201c hough he said he didn\u2019t discuss the details of either business or the government with his father\u201d And your big shocker is that a few weeks ago Trump Jr said he hasn\u2019t been speaking to his father but now he says that in the last few weeks he has spoken to him more? That makes sense. He wants to play golf at the course in Scotland? Oh my God, the horrors of that. The only thing that you wrote of any substance is the fact that Eric is still updating him every few weeks on how things are going. ", "child": "", "name": "457_4", "parent": "457", "title": ""}
