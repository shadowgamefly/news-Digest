{"content": "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I hate those words. They don\u2019t say nearly enough. But they\u2019re really all you can say. The immensity of the loss of a loved one is too big for words. Thank you for putting your grief into words. \u201cHow to not have to write a\u00a0eulogy.\u201d How, indeed. I wish I knew. We\u2019re mortal beings. We die. Learning to deal with that inescapable fact is hard. Many people propose simplistic solutions every time someone dies too young.

Good luck with your hard lesson. And many blessings. ", "child": "", "name": "2461_17", "parent": "2461", "title": ""}
