{"content": "You would have been much better off with a disclaimer admitting that there was room for mistakes in your and Parcells\u2019 criteria instead of trying to write Tebow off because \u201che excelled as a runner and not a thrower.\u201d The fact of the matter is that he excelled at both in college and fit your criteria almost to a tee when he was coming out. Tebow: 66% completion percentage, 88 TD\u2019s to 16 INTS. 9.3 yards per attempt. Watson: 67% completion percentage, 90 TD\u2019s to 32 INTS. 8.4 yards per attempt. I\u2019m not in any way saying that Watson is comparable to Tebow, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s better to admit the flaws in your criteria than to make a false statement to write a guy off. It would actually add more credibility in your argument if you address the outliers directly instead of making stuff up about them. ", "child": "", "name": "2004_21", "parent": "2004", "title": ""}
