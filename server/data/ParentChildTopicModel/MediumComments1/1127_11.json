{"content": "I'll use the Google rule here: There is a school in Denmark that teaches students all this. It's called Kaospilot (http://www.kaospilot.dk) and they teach in English. They offer the education we all need to succeed in life and which I wish I could have had 25, 20 or even 15 years ago. BTW, I don't work for them and I receive no compensation for recommending them either. Hope this helps. Good luck! ", "child": "", "name": "1127_11", "parent": "1127", "title": ""}
