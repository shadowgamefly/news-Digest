{"content": "Am glad you liked the article Adam! And I think its simply awesome what you are doing. 4 years of undergrad, 2 years of Masters, and 3 of PhD and I still feel that the most important thing that I learnt was way back in the fourth or fifth grade. If only it had been taught properly. Academia always lags behind in that sense. I appreciate that you are trying to fill the gap.
