{"content": "One practical truth and two absolute truths to make a case: At some point in (nearly) every article on every site or every conversation on every\u200bchannel, some version of this sentence is written/said: \u201cWe all know Lebron is the best player in the league.\u201d This is widely accepted even by those who are voting for someone else.Lebron plays more efficiently and has a greater impact per minute on the quality of the play of his team (see his ridiculous on/off numbers along with his TS% and other numbers mentioned in article).Lebron plays more minutes than anyone else. One player is regarded as the best, makes the biggest impact on his team, and plays the heaviest minutes. Somehow, he is mainly relegated to the 3rd or even 4th spot in the conversation. We are taking this man for granted, and it is kind of a shame. ", "child": "", "name": "25_14", "parent": "25", "title": ""}
