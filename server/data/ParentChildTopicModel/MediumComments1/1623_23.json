{"content": "On Friday I did not pick up stuff to make tacos because I didn\u2019t want to go to the store so instead we ordered in Chinese food ($18/each) and relaxed. Saturday I got breakfast after BF went to work ($8) and then finished hand-sewing the binding to a quilt and watched a lot of TV and started reading the Marie Kondo book. My allergies really kicked in and I wanted to die so I went to CVS for medication and frozen pizza and diet coke ($23.50). Sunday we got up early to go see an apartment in Malden. Oh. My. God. It was the worst place I\u2019ve ever seen. There were shuttle buses on the orange line (yet another reason not to live in Malden) so we ended up ubering there and back ($10/each). This place was filthy and tiny and super broken down and the broker was like \u201cit\u2019s actually in pretty good shape!\u201d before we went in but it wasn\u2019t. it wasn\u2019t at all. We were both pretty traumatized. We got dunks ($9) and then went back to bed until he had to go to work. I went to this little boutique down the street and spent $25 on candles because I couldn\u2019t get the smoke or cat piss smell out of my head from the Malden apt. I napped some more and then ordered in this chicken pasta dish that I\u2019ve been obsessed with lately ($19). I need to go grocery shopping like nobody\u2019s business. I feel gross from all the convenience food and poorer than I should be right now. Estimated $50 but obviously spent $112.50 ", "child": "", "name": "1623_23", "parent": "1623", "title": ""}
