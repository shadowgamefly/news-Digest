{"content": "Dear mr / senator McCain I personally didn\u2019t read a word of your article for the simple reason that it would be a waste of my time\u00a0. You have in the past few weeks shown by action rather than the banal words above that you are spineless and that those who gave you a military medal were mistaken to honor your alleged bravery\u00a0. You sir have nothing to lose\u00a0, you will not be president and you will not win another election because you will be swept out when the anger against the orange one spills over\u00a0. Take a stand be a man\u00a0. Take a stand have principles\u00a0. I know you have no principles now because you voted to confirm all the most inept and unqualified candidates chief of whom is betsy Devos\u00a0. You also voted for Mr Mnuchin who could conveniently forget an inconvenient source of wealth\u00a0. For now I will say goodbye\u00a0. Write us again when u grow a pair\u00a0.
