{"content": "I am a lady and currently make about $25k more than my husband. At one point in our courtship, before we were married, he made $35k more than me. Back then he paid my portion of rent and utilities for a month so I could travel for graduate school. Now I contribute a higher percentage toward living costs. We use our money to take care of ourselves and each other and we say thank you a lot. It\u2019s nice. Highly recommend. ", "child": "", "name": "2451_2", "parent": "2451", "title": ""}
