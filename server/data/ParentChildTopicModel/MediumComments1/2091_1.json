{"content": "Really wonderful share needed so badly in our society today. THANK YOU! I\u2019m an entrepreneur who gets asked ALL the time how I will give up my work (which I love) so I can have a family! EEWWW, why do they think it\u2019s my only option? Why can\u2019t I \u201cdo\u201d family like I\u2019ve done everything else in my life: with zeal and positivity refusing to get into a box made by others, instead building my own life to fulfill the joy. Your words rang true to me and I\u2019m so grateful. Thank you for you sharing your heart and being a voice for me and so many others! ", "child": "", "name": "2091_1", "parent": "2091", "title": ""}
