{"content": "Protests Help Send a Message While our Government Can\u2019t or\u00a0Won\u2019t  I agree with much of what\u2019s here but disagree on one CRITICAL point: Photos of protests seen around the world and in the States help Muslims here and overseas know that the American people are not monolithically interested in bombing and then banning them. They serve as a powerful tool against ISIS recruiting abroad and among those seeing family subjected to sudden, targeted, seemingly nonsensical airport detentions. Ultimately, that helps keep our troops safe overseas and serves our long-term interests as a nation. Please don\u2019t ever underestimate that. Foreign relations normally fall under the job of the US Government and State Department in particular, but we have some voids in those places right now.
