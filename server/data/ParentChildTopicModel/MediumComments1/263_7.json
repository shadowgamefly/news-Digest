{"content": "Yeah, I was a little meh when I started reading, then I read the guy from Jacobin describe the magazine as a critique of neoliberalism (because what\u2019s more important during the Trump Presidency than criticizing Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton for not being reflexively anti-capitalist?). Then, I got a taste of the article which seems to be arguing that being a bigger a*ole then then other person will magically make the world a better place. I expect these people to form some political clique that criticizes everything and accomplishes nothing. When people disagree with them, they\u2019ll probably become more and more convinced of their own superiority (and, of course, the stupidity of everyone else). I really hope that they don\u2019t become mainstream and they can talk amongst themselves in coffee houses or on Twitter. I\u2019d also love to know how many of these people voted.
