{"content": "Monroe has been rejuvenated by a move to the bench, where he has been given the freedom to anchor the second-unit offense and not do as much on defense. Last season, the Bucks tried to integrate the lumbering Monroe into an aggressive scheme that asked their big men to hedge and recover on screens past the 3-point line. They weren\u2019t forcing a square peg through a round hole so much as through a hole that didn\u2019t even exist. But Monroe is playing closer to the basket this year, and the Bucks are funneling penetration to him rather than asking him to move his feet in space.", "child": "", "name": "105_1", "parent": "105", "title": ""}
