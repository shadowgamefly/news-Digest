{"content": "I went through the opposite path. I fully accepted my identity as an anxious person. Like someone has to accept diabetes. Once it became part of me and determined my do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, I felt relieved. Eventually I built my confidence in accepting my self fully, anxiety included. It is importat to emphasize: I am not my illness. I have an illness. And by denying my illness I am lying to myself. When I embraced that I am anxious I started the healing process. And now I am really good, knowing when my panic attacks overwhelm me, it will pass. And one more thing. It really helped me that I started to write on Medium so I can help people with their mental problems. It helps them, it helps me. Thank you for sharing your experience.
