{"content": "I\u2019ve been saying this for quite awhile now. Each and every time ANYONE pays attention to these media whores, they get another \u2018boost\u2019 to their ratings.

For someone\u2019s own mother to \u2018shop\u2019 around her daughter\u2019s sex tape, in order to create some sort of income for the family, where does this belong in society? Look what it got us for a president, Commander Combover. Enough said, they can\u2019t disappear fast enough in my opinion. ", "child": "", "name": "1724_7", "parent": "1724", "title": ""}
