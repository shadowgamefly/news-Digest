{"content": "Young Mr. Gaetz appears not to have been born before 1970 when EPA was created due to the impressive failure of States to get a handle on pollution that was pervasive, unhealthy, obnoxious, and obvious for all to see. It has taken 47 years of hard work at the Federal, State, local, enterprise and personal level to greatly improve conditions. While childrens\u2019 blood lead levels have been drastically improved, millions of new jobs have been created, GDP has more than doubled, Ag production has increased, and so on. But the job of protecting public health and the environment isn\u2019t done. There are new problems emerging with new technologies and some problems that the laws enacted in the 1970s (with bipartisan support, remember that?) have not been effective in controlling. Will conditions improve or deteriorate under this simplistic proposal? Are individual states positioned to deal with the next Volkswagen fraud? Climate change? Will states offer environmental concessions to attract investment as they do with tax concessions? Do pesticide manufacturers want to go to 50+ state and territorial capitols to get sophisticated health and safety data reviewed and obtain a seal of approval, or would they rather have a single approval mechanism? In the words of the POTUS, this bill is Sad. ", "child": "", "name": "1064_22", "parent": "1064", "title": ""}
