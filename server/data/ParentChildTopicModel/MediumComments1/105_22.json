I\u2019m sure the coaching staff made it clear to the team to always go 3 for 3 from beyond the arc in a two minute stretch at the end of each game to help go on a 13\u20130 run against the #2 ranked defense in the league. Make sure to write notes in your game plan: \u201cKelly Olynyk to steal the ball from Stephen Curry, inspiring the Warriors to commit four turnovers during said run.\u201d Oh, and don\u2019t forget to make sure Curry and Thompson and Green to shoot a combined 5 for 23 on threes. Brad Stevens is one of the best coaches in the league, but the Warriors came back from playing five games in eight days on the road, during which they lost Durant. They are now 2\u20134 since his injury, but will rest their four best players on the tail end of another back-to-back road trip ending in San Antonio. These are all parts of a blueprint over which teams have absolutely no control, as evidenced by the arbitrary way the Celtics lost by 20 to mighty Denver the next game and are now in third place in the Easter Conference.
