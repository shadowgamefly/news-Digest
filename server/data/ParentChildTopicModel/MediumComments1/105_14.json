{"content": "Not sure if you guys caught the entire Raps\u200a\u2014\u200aPels game, but the Boogie gif you posted (him lumbering up the court for an awkward, forced layup with the grace of a drunk Vlade Divac) was a perfect snapshot of his performance: he\u2019s an inefficient black hole who takes ill-advised shots and struts around like he\u2019s a young Shaq. Reality check Boogie: you shot 35% and got eaten alive by Jonas Valanciunas, who played in the 4th quarter for the first time in weeks. Can you give it a rest with this dude? He\u2019s not tortured, he\u2019s not interesting, he\u2019s insufferable. Every time he duffs a layup he stalks the court like a starving polar bear, finds the nearest referee, pins him down, and takes a dump on his chest. Can you imagine playing pickup with Boogie? He\u2019s 100% the dude who sucks the life out of a perfectly good run with a billion ticky-tack foul calls and manages to stay on court all afternoon because he yells louder than everyone else.
