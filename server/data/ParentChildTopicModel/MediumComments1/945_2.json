{"content": "Wow, thanks for spotting that error. I try a lot not to get to deep into other topics but I felt that I needed to give something simple and detailed enough to keep the flow so readers don\u2019t get confused about what something means.

Thanks. ", "child": "", "name": "945_2", "parent": "945", "title": ""}
