{"content": "With all the problems of this world, these guys are spending billions on going to Mars and living to 200. WTF? And then we have Mark Andreessen, who happily pushed his \u201csoftware eats the world\u201d paradigm on Disney\u2019s Bob Iger. In Andreessen\u2019s magical world, the laws of supply and demand have been revoked, and the proliferation of millions of hours of mediocre video on You Tube has no effect on the economics of the quality content that Disney produces. In 1982 the economist Carl Shapiro noted that we move towards an equilibrium that makes \u201crelatively mediocre products ubiquitous in a free market.\u201d Somehow Andreessen does not understand the basic economics of TV production. The fact that as FX\u2019s John Landgraff has recently noted \u2014 \u201cthere is too much TV\u201d \u2014 we now produce 400 dramatic series per year instead of the 200, from just 5 years ago. Each one of these series has a relatively fixed cost of production (unlike reality TV) and so with such a proliferation, the possibilities of a $400 million syndication windfall on the order of a Seinfeld or Friends is an impossibility.", "child": "", "name": "1345_2", "parent": "1345", "title": ""}
