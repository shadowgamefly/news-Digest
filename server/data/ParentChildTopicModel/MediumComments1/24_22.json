{"content": "Bill Simmons, everyone! Spends 2000 words building a great case for Russell Westbrook to be MVP even as he\u2019s trying to undermine it, then distills it down to two things no one thinks it should be based on and picks someone else. \u201cIt was ridiculous to say Jordan\u2019s ballhogging didn\u2019t make his team better\u2026Russell Westbrook\u2019s ballhogging doesn\u2019t make his team better!\u201d \u201cA superstar is automatically worth 45 wins,\u201d several paragraphs after talking about how we need to rescue Anthony Davis, who has reached 45 wins once in his five-year career. By all means, let\u2019s ignore the league scoring leader and guy who averaged a triple-double, the guy you actually want to watch play every night. After all, guys who play key roles in playoff series ALWAYS become dominant for full seasons. Just ask Tristan Thompson, Matthew Dellavedova, Bismarck Biyombo, etc. Obviously the fact that the Rockets' offense does just fine without Harden needs to be ignored. We\u2019ll ignore that getting rid of Dwight Howard is always good for team morale. It\u2019s critical that we praise our good friend Daryl Morey\u2019s guy. BTW, Houston has the same zero chance to win a championship. Dont delude yourself otherwise. ", "child": "", "name": "24_22", "parent": "24", "title": ""}
