After developing a page that was displayed on a 9600 x 3240 single 1.0 dpi resolution screen, EM\u2019s and REM\u2019s made it much easier to scale certain content. I did try it first with PX breakpoints but in the end sass and rem-calc functions made it easier to work with. But all that said a nice article and some good points to think about.
