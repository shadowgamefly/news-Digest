{"content": "Suggestions for Medium\u2019s membership program I think Mike brought up great points about Medium\u2019s current status quo with the membership program. I personally didn\u2019t join the membership for several reasons and none of them have to do with the fact that I have to pay for it. I would have gladly paid for it if it had the benefits that I wanted. But just like Mike said, Medium\u2019s current membership doesn\u2019t really provide any \u201cpremium\u201d benefits. I have a couple of suggestions, although this might only apply to me. For \u201cfounding members\u201d you can perhaps give them the benefit to put more than 5 tags on posts. Or just anything that is different. (And of course keep the halo but\u2026 like\u2026. a halo isn\u2019t enough.)Make sure that the members-only email is different from the Medium Daily Digest. Please personalise and cater those emails, or at least let us filter the ones that we don\u2019t want to read. Because when I come to Medium, I don\u2019t come to get news, to be honest. I come to read people\u2019s insights, thoughts and experiences. I know that Medium has plenty of \u201cnews outlets\u201d but honestly I just avoid those, at least on here.(This suggestion isn\u2019t for just membership but) Please make this platform friendly for all creators, not just 1) columnists 2) essayists 3) news. If Medium truly wants to be the \u201cnew YouTube for writers\u201d you kind of have to realise that an independent platform like this will not only be out news. I was posting my fictional stories here a while ago but I just deleted them because they weren\u2019t a) getting any views compared to my other content b) it just seemed a bit\u2026 awkward to be posting that content on here. And that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Anyways that\u2019s it for now I really like this platform and honestly I only believe that it is going to get better since (unlike YouTube) Ev Williams actually seems to listen to the creators on here and reads what they think. Please keep it that way. ", "child": "", "name": "1209_4", "parent": "1209", "title": ""}
