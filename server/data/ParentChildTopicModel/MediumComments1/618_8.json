{"content": "Kevin, I don\u2019t know my next step with this publication. I\u2019m going to continue to run contests and hopefully if we can garner more sponsor start rewarding writers for posting on a continuing basis. I feel it\u2019s only fair. I\u2019ve also been thinking of trying to come up with a way to help kids get published on here. I\u2019m reaching out to local schools, libraries, and friends on line to see if they know of some kids that may like the idea? Who knows maybe I can help find some great young authors?
