{"content": "Read me out: if we assume KenPom gives up La Bestest rankings, Titus (and YouTube, Dronicus), a North Korea-made South Korea-exported faux Navajo novelty blanket from Tess & Pepe Boil\u2019s Horned Toad World & Tourist Emporium could cover every Wildcat, Duck and Bruin, the only fauna worth seriously considering for the impending Madness. And the dimensions of said blanket are narrower than what Jeff Sagarin allocates to home advantage, even leaving aside that KenPom\u2019s measuring stick is narrower than Sagarin\u2019s. So ultimately, isn\u2019t the manner in which Oregon dynamited AZ last Saturday versus how the Bruins basted the Ducks last night are really just displays of the twists & turns from lamp posts along the road to the destination, than truly revealing quantum CBB? Isn\u2019t how a CBB unfolds more like a nearly arbitrary stringing together of individual collisions of hadrons versus the picture produced from graphing kabillions of such collisions onto the same paper? Each of the WCC bullies, Gonzaga and St. Mary\u2019s, has a more impressive KenPom standing than ANY of Arizona, Oregon & UCLA. On the other hand, we\u2019d need at least 3 blankets from Tess & Pepe\u2019s to cover up the difference between the Zags and Gaels. So which will draw more eyes: GU winning at Moraga, or how it LOOKED closer/further apart than result? ", "child": "", "name": "1998_6", "parent": "1998", "title": ""}
