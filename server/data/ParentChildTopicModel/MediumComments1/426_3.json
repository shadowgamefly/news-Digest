{"content": "The United States is complicit in the colonization of the West Bank. We need to cut off aid to Israel. They take our money, spit in our faces, and dare us to do anything. If they want to build colonies on conquered territory, we shouldn\u2019t be helping pay for it. Face it.

Apartheid. Shame on them. ", "child": "", "name": "426_3", "parent": "426", "title": ""}
