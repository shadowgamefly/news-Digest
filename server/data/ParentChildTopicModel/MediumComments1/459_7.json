Now, that\u2019s a matter of custom, not of law, but a good custom, nonetheless. Moreover, as we continue to see, we do have probable cause of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours,\u201d not mere suspicion. If the current Congress were forced to break its conspicuous and egregious silence on this issue, would they do the right thing and commence impeachment proceedings? Or (more likely) would they continue show their true colours and expressly consent to his whole profiteering scam of our highest office, since that\u2019s what they do every day? What I\u2019d like to know is, how much is every red thug in Congress getting paid by the Trump organisation to play in his house of cards? What kind of threats and bribes are they getting from the President to make them so egregiously complicit in his violations of the constitution, established custom, and basic human decency? Are they simply that blindly loyal to the Republican brand? I\u2019m not sure. We need to force their hands and make it a 2018 election issue.
