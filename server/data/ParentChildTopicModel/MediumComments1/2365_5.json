{"content": "Bad networking is overrated. Good networking is underrated. Unfortunately, many people don\u2019t know what good networking looks like, so everything they associate with the word \u201cnetworking\u201d is bad, and that\u2019s where you get statements like \u201cnetworking is overrated.\u201d For me, networking includes talking to people, making connections, building relationships, and everything else about interpersonal interaction. I would even go so far as to include one-way \u201cinteraction\u201d as networking, that is, activities like reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. The only way I could not network with others would be to live in the woods, with no contact to civilization or society. ", "child": "", "name": "2365_5", "parent": "2365", "title": ""}
