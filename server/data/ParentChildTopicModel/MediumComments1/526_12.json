{"content": "\u201cWe no longer pay for pagan burials\u201d. \u201cWe accuse everyone but ourselves on social media.\u201d We, we, we, all the way home. Mr. Sledge, don\u2019t you know the old proverb about change? \u201cChange starts with \u2018I\u2019\u201d! Whenever you find yourself writing long statements about what \u201cwe\u201d are doing wrong then try this experiment: Replace the first-person plurals with first person singulars. If you\u2019re not just as filled with gusto to say \u201cI accuse others on social media but not myself\u201d then you\u2019re just using \u201cwe\u201d as a way to hide what you\u2019re really doing: pharisaical virtue signalling. It\u2019s an easy trap to fall into: It\u2019s hard to say \u201cYou guys accuse everyone but yourselves!\u201d, so people cushion it by saying \u201cwe\u201d. But the unspoken premise is that, as the one making the indictment, the messenger is more morally aware and thus exempt. It\u2019s like that old saying \u201cWhenever you find yourself saying \u2018someone should\u2019 replace \u2018someone\u2019 with \u2018I\u2019 and see if it still seems so important and worth doing\u201d ", "child": "", "name": "526_12", "parent": "526", "title": ""}
