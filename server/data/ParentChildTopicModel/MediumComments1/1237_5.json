{"content": "K.E. Kimball, When I\u2019m critiquing, I like to keep a few things in mind: The most important thing for poets to understand is how their poems made me feel. It\u2019s the best clue I can give them as to whether they\u2019re achieving what they set out to achieve. So I include my reader reactions: \u201cThis part slowed me down; I stumbled over the words.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m racing through these words and my heart is racing, too.\u201d Or \u201cThis is where I started sobbing.\u201dI acknowledge that I\u2019m working with a draft, not an assessment piece. It may have had many, many revisions already, but it\u2019s not the finished work. I assume the poet wants a helpful critique, and wants the piece to reach its potential.I don\u2019t actually know what poets are trying to achieve unless they tell me. So I never assume that they were trying to do one thing or another. I ask. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you were trying to give this a noir feel, but I certainly got a sense of it. If you\u2019d like to develop that aspect further, you could look at adding some darker language into lines 3\u20135.\u201dEven when they\u2019ve told me what they\u2019re trying to do, I never assume I know the details of it. Poets play with form, with words, with punctuation, and it\u2019s just as likely to be a deliberate choice as a typo. Or maybe I\u2019ve missed the metaphor or deliberate homonym. Who knows. So their alphabet is out of order in their abecedarian? They might have done it on purpose. \u201cThe alphabet goes X, Y, Z but you\u2019ve used Z, Y, X. I found this amusing, but I wasn\u2019t sure it worked well given the serious nature of the rest of your poem.\u201dIf something is unclear, I ask. Maybe their writing is perfectly clear, and it\u2019s my reading that\u2019s flawed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure whether to read this as a promise, or a threat. Perhaps you intended to leave it ambiguous\u200a\u2014\u200aI liked that effect. But if you wanted to take it more one way or the other, consider preceding it with slightly more positive/negative language.\u201dI thank the poet for the knowledge and awareness I take away from the experience of critiquing their work, and I share my discoveries with them.I acknowledge where my past experiences have probably affected my reaction to the piece. For example, I have a personal history of abusive relationships, and I would explain that as a reason why I feel frustrated when abuse is depicted in a way that doesn\u2019t seem authentic.I share opportunities with no expectation the poet will want to take me up on it. \u201cAround here, I desperately wanted to hear more about this man, and I was disappointed when you moved on. That said, I also kept reading to see if there was more further down. So it could go either way.\u201dI always point out the magical moments, the a-ha! moments, the unusual images, the little turns of phrase that take my breath away. I don\u2019t want poets to kill those darlings under any circumstances. If they don\u2019t belong in the poem, I want them to nurture those words elsewhere and grow a fresh poem around them. Pretty much all of these ideas are centred on the idea that I am not an expert in \u201call forms of poetry including this very specific poem this other poet was trying to create today\u201d. I say that as someone who has studied poetry extensively, holds a masters degree in writing, and works as a professional editor, so I think it would take a fairly big ego to respond by saying \u201cI am an expert.\u201d But the truth is, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you or I are experts or not. My goal is not to show my authority. My goal is to help each poet see their poem\u2019s potential, and feel confident they\u2019ve got the skill to take it there, and feel excited about that\u00a0journey. If I manage that, I\u2019ve succeeded in giving you a good critique. Many thanks to my recent critique partners, Dewi and Kathy Jacobs, for giving me an opportunity to think about these things.
