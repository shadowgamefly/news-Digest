{"content": "Quincy, Great article on taming the tongue. I\u2019m convalescing from a back injury and need to walk slowly around my yard. Last night, home alone, I thought I\u2019d get into the spirit of Lent ( 40 days before Easter. ) so I began listening on YouTube to \u201cLent \u2013 St Thomas Aquinas\u201d Now I only reached the 30 minute point in the 2.5 hr piece, however this first section has detail on the merits of fasting.
