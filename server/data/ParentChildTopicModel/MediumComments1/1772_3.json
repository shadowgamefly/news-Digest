Those\u00a0\u2026 universities are now the bastion of removing free speech, of adding racial and gender bias and promote the notion that some ideas are just too dangerous to be uttered aloud and their speaker to be chastised and driven out of campus. Effectively, it seems the value system that once sought to abolish bias and prejudice has morphed into one that seeks to \u2018identify\u2019 bias and prejudice, and then attack it. It is all quite tragic. In an eagerness to address bias and prejudice, minds have had to define these things, and have gotten that part horribly wrong.

As a result they have embodied the very biases and prejudices they sought to remove\u200a\u2014\u200aalbeit they are now upside down: the archetypical evil person is no longer the black lesbian but the cis white male.
