{"content": "This happens to me all the time when designing. I\u2019m still surprised at times when I at first show a design on my phone. Sketch Mirror helps, but when your mind knows what is there it has a way of filling the gaps even when you see your design on a small screen with a little less contrast. Hopefully a sketch plugin maker reads this and designs something that could scale through the different possible lighting/how contrast will appear situations. Until then you\u2019ve inspired me to turn down the contrast on my monitor. I think I\u2019m guilty of having it cranked up, maybe I\u2019m not the only designer guilty of this and it is what is causing the real problem.
