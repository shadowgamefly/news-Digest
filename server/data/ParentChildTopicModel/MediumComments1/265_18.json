{"content": "Well done. This is one of the main reasons my interest in sports in general is waning. I dropped cable because it was expensive. When a less expensive option became available I realized TV was really a time suck and didn\u2019t buy in. The only thing I really missed about cable was live sports, so I turned to sports writing\u200a\u2014\u200aprimarily on the internet. The problem is as noted here: I can\u2019t stand the politics in today\u2019s sports writing. I liked Grantland\u2019s balance of pop-culture mixed with sports, but I simply cannot stand 538, to the point I find that I actively avoid ESPN\u2019s website because of it. Even if I agreed with every political point made in a sports article, it still contains politics, which I don\u2019t want in my sports. Sports is an escape to me, and so if I\u2019m trying to escape politics for a bit, that\u2019s absolutely the LAST thing I want in my sports reporting. It\u2019s easier to just not pay attention. I can hit the gym or play actual sports and certainly have it be a better use of my time over all. ", "child": "", "name": "265_18", "parent": "265", "title": ""}
