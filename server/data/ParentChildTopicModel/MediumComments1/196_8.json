{"content": "I\u2019ve read a number of articles similar to this. I\u2019ve never actually implemented what was suggested. Probably out of fear of committing to it and then failing to be consistent. Your articles always uplift my spirit. Thank you for your hard work. I am going to take your advice, as scared as I am of failing at being consistent. Sleep is my biggest hurdle. I\u2019ve struggled with waking up my entire life. I have severe ADD as well as depression that gives me a sort of anxiety to go to sleep at night. It\u2019s odd. During the periods of my life where I was healthy and thriving the most, I was consistently doing most if not all of the things on your list. I\u2019m going to give it a shot, I know if I can do it, it will get me out of a dark hole Ive gotten myself into. As a stay at home mom, routine is hard for me. It\u2019s very important for my children, but it almost feels like I\u2019m allergic to it for lack of a better word. I crave it, but I run from it. Anyways, thanks again for your help and hard work. Wish me luck! ", "child": "", "name": "196_8", "parent": "196", "title": ""}
