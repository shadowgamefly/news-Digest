{"content": "Great catch! Love it when folks approach a challenge critically. I didn\u2019t consider that case initially, but I think it\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s step back a bit: remember we chose to interpret a(4) as a call to a() with argument 4. We could interpret s i n ( 4 5 ) in two ways: sin() of 45 [function call] or s*i*n*45 [implicit multiplication]. The latter is forbidden by our rules, though, so it all works out. Whether that\u2019s what the user intended or not I\u2019d a different matter, one which we can help in by educating the user properly. Admittedly, there are lots more possible malformed inputs that could cause headaches. But I stated in the article that we\u2019re \u201ctrusting\u201d the user to provide valid input,\u00a0so\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0focus\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0tokenizing. However, implementing validation is another interesting challenge that I plan to take on soon enough. Cheers! ", "child": "", "name": "868_7", "parent": "868", "title": ""}
