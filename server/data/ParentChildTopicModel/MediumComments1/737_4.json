{"content": "Do the sources, if any, substantiate the account? If there is a mismatch between the story and its sources, that is a clear signal of falsity. Last week, I wrote about an eye-opening experience with fake news. I\u2019m no Donald Trump fan, so I was prepared to believe the headline I saw on Facebook: Mike Pence Gets \u2018Booed Like Crazy\u2019 at \u2018Hamilton\u2019. But something quickly became apparent when I watched the actual video embedded in the story: it didn\u2019t match the description given in the article or the headline. As shown in the video, many people cheered Mike Pence as he entered the theater, and the most apparent \u201cBoo\u201d sounded like it was from the person holding the camera. By contrast, in the New York Times story about the same event, the description in the text closely matched the video. Many fake new stories contain jarring discrepancies between the headline and the story or between the story and its sources. Again, this is something that can be detected by a computer program (although comparing text to video may be at the outer edge of today\u2019s capabilities.) Note that the program does not have to find absolute truth; it just has to cast a reasonable doubt, just like a human jury.", "child": "", "name": "737_4", "parent": "737", "title": ""}
