{"content": "Russell is the MVP. He has the most convincing individual, team and entertainment/sentimental all-around season. Carried a broken and wrecked team, franchise and city. Played with the most heart and guts. The Analytics are there not just the triple double but BPM, VORP and PER. Brought the game to life all over the nation with passionate and loud chants of MVP in away games\u2026 There\u2019s a reason why he has the fans and former players vote but none of the media at all. I don\u2019t understand how you can advocate or support a player who rests in the first half of the season and takes countless nights off with a losing record in the last half of the year. That\u2019s just the media worship of Lebron for you. ", "child": "", "name": "25_13", "parent": "25", "title": ""}
