{"content": "Not wanting a child is a tough decision to make. It alienates you from a large number of people. In reality it takes a strong person, man or woman, to admit that they don\u2019t want something just because everyone else does. It also takes a strong person to make meaning in their own lives in ways others may not consider conventional. I\u2019m forever grateful that I was brought into this world, mostly because I\u2019m not sure what the other options were, but also because I like living life. I find meaning in life every day, have wonderful relationships and am with someone who has the same viewpoints as me. I also have only one cat. So I\u2019m child-free and you don\u2019t need to worry about me.", "child": "", "name": "487_1", "parent": "487", "title": ""}
