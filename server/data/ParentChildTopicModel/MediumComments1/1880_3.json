{"content": "A wonderful article but I really would challenge that term the father of mindfulness and having met the man a few times I think he would too, he even acknowledges this in the article by saying that mindfulness is at the heart of Buddhist thinking philosophy and psychology and is this a practice of over 2,500 yrs from the experiences of Siddartha himself. Thich Nhat Hanh came teaching mindfulness in the west before JKZ started and although I know they have a great deal of respect for each other, TNH was teachign for about twenty years before JKZ started spreading the word but it is the inherent racism of the western world tht it takes more notice of a white scientist than a Zen Master from Vietnam, who has worked tirelessly for world peace and is only slowed down now by health and old age. In terms of what mindfulness offers, it is indeed true that it offers an incredible life journey into happiness and deep deep joy of life itself in the moment by moment truths of it all. It literally saved my life, which is what I am slowly writing about in my post called Travelling The Alphabet, most of which is here on Medium. That mindfulness is \u201ccounter-productive\u201d for certain folks, especially those with mental and behavioral issues\u2019, it must be emphasized the \u2018some\u2019 being a very small number and that the vast number of those with mental health issues would actually be helped greatly by this practice. I have been to the other side of life, I have lived through the hell realms with PTSD, and it was developing and trusting mindfulness that eventually brought me to a place of deep deep peace and joy, as of course 20+ years ago I became mindfulness teacher, which is it own source of joy, mostly not for money or not much, and certianly not as a career move ", "child": "", "name": "1880_3", "parent": "1880", "title": ""}
