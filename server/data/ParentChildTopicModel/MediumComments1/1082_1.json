All they care about is lining their own pockets with Koch Industries payroll money and insurance industry donations. When will the underserved white people who vote for these goons wake up to the fact that they are in the same boat as other struggling populations\u2014the same boat that has been created by decades of bungling Republican greed glossed with a veneer of self-righteous religious nay-saying?
