{"content": "I grew up in church, but I didn\u2019t embrace the Gospel life until my college years. Even then, letting go of my two-bit \u201cChristian life\u201d and opening myself up instead to a relationship with God predicated on His grace was a painful process. It meant becoming increasingly aware of the depth of my wickedness, and coming to terms with the fact that, in God\u2019s economy, my talents and accomplishments and reputation and good behavior weren\u2019t worth a damn thing. Everything I thought made me important was a delusion. Everything I thought made me a good person was shown to be corrupted. Every vote of approval or disapproval from the crowd had to be discarded, and every last piece of my religious paradigm dismantled, until all that remained was one irreducibly complex truth: That God demonstrated His love toward me in that, while I was yet a sinner, Christ died for me.", "child": "", "name": "570_1", "parent": "570", "title": ""}
