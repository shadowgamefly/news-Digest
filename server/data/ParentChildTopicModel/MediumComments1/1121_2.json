{"content": "Traditional indexes are market cap weighted. The market as a whole is market cap weighted. The portion that is not indexed (i.e. active) must also be market cap weighted for the sum of the 2 parts to equal the market. In other words, active in aggregate and passive hold the same stuff and whatever is cheaper will outperfom. This is just math as alpha is a zero sum game.

What is unsettled is whether good active can be identified with any reliability. ", "child": "", "name": "1121_2", "parent": "1121", "title": ""}
