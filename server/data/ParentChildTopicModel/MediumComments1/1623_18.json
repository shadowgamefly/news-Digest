{"content": "I forget what I estimated. $130 I think it was? Friday I forgot it was me and my BF\u2019s \u201canniversary,\u201d so we got takeout\u200a\u2014\u200amy share was $10. Saturday we got up early and drove out to Brimfield. We stopped at Marshall\u2019s so my BF could buy shorts because it was almost 80 degrees and he forgot to bring a pair. I ended up getting a bridal shower gift for next weekend, $30. I spent $10 at the fair on an adorable vintage dress, and my BF bought me a cool bracelet there, but that was all we bought. I spent $3 on fresh donuts there also. We stopped at Tree House Brewing on the way home. Yesterday I filled my gas tank ($25) and went to book club ($7 on donuts). Later on I spent $8 at the grocery store on chicken and broccoli for the week\u2019s lunches. Total: $85 ", "child": "", "name": "1623_18", "parent": "1623", "title": ""}
