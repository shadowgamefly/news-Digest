{"content": "Great article! A couple thoughts: \u201cKeep your type black\u201d is good advice for people who aren\u2019t design nerds, but (1) not usng #000 isn\u2019t neccessarily a problem, and (2) sticking to #000 doesn\u2019t neccessarily solve the problem, as you note in your example of Apple\u2019s notorious flirtation with Helvetica Neue Ultralight. The solution I\u2019d like is an accessibility tool \u2013 ideally, one that worked both interactively and as part of a build process \u2013 that took not only color but size and weight into account to create a \u201cPerceived Contrast\u201d score.Speaking of tools, do you have any recommendations for accessibility tools every designer/developer/designoper should be using?
