{"content": "\u201cHas her vision risen to the level of personal attacks she has to receive in the press or the claims of falsifying information?\u201d \u201cWere she a shy, pimply, awkward male engineer with a pocket protector she would fit an archetype that would make sense to observers.\u201d The harsh criticism against Perry is not coming out of nothing: time and again she has not only explicitly mocked the clich\u00e9 of the engineer that you refer to yourself (cf the parallel between an engineering degree and having Aspergers in her TEDx talk) but used it to designate engineers as part of the problem with their supposed \u201clinear thinking\u201d and incapacity to \u201cthink out of the box\u201d: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukgnU2aXM2c Then she proceeded to hire a bunch of talented\u2026 engineers\u00a0! who are certainly hard-working and making progress on different aspects of the challenge boldly defined by Perry (with little initial understanding of the critical technical details), this being by no means a guarantee that the challenge is and was ever viable in the first place, for the reasons nicely laid out by Paul Reynolds in his blog. What engineers and technically literate people do abhor is the type of PR hyperbole, coupled with many little details showing that the speaker has a critical lack of understanding of the physics/technical details (cf the \u201cvoltmeter demo\u201d at D9 which demonstrated absolutely nothing for anyone with a basic understanding of electroncis but wowed the non-technical crowd), which Perry has indulged in over the years, making extensive use of the echo chamber provided by lazy, technically clueless \u201ctech\u201d journalists delighted by the fairy-tale dimension of the story: the genius dropout young female having a vision to change the world. And yes, the \u201c young and blonde\u201d female aspect was central, which is sexism in negative: would the company have made the news so much with a male CEO\u00a0? So allow me to say that, only judging from her various public statements and regardless of her personal qualities, yes, she does deserve some of the \u201charsh skepticism\u201d, to call it like that, that she\u2019s receiving these days.
