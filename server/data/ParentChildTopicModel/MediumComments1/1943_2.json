{"content": "Man, I saw some awful 1970\u2019s Italian \u2018giallo\u2019 movies in college. They were entertaining in a perverse way, not really scary, not really gory, easy to take when combined with tall plastic containers of beer. Several gorgeous women in those movies. I can\u2019t remember their names, but I think Asia Argento is a real stretch to call a close second, maybe 52nd\u00a0! Don\u2019t stop at a 2012 flick, embrace the span of cinematic time!
