{"content": "Owning key content with good characters if only part of the solution. Video games by their nature, tend to be simplistic and not have the depth of character to make good long form content. This is evident from most of the video game movies that have come to market. It would be interesting to see someone take the characters from a game franchise and add the depth of back story to make good long form content. That would have the appeal of the video game, but also create long form content with watching. That won\u2019t be easy, but I would argue, with the effort, creating a cross over franchise would benefit both markets. The most profitable and consistent feature film content is actually the low budget stuff. Lots of horror film like \u201cthe purge\u201d or \u201cBlair witch\u201d have a great return on investment. They watch the production budget like a hawk, but that allows them to keep the budget under $10M and get $50M+ at the box office. I think Netflix is doing an amazing job transitioning in to becoming a studio. There\u2019s limited room in the market for the giant blockbuster, and the winners change every few years. Instead Netflix is delivering consistent smaller budget productions and driving customer adoption. They pay a fixed fee in advance and don\u2019t care about any sort of box office. They just want to drive subscribers and keep enough varied content to keep them engaged. The work I\u2019m doing at Technicolor is all about providing automated tools to productions to allow them lower and more consistent costs. If we can automate the steps of post production, we can reach out to the larger audience of content creators. I want everyone to be able to tell their story in a high quality way whether they are creating for YouTube out Netflix or a block buster studio film.
