MedicationOne thing that angers many people who don\u2019t have ADD is that doctors prescribe medicine. I\u2019m sure this is abused by some but I\u2019m equally sure it\u2019s life-saving for many. If you\u2019ve never had to live with and ADD brain you simply don\u2019t have the right to judge others who do. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re speaking about. I was prescribed with a very low dose of Adderall\u200a\u2014\u200a5mg. Because my food, drink and lifestyle choices mostly keep my ADD in a box I tend not to take drugs very often. I probably take Adderall twice per month maximum. But there simply are days where I need it. When I have to sit through an 8-hour deposition or planning session for a deposition, I\u2019m going to need it. If I haven\u2019t slept well for days and need to perform well (or avoid arguing) in a meeting Adderall is a lifesaver. I don\u2019t recommend medicine lightly. I also don\u2019t discourage it. It\u2019s a very personal decision between a patient and his or her doctor. But I know with not reservation that it makes a huge difference in my life when I need it. And all of those know-it-alls who claim they know what they\u2019re talking about when they say that \u201cADD isn\u2019t real\u201d or \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t medicate this condition\u201d should keep their opinions to themselves. And that\u2019s just me being polite. 10. Self RespectThe biggest gain from finding out you have ADD is just being more at peace with yourself. Once you know that you\u2019re not a loser, that it isn\u2019t just that you\u2019re a bad person for not completing tasks, when you understand why you argue or read 70% of your book\u00a0\u2026 you can get more comfortable in your own skin. You can look at life altering changes to food, drink, sleep, exercise (which helps greatly!) and even medicine. Just know that ADD isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. It can be a great strength. Embrace it. And respect yourself despite your flaws and idiosyracies. Everybody has them. Ours are simply unique to how our unique brain chemistry. ", "child": "2415_1\t2415_2\t2415_3\t2415_4"}
