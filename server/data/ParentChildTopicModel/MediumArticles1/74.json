I get they had to stand by their man, but this was the equivalent of a kindergartener coming back with his mom to show her the boy who bullied him. This was a bizarre situation on all fronts, and we\u2019re all worse for having witnessed it (or worse, taken sides). The Rising Riverwalk: A Deep Dive Into The San Antonio SpursDespite what was meant to be a transitional year, the Spurs are once again sitting pretty at the top of the Western\u202616winsaring.com Spurs Finish 50+ Wins for 18th\u00a0Time I get it. This is not news. This is sun coming up in the morning. This is you walking outside in the rain and finding out that you are suddenly damp. This is eating when hungry. Death. Taxes. Spurs winning 50 games in a season. But do not let the frequency with which Pop pulls 50 wins out of his hat overshadow the absurdity of the stat. Name something you\u2019ve been this exceptional at for 18 years? You can\u2019t. Even breathing is like \u201csure, acceptable, passable even, not exceptional,\u201d and you do it every minute of your life. You\u2019re just okay at something you\u2019ve been doing since birth. Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs are consistently amazing at basketball. I stopped betting against them. Swap the Phoenix Suns for the Spurs\u2019 roster, and they can still get 50 wins with Pop at the helm. James Dolan\u2019s Comments Show Everything That\u2019s Wrong With the New York KnicksIn light of the Charles Oakley incident on Wednesday night, Knicks CEO James Dolan attempted to clear things up on The\u202616winsaring.com Everything New York\u00a0Knicks When I read that the Knicks traded for the Derrick Rose and signed Joakim Noah for a gargantuan amount of money, I checked the calendar to make sure it wasn\u2019t 2011 (spoiler: it wasn\u2019t). There are two kinds of ludicrous events. One is Russell Westbrook cascading into explosion of pure basketball and statistical overload. That is the good kind. Then, there is everything that goes into the New York Knicks\u2019 decision-making flow-chart. That is most certainly the bad kind of ludicrous. The worst kind. They gave out questionable contracts to Rose and Noah (spoiler: Derrick Rose gets injured). They kicked out Charles Oakley, basically a legend and also top-five person you most certainly never want to mess with. They stuck to the triangle offense, despite their best players and the league as a whole outgrowing the principle. The New York Knicks are just here to remind you that even when things are bad, they can still always get worse. Stay vigilant. ", "child": "74_1"}
