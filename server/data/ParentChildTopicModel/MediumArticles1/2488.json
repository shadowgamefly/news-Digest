Have you read? The quest for the next-generation battery The US Department of Energy has set a goal of building a battery that can store energy for less than $100 per kilowatt-hour, which would make stored wind and solar energy competitive with energy produced from traditional power plants. The Harvard researchers say their breakthrough puts them within sight of this goal. \u201cIf you can get anywhere near this cost target then you change the world,\u201d said Michael Aziz, lead researcher and professor of Materials and Energy Technologies at Harvard. \u201cIt becomes cost effective to put batteries in so many places. This research puts us one step closer to reaching that target.\u201d Originally published at www.weforum.org.
