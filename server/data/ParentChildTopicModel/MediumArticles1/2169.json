It\u2019s a different way of approaching the same goal, but focusing on the higher order \u201cJob\u201d allows for broader thinking and looking for different possible solutions instead of locking in on just the obvious downstream problem. What is Jobs To Be\u00a0Done? Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) is the world\u2019s simplest idea; there is almost nothing new about it. Essentially, JTBD is a way of looking at a downstream problem from the original human root need, and letting that need be the motivation behind the many ways you could solve the problem. Here\u2019s an example: If someone buys a hammer at the hardware store, they are not buying it to hammer nails into their wall, they are buying it to hang memories and make their home feel like a home. Looking at this from a JTBD perspective, us as the people who make the hammers can take a step back and look at if a hammer and nail is the way we want to service that goal; the goal isn\u2019t to own a hammer, it\u2019s to warm up the living room. There are a lot of other great resources that help break down JTBD and the framework around using this in your design problems, like this article about writing features using job stories, or this one about big JTBD misconceptions. Here\u2019s a story about JTBD from my own real-world work. A guerrilla dive into QuickBooks Self-Employed I recently took a guerrilla research dive into some of the services that the QuickBooks Self-Employed service offers through its web and mobile app. I wanted to approach this rapid empathy study with the JTBD mindset that people hire us to serve them in some way to accomplish a life need, and gain insight into what that Job was. I wanted to peer into what they were originally trying to do in their lives that led them to us. What we offered through this product/service was mileage tracking, categorizing expenses as business or personal, estimating taxes, sending invoices, and a basic overview of your self-employed financial picture. Essential and simple stuff. I pulled some data, reached out to some local users and met them face to face. It was empathy time. No surveys, no studies, no remote testing sessions. No testing at all! We were getting human. Well, after talking to these wonderful humans, suffice it to say, here\u2019s a simple list of things they weren\u2019t trying to do: WHAT? But wait! That\u2019s what our product does! If they aren\u2019t trying to do that, what exactly is it that we\u2019re offering them?? The truth is, that our customers wanted a \u201cJob\u201d to be done at a deeper level that created a disconnect between the \u201cofferings\u201d of our service, and the true needs the customers were trying to fulfill. The list is the \u201chow and what\u201d of how we\u2019re addressing needs. These true needs manifested as abstract goals that serve a greater purpose to their well-being or livelihood.
