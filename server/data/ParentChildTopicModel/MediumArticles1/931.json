One-to-ones with team-members As a new PM you might think that bilateral meetings are only for line managers. Although the \u201cofficial\u201d version of these meetings happens with their direct superiors, you can and should have regular bilaterals with everyone you work with. By having one-to-ones, you can give & receive feedback to catch possible issues early and get insights into each individual\u2019s life. The goal is to listen more and talk less. Use these meetings as a private retrospective where you decide together how to improve day to day work. An easy format that gets the talking going is the well-known \u201cKeep, Develop, Drop\u201d. So go on, open up your calendar and start scheduling. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a good format for these meetings and you\u2019ll see the benefits from day 1.
