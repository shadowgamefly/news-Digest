At least at my\u00a0house. I was on a phone call this morning when a perfect storm of certain elements of my life collided. The elements. A) My father-in-law, George, has dementia and lives in my basement apartment with my mother-in-law,who also has dementia. B) My 23-year-old son, Nick, has autism, and lives in the room that used to be my office. C) I work from home. D) I am technologically stupid and couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn the speaker phone off on my iPhone after I\u2019d navigated away from the keyboard screen. What happened. So, I\u2019m in my bedroom, which is the only room in my house (that isn\u2019t a bathroom) that has a door I can shut. I\u2019m on speaker phone so I can take notes during this semi-important phone call, when George shows up. He knocks, but didn\u2019t take the hint when I ignored him in favor of my call. It doesn\u2019t work. He comes on in. Record scratch. Let\u2019s stop here for just a second. I want to make sure you appreciate this point: My father-in-law burst into my bedroom. My life, you guys. Onward. Because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn off my speaker phone, especially in a moment of quasi panic, here\u2019s the earful my caller was subjected to: George: I don\u2019t want Nick in our apartment anymore. And we want a lock with a key. Me: Okay, George, I\u2019m on a call, I\u2019ll come down in a minute. George: (All caps do, in fact, indicate yelling.) HE ATE OUR CANDY. Caller: Shaunta? Me: Nick came into your apartment when you weren\u2019t home? George: Yes. AND HE ATE ALL OUR CANDY. Me: Wow. Okay. Let me finish this call and I\u2019ll talk to him. George: I don\u2019t want to be an SOB, but I don\u2019t want him knocking on our door when he forgets his key either. He can just wait outside. Me: Okay. George: I don\u2019t want to be a SOB. Me: Okay. Thanks. What really happened. Nick knocked on their door early in the morning because, as he often does, he forgot his key. Their door is a sliding glass door leading out of our open air basement. It was pitch dark, of course, because it was 4:30 in the freaking morning. George got out of bed and let Nick in. On his way through their living room to the stairs that would take him upstairs, Nick took candy out of their bowl. Because he has autism and struggles with both boundaries and social skills, it didn\u2019t occur to my son that showing up at 4:30 in the morning was a bad idea. He needed in and that was the path he barreled down. It also didn\u2019t occur to him that a bowl of candy didn\u2019t mean that they were there for visitors to take. Especially at 4:30 in the morning, when a cranky old man has just jerked out of sleep by you banging on his door. Mystery solved, by the way: George and his wife ate their own candy. My life with autism and dementia. If anyone in this house needs a lock on their door, it\u2019s me. I have eight younger brothers and sisters.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve had a whole lot of experience with peace and tranquility. In fact, I usually thrive on chaos. Most of the time I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re in a position to take care of both my husband\u2019s parents and our son. But holy hell, every now and there there\u2019s a moment when I fantasize about those five minutes in the early 1990s when I had my very own apartment.
