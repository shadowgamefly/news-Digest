Trait No. 3: Blood, Sweat, and\u00a0Tears Is he the hardest-working player on the team, or at least one of the hardest? You would be astounded by how many teams ignore this. Do you think JaMarcus Russell was the hardest worker at LSU? Or Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M? Jeff Van Gundy once said, \u201cYour best player has to set a tone of intolerance for anything that gets in the way of winning.\u201d Being lazy? That gets in the way of winning. Lifting weights and taking care of your body? That\u2019s hard work. Had Washington valued hard work, it never would have acquired McNabb\u200a\u2014\u200ahe coasted on natural talent, and when it waned, he didn\u2019t have a backup plan. Examine recent busts and show me a truly hard worker who failed. Ryan Leaf showed up 20 pounds overweight for his combine weigh-in; why wasn\u2019t that a bigger red flag? Your franchise QB, if you can find one, should always be a gym rat. First to work, last to leave. He should be constantly working on his craft and constantly trying to improve. He should embrace hard work. And if he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re screwed. Trait No. 4: High Football\u00a0IQ Does he study tape? Alone or with the coach? Which day does he get the game plan? How much time does he need to \u201cknow\u201d it? Is he football smart? Today\u2019s college offenses are simple\u200a\u2014\u200aevery play comes from the sideline. In pro football, you\u2019re on your own and the game moves much faster. That means the appetite for knowledge must be in a quarterback\u2019s mental makeup. You cannot teach obsession; it has to come naturally. Take Drew Brees, who studies tape of opponents constantly. He knows the personnel, the scheme, and any adjustments within the scheme. He\u2019s so obsessed with gaining knowledge that his suggestions and recommendations can annoy his coaches. But all that knowledge helps him play fast, right? Remember, the NFL game moves significantly faster than the college game. How quickly a quarterback processes those 40\u201350 decisions per game and makes those decisions is critical. It can\u2019t happen without understanding what you studied on tape, then importing it from the classroom to the field. Everyone watches game film; few retain what they learned. Otherwise, those \u201cstudy\u201d sessions are worthless. Trait No. 5: The Crib\u00a0Factor Was he born to be a quarterback? There are no quarterback manufacturing plants in the USA. Great ones are born to play quarterback, whether it\u2019s Brady, Manning, Brees\u00a0\u2026 all of them were gifted from the crib with the right temperament, competitiveness, drive, ambition, determination, and natural instincts. You can\u2019t learn those things. All the great ones succeeded in pee-wee football, high school football, and college. All of them. The same goes for Deshaun Watson, who started as a freshman for his high school team and as a freshman for a powerhouse team at Clemson. It\u2019s a clear indication that Watson has the instinctive had-it-since-he-was-in-the-crib gene. On the flip side, think about Ryan Tannehill. A terrific athlete? Absolutely. Naturally instinctive for the position? No. The faster the game becomes, the more instincts take over\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s when Tannehill gets into trouble. Look at his career numbers on third down: He\u2019s thrown 26 interceptions, averages a half yard less per attempt than his overall average, and completes just 58 percent of his passes. The faster the game, the less you like Tannehill. The opposite is true for Watson. That\u2019s the crib factor. The Pros and Cons of the Star Running Backs in This DraftInitial scouting impressions of Leonard Fournette, Dalvin Cook, Christian McCaffrey, and the extremely underrated Alvin\u2026theringer.com Trait No. 6: Body\u00a0Language You must attend a live game to get a feel for the body language of the player\u200a\u2014\u200aand when you do, do you like what you see? Is body language important? Ask Bears fans! Jay Cutler would still be starting if his sideline body language had been more caring and engaged. There were times last season when he looked as if he\u2019d rather be having a root canal. Cutler\u2019s struggles to protect the ball become compounded with terrible body language after the mistake. It doesn\u2019t seem like he cares. That creates problems inside and outside of the locker room. Geno Auriemma is one of our best coaches of the past 25 years; everything he\u2019s built and sustained at UConn, with that much player turnover, is just remarkable. Did you know he benches his best players (even his stars!) if he doesn\u2019t like their body language? Imagine what Geno would have done to Cam Newton when he was flossing his teeth on the sideline or hanging a towel over his head. Football teams feed off their QB, for better and worse. Trait No. 7: The Charm\u00a0Factor Do his teammates love him? What do his teammates say about him, off the record? The star quarterback has to be respected, feared, and loved. His competitive nature must be contagious. Teammates must want to play with him. And he must command the huddle. If you can\u2019t say those four things about your QB, you won\u2019t win. Any team missing a leader at quarterback ends up being rudderless. It\u2019s the law of football. Of course, finding the truth on this specific subject is the biggest challenge of all. Colleges are trained to say wonderful things about their prospects. Why? Because planting players on NFL teams helps promote their programs. Teams cannot rely on finding out the right information from any college staff. They have to dig deeper. Recently a top prospect\u200a\u2014\u200aI won\u2019t say who\u200a\u2014\u200awas dinged by his college teammates. They hated him to the degree that they refused to attend any of his private workouts. That\u2019s a huge red flag. An unfortunate NFL team ignored it and drafted him on Day 1. What happened? His new teammates ended up feeling just like his old ones. That\u2019s a surprise? You don\u2019t just suddenly flip from being a bad teammate to a good one. A winning pedigree. Thick skin. Work ethic. High football IQ. Instincts. Positive body language. Good teammate. It\u2019s not like these indicators are mind-shattering or revolutionary. But whenever teams begin with the end in mind\u200a\u2014\u200ascouting outside in\u200a\u2014\u200athey ignore some of those indicators and get themselves into trouble. Teams lie to themselves. They believe they can change habits, that they can neutralize red flags. They can\u2019t. Miracles don\u2019t happen when you draft a QB. You might stumble into a gem because other teams misevaluated him (Derek Carr), or because his college sample size wasn\u2019t quite big enough (Tom Brady), or because everyone else wrote him off for the wrong reason (Drew Brees and his height). Any time an NFL team gets lucky, it\u2019s due to circumstance, not because it took a chance and magically transformed a flawed product. You can\u2019t luck into a Hassan Whiteside in football; not at quarterback. Just ask any Washington fan. They watched their favorite team ignore that Heath Shuler struggled to grasp an offense in college. They ignored that Patrick Ramsey wasn\u2019t an instinctive player, that Jason Campbell lacked the ability to process decisions quickly, that Robert Griffin III didn\u2019t check enough of the aforementioned seven boxes. They spent 25 years getting it wrong, other than with Kirk Cousins\u00a0\u2026 and we don\u2019t even know if they got that right. Maybe there\u2019s hope. This spring, Watson started climbing the big boards and even vaulted over Trubisky. The Ringer\u2019s Danny Kelly believes Watson could go as high as fourth to Jacksonville. Incredible! Are NFL teams starting to figure out how to scout that position? We won\u2019t know for sure until Washington spends another first-round pick on its next QB of the future. I bet we don\u2019t have to wait too long.
