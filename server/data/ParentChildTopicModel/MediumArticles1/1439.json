Here it is\u2026 I\u2019ll start with the thesis, then dive into a laundry list of supporting points and reasons why I\u2019m not leaving Snapchat and my friends aren\u2019t either. Thesis Now, let\u2019s dive into the nitty-gritty\u2026 Snapchat as it\u2019s own category/niche Snapchat is in a category all its own, with goals which differ widely from Facebook. If Evan Spiegel didn\u2019t have plans different from Mark Zuckerberg, he would\u2019ve taken the $3 billion that was offered to him by Facebook. Facebook is not, and never will be, Snapchat because at its very core the former is focused on connectivity and inclusivity while the latter is focused on privacy, intimacy, and exclusivity.

Begin thinking of Snapchat as an intimate chatroom with your most loyal followers and less like the center-stage at the Super\u00a0Bowl. The privacy Many of the aspects Owen brings up in his article are exactly the features that make Snapchat unique and valuable to users everywhere (no discovery feature, the difficulty of adding a user on Snapchat, etc.). Intimacy, privacy, and borderline-secrecy are exactly what has made the Spiegel squad explode over the years.

Snapchat is the gem of one of the fastest growing tech scenes on the planet: the Silicon Beach. Social media is becoming media and entertainment. And we all know Los Angeles has a better foothold in that marketplace than the Silicon\u00a0Valley. Being the centerpiece of this movement could be one of the most useful weapons Snapchat has in its arsenal. There\u2019s just something about Evan\u00a0Spiegel\u2026 In much the same way many who invest in Tesla are investing in Elon Musk, there will be many who invest in Snap because of Evan Spiegel. From a qualitative perspective, there\u2019s just something about him. In addition to the characteristics I\u2019ve listed throughout this article, there are many reasons I\u2019ll be investing in Snap: the strangle-hold the company could have on augmented reality within social media, and the blurring of lines between entertainment and social media, and more. However, the biggest reason of all is because I believe in Evan Spiegel. Plain and simple. Snapchat understands cool. It just has something other companies do not. In the same way Apple did over Microsoft\u200a\u2014\u200athat Jobs had over Gates. To highlight the advantage Spiegel has over his Silicon Valley combatants, I always point to the design of Snapchat Spectacles versus that of Google Glass. We will see if the company continues down this path in the coming years. The caveat Snapchat will only retain this niche & value proposition if Evan Spiegel acts more like Jeff Bezos and less like Jack\u00a0Dorsey. What do I mean by this? Well, Snap\u2019s IPO is coming soon. If Evan Spiegel lets the horror that is Wall Street erode Snapchat\u2019s identity by competing directly with Facebook and focusing on quarterly growth, then Owen will be 100% right: we have another Twitter on our hands.
