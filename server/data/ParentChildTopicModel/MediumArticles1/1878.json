Kipling\u2019s view of war is repeatedly put into question, beginning with the first story, \u201cIn the Matter of a Private.\u201d The eponymous character is Private Simmons, whose platoon is stationed somewhere in India.

Two proper English women respond to the death of a loved one by sizing up his achievements and moving on as quickly as possible\u200a\u2014\u200aMiss Fowler doesn\u2019t even attend his funeral. Mary appears totally unfazed by the \u201cripped and shredded body\u201d of the little girl. Arguably the most human character in the story is the German soldier, who \u201cshed a tear\u201d and \u201cwhimpered,\u201d and whose eyes \u201cwere alive with expectation\u201d upon seeing Mary and whose mouth \u201ctried to smile\u201d at her. Kipling ostensibly dehumanizes the German by calling him \u201cIt\u201d and stripping him of pronouns\u200a\u2014\u200ahis head is \u201cthe head,\u201d his mouth is \u201cthe mouth\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut actually does the opposite by making him the only character capable of feeling. Everyone else is icily pragmatic."}, {"4193": "\u201cMary Postgate,\u201d then, is yet another of Kipling\u2019s stories in which the utility of war and the morality of the people involved is put into question. \u201cWhat waste it all is!\u201d exclaims Mary as she sorts through Wynn\u2019s possessions, and with this story in mind it seems like Kipling might have agreed."}, {"e3e2": "If these three stories reveal a cynical view of war, then they do so by trivializing its actors. A private who snaps after being called names; a selfish colonel; a sniper testing his aim; a pilot who dies on a training flight; an anonymous German soldier. Over and over, Kipling gives the sense that a soldier\u2019s life means nothing."}, {"2800": "\u201cThe Gardener\u201d is different. Unlike the stories discussed above, it was written after the death of Kipling\u2019s son, and in fact Kipling began writing it on the same day he visited a war cemetery containing eleven thousand graves. Considered by some to be Kipling\u2019s most evocative work, \u201cThe Gardener\u201d tells the story of a woman named Helen Turrell, who took it upon herself to raise \u201cher only brother\u2019s unfortunate child,\u201d Michael. It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cThe Gardener\u201d contains a famous twist, one that I\u2019d rather not spoil for those who haven\u2019t read it. The text is available here, and of all the stories in this collection I think this one most deserves a read. If you\u2019d like a second opinion, American critic Edmund Wilson had this to say: \u201cI am not sure that it is not really the best story that Kipling ever wrote.\u201d"}, {"3987": "Anyway, once Michael comes of age he joins the army and eventually goes missing. The reader learns that he was killed by a \u201cshell splinter\u201d but the telegram Helen receives merely states that he is missing. \u201cMissing always means dead,\u201d Helen tells herself repeatedly as she lowers the blinds in her home, and thus the grieving process begins."}, {"70d3": "\u201cThe Gardener\u201d is the only story in this collection in which the death of a soldier merits grieving, so it\u2019s our first look at the process through Kipling\u2019s eyes. Here\u2019s how the narrator describes it:"}, {"f491": "Once, on one of Michael\u2019s leaves, he had taken her over a munition factory, where she saw the progress of a shell from blank iron to the all-but-finished article. It struck her at the time that the wretched thing was never left alone for a single second; and \u201cI\u2019m being manufactured into a bereaved next of kin,\u201d she told herself, as she prepared her documents."}, {"0b4e": "Later, when Michael\u2019s body is found and reinterred in a military cemetery, Helen \u201c[finds] herself moved on to another process of the manufacture\u200a\u2014\u200ato a world full of exultant or broken relatives, now strong in the certainty that there was an altar upon earth where they might lay their love.\u201d The reader follows Helen as she proceeds along the assembly line, journeying via train and boat, spending the night in one of the few hotels conveniently located near the cemetery, now filled to capacity with mourners. When she arrives at the cemetery, she finds it \u201cstill in the making\u201d but already at twenty-thousand graves. Helen becomes disoriented in the \u201cmerciless sea of black crosses\u201d but eventually finds a gardener who is able to help her locate Michael\u2019s grave."}, {"c5d7": "Helen\u2019s trip through the assembly line ends there, and so does the story. Manufacturing is a central theme, highlighting a universal lack of agency and individuality. Helen, of course, gets made into a generic \u201cbereaved next of kin,\u201d but she\u2019s not alone. Michael \u201cwas to have gone up to Oxford\u201d but \u201cthe war took him\u201d and his Captain \u201cheaded him off and steered him directly to a commission in a Battalion.\u201d His classmates, meanwhile, are grimly reduced to \u201cthe first holocaust of public-school boys who threw themselves into the Line.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this kind of mechanical dehumanization before\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in \u201cMary Postgate\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut this time we have a believable and emotional character as our protagonist, so we can see things through her point of view. To that end, the language isn\u2019t cynical and distant but vulnerable and intimate:"}, {"e51f": "Michael had died and her world had stood still and she had been one with the full shock of that arrest. Now she was standing still and the world was going forward, but it did not concern her\u200a\u2014\u200ain no way or relation did it touch her."}, {"de8b": "This woman, whose world ends the day she loses Michael and who feels \u201cagony,\u201d is someone with whom the reader can identify, so \u201cThe Gardener\u201d lands with far more force than Kipling\u2019s other war stories. The reader is invited to consider how it feels to be in Helen\u2019s situation, getting pushed through the stages of the bereavement \u201critual\u201d that has become customary in her village."}, {"5459": "Somehow the only person in Helen\u2019s life capable of genuine sympathy is the gardener, who \u201clook[s] at her with infinite compassion.\u201d One cannot help but wonder whether this gentle gardener, \u201cbending over his young plants,\u201d is a stand-in for Kipling himself, who certainly could have identified with Helen\u2019s situation, and who in fact joined the Imperial War Graves Commission after his son\u2019s death."}, {"20bc": "These stories, which portray war as senseless, mundane, and heartbreaking, left me with a much different impression of Kipling than I had anticipated: one that\u2019s more contemplative and human. I opened this book expecting to adamantly oppose the mindset central to Kipling\u2019s war stories, but I ended up relating to his cynicism and empathizing with his characterization of loss. Stories is a disorienting read."}, {"e2c5": "Adding to confusion is the fact that today Kipling is best known not for his opinions on war but for his children\u2019s stories, most notably The Jungle Book. There are a few likewise playful stories in this collection, including a fable called \u201cThe Cat that Walked by Himself,\u201d and the silly but heartwarming story of a polo tournament told from the horses\u2019 perspective. Occasionally Kipling puts his Romantic side on display, as in this excerpt from \u201cThey,\u201d which explores the fleeting nature of youth and reads like Shelley:"}, {"667d": "Yet the late flowers\u200a\u2014\u200amallow of the wayside, scabious of the field, and dahlia of the garden\u200a\u2014\u200ashowed gay in the mist, and beyond the sea\u2019s breath there was little sign of decay in the leaf. Yet in the villages the house doors were all open, and barelegged, bareheaded children sat at ease on the damp doorsteps to shout \u201cpip-pip\u201d at the stranger."}, {"eb78": "Stories offers a broad but fleeting glimpse into Kipling\u2019s morals, on which there is much dispute, and his talents, on which there is none. I admit, it\u2019s a little bizarre to be introduced to such an important author so randomly. My first impression of Kipling comes through a posthumously published assortment of short stories, while I expect that most readers will have discovered him through The Jungle Book or perhaps a survey course on imperialism. No matter. I feel lucky to have stumbled upon his work in any form, and I found Stories rewarding and interesting. And to think\u200a\u2014\u200aI bought this book purely on the hunch that something with a cover this beautiful simply must be worth reading. As for my caf\u00e9 hypothesis\u2026 well, that remains unproven. If you\u2019d like to do some field testing, feel free to borrow my copy."}], "content": "Book Review: Stories by Rudyard\u00a0Kipling Back in college I had this dream of meeting a girl in a caf\u00e9. Here\u2019s how I imagined it would happen: I\u2019d be sitting there reading some book, and the book would pique her interest enough to make her come say hello. Certainly, I\u2019m not the only literature major to have entertained this fantasy. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wondering what book, if any, could have this power. And I think I may have finally found it: Stories by Rudyard Kipling. Behold: Gold foil inlays in a red cover. A wide pink ribbon to keep your place. Illustrations accented with red. Pages edged in gold. Never mind the old adage about books and covers. When I discovered this beauty in my favorite used book store, I simply had to buy it. Sometime after the thrill of my purchase had worn off I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Rudyard Kipling, so I immersed myself in extensive scholarly research. My findings were rather disappointing. Here\u2019s what I learned. Kipling (1865\u20131936), beloved author of The Jungle Book, was the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

He wasn\u2019t paying lip-service, either. Kipling did in fact \u201csend forth the best [he bred]\u201d and helped his son, John, enlist in the British Army despite repeatedly failing the eye exam. (John would later be killed in action at age 18.) I therefore began reading Stories with a rather nasty notion of Kipling: racist, imperialistic, and maybe even a bit heartless. But the more I read, the more trouble I had reconciling these short stories with my vision of their author. Kipling\u2019s view of war is repeatedly put into question, beginning with the first story, \u201cIn the Matter of a Private.\u201d The eponymous character is Private Simmons, whose platoon is stationed somewhere in India. He and his comrades\u2019 mostly do nothing; their primary mission appears to be surviving the dual threat of boredom and heat exhaustion.

But it is a fact that, under certain circumstances, Thomas in bulk can be worked up into dithering, ripping hysteria. This is not the gleaming portrait of a British soldier I\u2019d expected from Kipling. It\u2019s also not the only negative depiction of a soldier in this story. Simmons\u2019 erratic shooting ends up wounding the Major of Gunners\u2019 shoulder, at which point the Corporal springs into action and disarms Simmons with a swift takedown. This might seem like heroism, but the Corporal later confesses that he only intervened to gain the favor of the Major so that the Major would secure for him some horses for his wedding: \u201cIf I \u2018adn\u2019t \u2018a\u2019 wanted somethng, Sim might ha\u2019 blowed [Major] Jerry Blazes\u2019 boomin\u2019 \u2018ead into Hirish stew for aught I\u2019d cared.\u201d After the dust settles, the Corporal gets his horses and Simmons gets hanged. Some stories are accompanied by an illustration, like this one for \u201cIn the Matter of a Private.\u201d All illustrations were done by American artist Howard\u00a0Rogers. What can we make of the soldiers in this story? Hardly men of action, they pass the time until they die from drinking too much, cholera, mindless infighting, or their own gallows\u200a\u2014\u200aand the narrator gives the impression that it doesn\u2019t matter which.

Mary responds, \u201cStop that, you bloody pagan!\u201d She\u200a\u2014\u200aor more precisely, the omniscient narrator\u200a\u2014\u200afurther dehumanizes the German by calling him \u201cthe thing beneath the oak tree\u201d and stating that Mary would only be satisfied once \u201cIt was dead.\u201d Mary initially appears angry and hateful, but soon she grows annoyed at the inconvenience of having to wait for the soldier to die: She looked at her wristwatch It was getting on to half-past four, and the rain was coming down in earnest. Tea would be at five. If It did not die before that time, she would be soaked and would have to change. Luckily for Mary, the German dies quickly so she has ample time to enjoy \u201ca luxurious bath before tea.\u201d Miss Fowler finds her \u201clying all relaxed on the sofa, \u2018quite handsome!\u2019\u201d How nice for Mary that a trio of deaths has not spoiled her evening! Here\u2019s the point: Kipling is known for portraying the English\u200a\u2014\u200aand particularly English women\u200a\u2014\u200aas stoic and strong during wartime, but he carries this depiction so far that his characters hardly seem human. Two proper English women respond to the death of a loved one by sizing up his achievements and moving on as quickly as possible\u200a\u2014\u200aMiss Fowler doesn\u2019t even attend his funeral. Mary appears totally unfazed by the \u201cripped and shredded body\u201d of the little girl. Arguably the most human character in the story is the German soldier, who \u201cshed a tear\u201d and \u201cwhimpered,\u201d and whose eyes \u201cwere alive with expectation\u201d upon seeing Mary and whose mouth \u201ctried to smile\u201d at her. Kipling ostensibly dehumanizes the German by calling him \u201cIt\u201d and stripping him of pronouns\u200a\u2014\u200ahis head is \u201cthe head,\u201d his mouth is \u201cthe mouth\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut actually does the opposite by making him the only character capable of feeling. Everyone else is icily pragmatic. \u201cMary Postgate,\u201d then, is yet another of Kipling\u2019s stories in which the utility of war and the morality of the people involved is put into question. \u201cWhat waste it all is!\u201d exclaims Mary as she sorts through Wynn\u2019s possessions, and with this story in mind it seems like Kipling might have agreed. If these three stories reveal a cynical view of war, then they do so by trivializing its actors. A private who snaps after being called names; a selfish colonel; a sniper testing his aim; a pilot who dies on a training flight; an anonymous German soldier. Over and over, Kipling gives the sense that a soldier\u2019s life means nothing. \u201cThe Gardener\u201d is different. Unlike the stories discussed above, it was written after the death of Kipling\u2019s son, and in fact Kipling began writing it on the same day he visited a war cemetery containing eleven thousand graves. Considered by some to be Kipling\u2019s most evocative work, \u201cThe Gardener\u201d tells the story of a woman named Helen Turrell, who took it upon herself to raise \u201cher only brother\u2019s unfortunate child,\u201d Michael. It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cThe Gardener\u201d contains a famous twist, one that I\u2019d rather not spoil for those who haven\u2019t read it. The text is available here, and of all the stories in this collection I think this one most deserves a read. If you\u2019d like a second opinion, American critic Edmund Wilson had this to say: \u201cI am not sure that it is not really the best story that Kipling ever wrote.\u201d Anyway, once Michael comes of age he joins the army and eventually goes missing. The reader learns that he was killed by a \u201cshell splinter\u201d but the telegram Helen receives merely states that he is missing. \u201cMissing always means dead,\u201d Helen tells herself repeatedly as she lowers the blinds in her home, and thus the grieving process begins. \u201cThe Gardener\u201d is the only story in this collection in which the death of a soldier merits grieving, so it\u2019s our first look at the process through Kipling\u2019s eyes. Here\u2019s how the narrator describes it: Once, on one of Michael\u2019s leaves, he had taken her over a munition factory, where she saw the progress of a shell from blank iron to the all-but-finished article. It struck her at the time that the wretched thing was never left alone for a single second; and \u201cI\u2019m being manufactured into a bereaved next of kin,\u201d she told herself, as she prepared her documents. Later, when Michael\u2019s body is found and reinterred in a military cemetery, Helen \u201c[finds] herself moved on to another process of the manufacture\u200a\u2014\u200ato a world full of exultant or broken relatives, now strong in the certainty that there was an altar upon earth where they might lay their love.\u201d The reader follows Helen as she proceeds along the assembly line, journeying via train and boat, spending the night in one of the few hotels conveniently located near the cemetery, now filled to capacity with mourners. When she arrives at the cemetery, she finds it \u201cstill in the making\u201d but already at twenty-thousand graves. Helen becomes disoriented in the \u201cmerciless sea of black crosses\u201d but eventually finds a gardener who is able to help her locate Michael\u2019s grave. Helen\u2019s trip through the assembly line ends there, and so does the story. Manufacturing is a central theme, highlighting a universal lack of agency and individuality. Helen, of course, gets made into a generic \u201cbereaved next of kin,\u201d but she\u2019s not alone. Michael \u201cwas to have gone up to Oxford\u201d but \u201cthe war took him\u201d and his Captain \u201cheaded him off and steered him directly to a commission in a Battalion.\u201d His classmates, meanwhile, are grimly reduced to \u201cthe first holocaust of public-school boys who threw themselves into the Line.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this kind of mechanical dehumanization before\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in \u201cMary Postgate\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut this time we have a believable and emotional character as our protagonist, so we can see things through her point of view. To that end, the language isn\u2019t cynical and distant but vulnerable and intimate: Michael had died and her world had stood still and she had been one with the full shock of that arrest. Now she was standing still and the world was going forward, but it did not concern her\u200a\u2014\u200ain no way or relation did it touch her. This woman, whose world ends the day she loses Michael and who feels \u201cagony,\u201d is someone with whom the reader can identify, so \u201cThe Gardener\u201d lands with far more force than Kipling\u2019s other war stories. The reader is invited to consider how it feels to be in Helen\u2019s situation, getting pushed through the stages of the bereavement \u201critual\u201d that has become customary in her village. Somehow the only person in Helen\u2019s life capable of genuine sympathy is the gardener, who \u201clook[s] at her with infinite compassion.\u201d One cannot help but wonder whether this gentle gardener, \u201cbending over his young plants,\u201d is a stand-in for Kipling himself, who certainly could have identified with Helen\u2019s situation, and who in fact joined the Imperial War Graves Commission after his son\u2019s death. These stories, which portray war as senseless, mundane, and heartbreaking, left me with a much different impression of Kipling than I had anticipated: one that\u2019s more contemplative and human. I opened this book expecting to adamantly oppose the mindset central to Kipling\u2019s war stories, but I ended up relating to his cynicism and empathizing with his characterization of loss. Stories is a disorienting read. Adding to confusion is the fact that today Kipling is best known not for his opinions on war but for his children\u2019s stories, most notably The Jungle Book. There are a few likewise playful stories in this collection, including a fable called \u201cThe Cat that Walked by Himself,\u201d and the silly but heartwarming story of a polo tournament told from the horses\u2019 perspective. Occasionally Kipling puts his Romantic side on display, as in this excerpt from \u201cThey,\u201d which explores the fleeting nature of youth and reads like Shelley: Yet the late flowers\u200a\u2014\u200amallow of the wayside, scabious of the field, and dahlia of the garden\u200a\u2014\u200ashowed gay in the mist, and beyond the sea\u2019s breath there was little sign of decay in the leaf. Yet in the villages the house doors were all open, and barelegged, bareheaded children sat at ease on the damp doorsteps to shout \u201cpip-pip\u201d at the stranger. Stories offers a broad but fleeting glimpse into Kipling\u2019s morals, on which there is much dispute, and his talents, on which there is none. I admit, it\u2019s a little bizarre to be introduced to such an important author so randomly. My first impression of Kipling comes through a posthumously published assortment of short stories, while I expect that most readers will have discovered him through The Jungle Book or perhaps a survey course on imperialism. No matter. I feel lucky to have stumbled upon his work in any form, and I found Stories rewarding and interesting. And to think\u200a\u2014\u200aI bought this book purely on the hunch that something with a cover this beautiful simply must be worth reading. As for my caf\u00e9 hypothesis\u2026 well, that remains unproven. If you\u2019d like to do some field testing, feel free to borrow my copy. ", "child": "1878_1\t1878_2"}
