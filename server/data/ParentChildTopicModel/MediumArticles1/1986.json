(Full disclosure: Miller was an assistant at Ohio State when I played for the Buckeyes, which would be a simple way of explaining why I like him so much. But he also made me play one-on-one full court for 30 straight minutes during a voluntary summer workout when I was hungover, so my memories of him aren\u2019t as fond as you might think.) March Can Be a Monotonous Slog for Only So LongThe upsets have to be right around the corner, right?theringer.com 10. We\u2019ll have to wait for the MADNESS to truly start, and that\u2019s\u00a0OK. For the first time since the 2007 tournament, all teams seeded no. 1 through no. 4 survived the first round, leaving casual fans unhappy with the lack of upsets and buzzer-beaters. I\u2019m a diehard fan of the sport and even I\u2019m not going to pretend like these first two days were particularly exciting. There were good games, and three no. 11 seeds advancing is noteworthy, but the truth is that one of the tournament\u2019s most exciting moments came when Jim Nantz, Grant Hill, and Bill Raftery\u2019s microphones went out, forcing a deer-in-the-headlights Tracy Wolfson to momentarily do the play-by-play. But here\u2019s another way to look at it: The lack of upsets means we\u2019re setting up for one hell of a second round and beyond. And isn\u2019t that what we all really want anyway? Upsets are great and all, but you\u2019re lying to yourself if you say you want to see an Elite Eight with the likes of Florida Gulf Coast, Winthrop, or Iona (unless you\u2019re a fan of one of those teams, of course). Most of us want to have our cake and eat it, too, but it\u2019s impossible to get both the shocking moments of madness and also the matchups we\u2019ve been looking forward to like Villanova-Duke in Madison Square Garden or Gonzaga-Arizona with a trip to the Final Four on the line. So yes, it sucks that Princeton\u2019s shot didn\u2019t go down against Notre Dame or that Jawun Evans\u2019s buzzer-beater against Michigan affected only the spread and not the outcome of the game. But just because the first two days were underwhelming, it doesn\u2019t mean that the March Madness gods no longer love us. We just have to be patient and keep the faith.
