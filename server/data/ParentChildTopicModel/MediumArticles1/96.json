Will his team\u2019s average record cost him too? Maybe the MVP is actually none of the above. Perhaps voter fatigue is not the problem for LeBron James but rather for the leader of the new superteam everyone turned against. That would be the defending two-time MVP, the one who went 204\u201334 the last three seasons and just put up another 25/4.5/6.5 on 63% true shooting, the best player on by far the best team. Is Steph Curry the MVP yet again, voter fatigue and all? He\u2019s not going to win it, but maybe he should. Maybe the Warriors are about to rampage through the playoffs and win another title, and maybe Curry continues to rack up records and wins and MVPs. Maybe we\u2019ll look back at this season a decade from now and wonder how we ever thought it was the Westbrook or Harden season when it was the Warriors season all along, and Chef Curry was cooking up another MVP season without us even noticing.
