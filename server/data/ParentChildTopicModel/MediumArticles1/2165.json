What if I tell you that a UI screen of an app should be designed in these exact five states? 1. Blank/Empty State Empty coffee cup and \u2018Watching\u2019 empty screen of eBay\u00a0app. Think about the initial state of a UI\u200a\u2014\u200aduring the first run of the app when there is no data to be shown\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0user. This is the \u2018empty cup' state. Design the screen in such a way that a call to action can be shown. Did you notice the \u201cGo shopping\u201d button in the \u2018Watching\u2019 screenshot of eBay app? Visit Empty States website for design inspiration. 2. Loading\u00a0State Coffee being poured into the cup and skeleton screen of \u2018My Orders\u2019 in Flipkart\u00a0app. When data is being loaded on to the UI screen, the user should be informed about this activity. \u2018Activity indicators' and \u2018skeleton screens\u2019 have to be designed for this. The above screenshot is the skeleton screen of \u2018My Orders' in Flipkart app. 3. Partial\u00a0State Half full (half empty) cup and prompt screen of LinkedIn\u00a0app. If the data on the screen is lesser than the ideal state, the users can be prompted to use the app more often or enter more data. LinkedIn app prompts the user to complete his profile by showing a screen filled with pointers and helpful info. 4. Error\u00a0State An upside down cup that cannot be filled and \u2018Location Not Found\u2019 error screen from Uber\u00a0app. Think about the errors that can occur on a screen and embed useful info for the users to get out of this annoying state. Try to design screens that take care of data missing errors, data validation errors in forms and internet connectivity errors. Your users will thank you for helping them out with relevant and contextual messages/action buttons. \u2018Location Not Found' error screen from Uber app is shown above. Observe how the message presents two options to the user to get out of the\u00a0whole\u00a0mess. 5. Ideal\u00a0State A cup full of hot, steaming coffee and home screen of Gaana music streaming app. We all know this, right? This is the first state that is designed in any app UI project. A screen full of data is presented in a useful, beautiful way. The screenshot shown above is the home screen of Gaana music streaming app. Takeaway Never forget your coffee cup while designing UI screens of\u00a0apps! Whenever a UI is being designed, just think about a coffee cup! Design beyond the ideal state of a UI screen to include four more states. Our mission is to help the users to lead a better life!
