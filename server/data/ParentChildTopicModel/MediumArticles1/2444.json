You check your e-mail, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat one last time before bedtime. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have enough energy to check LinkedIn today\u200a\u2014\u200aand besides, their mobile UI is not very good. Maybe you can start a company that will disrupt LinkedIn? They did just sell for a bunch of money, after all. Your last thought before bed: should you switch to the Android ecosystem? You are on the \u201cS\u201d iPhone replacement cycle, and you are getting impatient. But then you realize you are so heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem that it may not make sense. Vipassana Retreat. Photo by\u00a0kinnla. You briefly use mobile Safari to browse for Vipassana retreats. You hear a 10-day retreat in Soquel may be the ticket to shake things up. You realize it\u2019s not going to be possible. You download a meditation app. You turn it off. You don\u2019t have time. You briefly recall your ride home on the 280 tonight. The sun was setting. It was beautiful. You realize you live in paradise.
