Animation solves a lot of functional problems within interfaces and makes interfaces feel alive and truly responsive to the user. Let\u2019s explore the key animation tactics that improve the functionality and emotional power of your mobile interface. 1. System\u00a0Status There are always a number of processes happening backstage in your app, such as data are being downloaded from the server, calculations are taking place. Such process always take some time. You should let a user know that the app isn\u2019t frozen and to indicate the status of ongoing processed. Visual signs of progress give users a sense of control over the app. Loading Indicators Loading time is an unavoidable situation for most digital products. While animations won\u2019t solve the problem, they certainly make waiting less of a problem. When we can\u2019t shorten the line, we can certainly make the wait more pleasant. Creative progress indicators can reduce a user\u2019s perception of time. The animation influences your users\u2019 perception of your product, making it seem better than it actually is. If an app gives users something interesting to look at while waiting, this makes users pay less attention to the wait itself. Credits:\u00a0Ramotion Pull to\u00a0refresh A well-known animation in this group is \u201cpull down to refresh,\u201d which initiates a process of content updates on mobile devices. Credits: Zee\u00a0Young Tip: Pull-to-refresh animation should match the design outline of the app\u200a\u2014\u200aif the app is minimal, the animation should be as well. Notifications Because movement naturally draws attention, animating your notifications is a pleasant way to notify users about something without intruding too much upon the experience. Moving objects immediately grab user\u2019s attention. Credits: Arjun\u00a0Kani 2. Navigation and Transitions The most basic use of animation is in transitions. The logic behind this type of animation is to help the user comprehend the change that has just happened in the page\u2019s layout, what has triggered the change and how to initiate the change again later on. A classic example is a hamburger button that toggles hidden content. Motion design can effectively guide the user\u2019s attention in ways that both inform and delight. Credits: Gal\u00a0Shir While hamburger animation might be the most expected option here, there are plenty of other ways that animation complements navigation. Transport between navigational context Designers use animation to smoothly transport users between navigational contexts and explain changes in the arrangement of elements on a screen. Transitions should act as intermediaries between the different states of the UI, helping users to understand what is going on when the screen changes. Image credit: Ehsan\u00a0Rahimi Visual hierarchy and connection between\u00a0elements Animation is perfect for describing objects of the interface and illustrating how they interact with each other. Animation illustrates how elements are connected. Credits: Vitaly\u00a0Rubtsov Function change In certain cases, designers are forced to design an action button whose functionality changes under certain conditions. We often see this in mobile designs where overall space is limited. \u201cPlay\u201d and \u201dStop\u201d buttons are probably the most common example of multi-state buttons.

In example below, when user press floating action button, the plus sign transforms into a pencil. This indicates that the pencil is the primary creation method.

Button changes its look from a \u201cplus\u201d to the \u201cpencil\u201d to indicate that the function of the button has changed. Credits: Material\u00a0Design 3. Visual\u00a0Feedback Visual feedback is crucial for any user interface. It makes users feel in control and for the user, control means knowing and understanding their current context in the system at any given time. Acknowledgement User interface elements like buttons and controls should appear tangible, even though they are behind a layer of glass. In the physical world, buttons, controls and other objects respond to our interactions with them. People expect a similar level of responsiveness from the user interface controls. To bridge that gap, visual and motion cues acknowledge input immediately and animate in ways that look and feel like direct manipulation. Button is responding to the user\u2019s tap. Credits: Material\u00a0Design Visualize the results of the\u00a0actions Animations can enhance every point of interaction and reinforce the actions a user is preforming. In Stripe\u2019s example below, when the user clicks \u201cPay\u201d, a spinner briefly appears before the app shows the success state. Checkmark animation makes user feel like they easily did the payment and users do appreciate such important details. Visual response can increase engagement and delight the user.
