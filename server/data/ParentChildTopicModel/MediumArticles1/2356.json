His breakfast was coffee, which he prepared himself with great care\u200a\u2014\u200ahe determined that there should be sixty beans per cup, and he often counted them out one by one for a precise dose.

Rock solid productivity. Compare that to your average person\u2019s day: You have to give the man credit\u200a\u2014\u200ahe worked hard. Sometimes, the right answers are the obvious ones. If you aren\u2019t getting the results you want in work or life, maybe you simply aren\u2019t working hard enough. Over the years, I\u2019ve developed a simple method for (1) identifying my productivity \u201cblind spots\u201d and (2) replacing them with something better. 1. Track Your\u00a0Time Our memories are flawed. We tend to put a positive spin on everything. That\u2019s a great way to stay optimistic, but a terrible way to get results. The only way to stay honest is to track your time. For a week, track everything that you do. I like to do it in 15-minute blocks. Some options you can use for tracking: 2. Analyze After you track your time for week, review your records. Ask yourself: You might notice a pattern. The time you waste in a week will be spent on the same few activities. Usually, this is entertainment\u200a\u2014\u200aTV, social media, YouTube, etc. We can\u2019t tackle everything at once. Instead, we\u2019ll pick the 1\u20132 most damaging activities and tackle those. 3. Rewire\u00a0Habits Like heroin, bad habits are addictive. Instead of quitting cold, try to rewire your bad habits into good ones. It helps to write down your replacement triggers or say them out loud. What helps even more is removing bad options from the environment. Throw away your TV and put books in the house. Don\u2019t bring your wallet to work.

That\u2019s too bad, because it\u2019s the most important one. After your rewiring phase, pause and reflect. Did you succeed in replacing your bad habits? If not, why? Did you lack self control?
