With that in mind we created our signature feature, the visual annotations, but we do not stop there. The way the publishing environment is structured and the possibilities it offers and encourages can inhibit or nurture creativity.

Create Shows on specific\u00a0topics With the new feature you can create a feed separate from your personal profile. We call these feeds \u201cShows\u201d. Each Show has its own page people can follow, as well as its own RSS feed anyone can subscribe to. Basically, you can create an existence on its own, with a description, social media links, a URL of your choice and yourself as the Editor.

But even more importantly\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can also invite Contributors, who will be notified and can then do the same with their tapes. Just as pieces of a puzzle, by adding new creators to your show you can assemble a beautiful picture together, with different voices complementing each other on a given topic. It is also an almost effortless way of growing your audience and letting people discover you and your content in a fun, non-intrusive and hand-picked way. Your and your teammates tapes get exposure to each other\u2019s audiences. It\u2019s a win\u00a0win. This is what an Editor sees when (s)he goes on the page of the Show. The page is different from what a listener would see, with added admin options to manage all tapes, add/remove contributors and change settings. Our new advanced statistics are also available for Shows so once you kicked off your new Show, you can observe the audience development and behaviour from the very beginning, optimising the work of your team as you go. The advanced stats work perfectly for\u00a0Shows. Support us and get creative with unlimited storage The \u201cShows\u201d feature is part of the new TapeWrite Premium package, meaning that you can enjoy it at a small monthly price along with extended or unlimited hosting storage, depending on which plan fits you best.
