That\u2019s exactly what happened when Mudiay struggled this season; his 47.4 true shooting percentage and well-below-league-average 10.3 PER made Malone go looking for better options. Or at least more experienced ones. While Nelson\u2019s counting stats are hardly eye-popping (8.9 PPG, 5.1 APG), they don\u2019t need to be. As Malone pointed out, the Nuggets have plenty of scorers. What they needed was a steady presence to play a role, distribute, and hit an open 3 now and then (which Nelson is doing at a nearly 38 percent clip). \u201cHe\u2019s really kind of sacrificed his game,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s a scoring guard. He\u2019s a pick-and-roll player. But he understands with this team, he needs to be a facilitator, get us organized, cut, guard on the other end, and finish games.\u201d Indeed, when Nelson is off the court the Nuggets have a minus-3.3 net rating, per NBA.com. Conversely, the Nuggets are plus-2.2 when Mudiay sits. Mudiay is so marginalized at this point that the best he can hope for is one of those dreaded public attaboys from his coach for working hard and some garbage-time sympathy minutes now and again. The NBA gives no quarter for any reason, especially in a playoff race. About that last part: The Pelicans loss was a blow. There was no denying it. Mike Malone called it \u201cembarrassing,\u201d though he insisted he wouldn\u2019t overreact. Step back, he said, and you\u2019d see the Nuggets have \u201cplayed some great basketball and beaten some of the NBA\u2019s best teams\u201d lately. While Jokic and some other Nuggets fled the arena after the loss without talking to the media, the players who remained behind in the locker room didn\u2019t seem too shook. Gary Harris teased Jamal Murray about an unrelated matter. Will Barton combed his beard while explaining how eager he was to face the Blazers next. Wilson Chandler said aloud to no one in particular that the loss occurred at a bad time, then headed off to dinner with some of his teammates. Jameer Nelson just shrugged and admitted, \u201cIt happens.\u201d It does, though they probably wish it happened at some other point in the season. Tuesday\u2019s game in Portland marks the beginning of a brutal final slog for the Nuggets. They\u2019ll play five straight on the road, flying from the Pacific Northwest across the country to Charlotte in the process. There are two rematches with the Pelicans in there, and a game at Houston against the red-hot Rockets before they close out against full-tilt Russell Westbrook in OKC. Of the remaining nine games, only two are in Denver. As a result, FiveThirtyEight gives the Nuggets a 16 percent chance to secure the last postseason spot, while Portland is projected at 83 percent. If the Nuggets make the playoffs, it certainly won\u2019t be because the schedule makers made it easy. But then, as Malone conceded in an understatement the other night, \u201cIt\u2019s never easy in the NBA.\u201d ", "child": "95_1\t95_2\t95_3\t95_4\t95_5\t95_6\t95_7\t95_8\t95_9\t95_10\t95_11\t95_12"}
