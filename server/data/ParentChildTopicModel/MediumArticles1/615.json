Which leads me to my next point\u2026 Swearing is not always \u2018profanity\u2019 Let\u2019s unpack this a little, shall we? Profanity is the quality of being \u2018profane\u2019. \u2018Profane\u2019 means \u2018vulgar\u2019, \u2018obscene\u2019, \u2018lewd\u2019, and \u2018lacking good taste\u2019. There are certain times when anything BUT a swear word is profane, obscene, and lacking good\u00a0taste. If I walked up and slapped your kid in front of you for no reason, it would be inappropriate to say anything but, \u201cHey, fucker\u201d (or some version of that). On the other side of that coin, if you told me that you\u2019re having a baby, I\u2019m going to grab you by the shoulders and greet you with an emphatically unapologetic, \u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d (unless your other kid was around, then I\u2019d censor myself). I think what\u2019s more profane than swearing is fakery. I\u2019d rather be faced with someone who swears authentically rather than sensors himself in a fake, ungenuine, self-stifling way. I\u2019m not saying you HAVE to swear. I know a small handful of people who\u2019ve seemed to get by without it. But that\u2019s who they are. They\u2019re totally genuine, not putting on a show as a way of manipulating those around them to think that they\u2019re righteous, perfect, God-fearing people. Profanity to me is a disconnection with Self. Whether that results in swearing or not swearing is merely a byproduct of that misalignment. I think what\u2019s more profane than an honest, genuine, well-placed swear word is the nonsense spewing out of most mainstream media channels today.
