So I\u2019m going to do one of the many things which, as a non-male writer, feels terrible, and I\u2019m going to talk about my feelings. It feels bad to read a book by a straight cis man about misogyny. It feels bad when this book contains some relatively graphic depictions of sexual assault. This is par for the course, when the course is reading books and the par is the Western canon. What feels worse is having this man\u2019s work recommended to you, over and over, by men who have talked over you, talked down to you, coerced you into certain things, physically forced you into others, and devalued your opinion in ways too subtle to be worth explaining in an essay (as in the interviews, where the hideous men are the only characters we hear from). Either these Wallace-recommending men don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re the hideous men in question, or they think self-awareness is the best anyone could expect from them. In the second iteration of \u201cBrief Interviews,\u201d one of the interviewees says, in explaining a rape victim\u2019s revelation, \u201cyou can do anything to anybody or even to yourself if you want because who cares because what does it really matter because what are you anyway just this thing to shove a Jack Daniel\u2019s bottle into, and who cares if it\u2019s a bottle what difference does it make if it\u2019s a dick or a fist or a plumber\u2019s helper or this cane right here\u200a\u2014\u200awhat would it be like to be able to be like this?\u201d The interview culminates in the subject saying to the unnamed female interviewer, \u201cWhat if I did it to you? Right here? Raped you with a bottle? Do you think it\u2019d make any difference? Why? What are you? How do you know? You don\u2019t know shit.\u201d Wallace\u2019s writing is effective in that it invokes both familiarity and repulsion. He knew what he was doing and did it very well. Many of the stories upset me. Many contained beautiful sentences. All were intelligent. I laughed once. But why have so many men been so insistent that I should read his work? What do they think Wallace has to teach me? Why have so many men been so insistent that I should read his work? What do they think Wallace has to teach\u00a0me? Obviously work by women about sexual assault has received critical acclaim and attention (Morrison, Oates, Walker, to name a few). But men rarely recommend those books to me (excepting my dad, who gave me Morrison novels when I was a teenager), and as far as I can tell, men are far less likely to idolize those authors, aspire to their cultural status, or blatantly copy their stylistic idiosyncrasies. More mundanely, I\u2019ve never heard a woman express shock or horror on hearing that a man has never read Beloved. It wouldn\u2019t occur to most women to recommend books by women to men the way men recommend books by men to women. Civic Memory, Feminist FutureA personal and political history from Lidia Yuknavitchelectricliterature.com I opened this essay with the cocaine story because exploiting my own physical experiences, especially sexual, establishes and theoretically validates my reflexive resentment toward Wallace (by way of his fans) before anyone has time to question me. It also encourages continued scrolling. Then I considered cutting the paragraph because I don\u2019t necessarily want the internet to know that story. Now it does. Yet in either case, the choice was mine to make, and this is, of course, why it enrages me so much when men exploit women\u2019s sexual suffering for Art. It is enraging to have a straight man tell me a story about straight men telling stories to a woman about straight men acting like shitheads. I understand that this is the point of the text. I know. I understand that maybe other men wouldn\u2019t absorb the message unless it was being told to them by another, probably smarter and better educated man. But then why do men keep recommending his work to me? BECAUSE I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW. Let me condense Brief Interviews with Hideous Men to its most quintessential line: \u201cMen mostly are shit, you\u2019re right, heh heh.\u201d Fine, Wallace: you\u2019re right. Heh heh.
