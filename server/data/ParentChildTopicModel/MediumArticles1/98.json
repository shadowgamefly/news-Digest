That\u2019d be great because that would mean we get to have not only a (likely) Celtics-Cavs matchup in the conference finals, but also a Cavs-Raptors matchup in the second round. I would like to see that because the Raptors seem like they\u2019re good and fed up with the Cavs beating them in the playoffs. THAT SAID, I don\u2019t hate the idea of Giannis going yo-yo against the Raptors to stretch that series out, putting up something like 31\u201314\u20136 on the road in Game 7 for the upset, and then watching him try to stare down LeBron. I definitely do not hate that idea. ***It is a testament to the unending individual greatness of Russell Westbrook that there will be, I would estimate, several thousand conversations among basketball fans prior to the start of the Rockets-Thunder series where one person is like, \u201cThe only way the Thunder get past the Rockets is if Westbrook averages something like 60\u201320\u201315 for the series,\u201d and the other person is like, \u201cI mean\u00a0\u2026 let\u2019s not rule it out, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d The Utah Jazz: [Closes eyes so tightly that they almost fuse together.] Gordon Hayward averages 29.6 points in the Jazz-Clippers series in his playoffs coming-out party. \u2192 The Jazz beat the Clippers in six. \u2192 Hayward\u2019s confidence skyrockets. \u2192 The Jazz lose to the Warriors in the second round, but Hayward is devastating in the series, and becomes a national sensation. \u2192 Rudy Gobert averages eight blocks a game for both series. \u2192 He starts calling himself \u201cThe French Mark Eaton\u201d in interviews. \u2192 He, too, becomes a national sensation. \u2192 Sensing the team is about to make the jump, Hayward opts to sign an extension early to stay in Utah. \u2192 As a result, Utah signs a very solid, championship-pedigree free agent after the season (Andre Iguodala, perhaps). \u2192 They make it again to the second round of the playoffs, this time losing a heartbreaker Game 7 to the Spurs. \u2192 Chris Paul, an unrestricted free agent the following summer, goes to Utah. \u2192 And now it\u2019s a fucking problem for the rest of the league. \u2192 2019 Western Conference finals: Utah Jazz vs. Golden State Warriors. Group III: The\u00a0Stranger You\u2019re walking home. It\u2019s late at night. The streets are cold and dark and mostly empty. Mostly. There\u2019s a figure that you think has been following you. You cross the street to see what happens. Seconds later, the figure crosses, too. You can\u2019t say for certain it\u2019s following you and that it\u2019s going to hurt you, but you got a feeling. That\u2019s this team. The Los Angeles Clippers: Three things here: (1) All that I want is to see Chris Paul, the greatest point guard of his generation and also one of the greatest point guards of all time, play in a couple of capital-H, capital-S High-Stakes playoff games. That\u2019s it. It really doesn\u2019t seem like so much to ask. (2) What do you think is going to be the insane, bizarre, terrible, devastating way that the Clippers are going to fall apart in the playoffs this year? Some sort of fluke game (\u201cBORIS DIAW SCORED 54 IN GAME 6?????\u201d)? A freak injury (\u201cBLAKE GRIFFIN GOT TEMPORARY AMNESIA????\u201d)? The team plane flies to the wrong city? (3) Despite the universe\u2019s apparent joy in dicking over the Clippers, I just can\u2019t find it in myself to put a team with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and J.J. Redick any lower than Group III in this index. They won 50 games this season. That\u2019s not a small number.* *And yet, somehow it just feels so tiny. (Getty Images) Group IV: \u201cHello? 911! There\u2019s Someone in My\u00a0House!\u201d You\u2019re at home. Alone. It\u2019s the middle of the night. You\u2019re asleep. There\u2019s a noise. You\u2019re awoken. You hear another noise. Then several noises. You do that thing where you scrunch up your face because you\u2019re trying to be super good at hearing. You hear steps. There\u2019s definitely someone out there who shouldn\u2019t be out there. That\u2019s these teams. The Houston Rockets: The Rockets are one of the three most interesting teams in the playoffs this year for four different reasons: (1) The Rockets are making 3s at a historic clip (over 14 per game), and we\u2019ve already seen the Warriors shred the \u201cjump-shooting teams can\u2019t win championships\u201d thing, so who\u2019s to say the Rockets can\u2019t do it, too, what with them being even more jump-shoot-y than the Warriors have ever been. (2) James Harden, who was a human walking sigh by the end of last season, has been exquisite this season (averaging 29\u20138\u201311). And he\u2019s already mad that he\u2019s going to lose the MVP to Russell Westbrook, which means you can expect him to be at his absolute destruct-o-pettiest during the Rockets-Thunder first-round matchup. (3) Mike D\u2019Antoni is headed toward a second-round matchup against Gregg Popovich, and I just want to point that out in case you forgot that behind just about every great war is two wealthy white men trying to poke each other in the eye. And (4) THAT SAID, is anyone really afraid of the Rockets past the second round?* *I really like the Rockets As Punching-Up Underdogs story line in the playoffs this year. I think it fits them perfectly. Seems like I remember another Rockets team in that same exact role about 20-some-odd years ago\u00a0\u2026 The Boston Celtics: Just take the Rockets blurb, add in whatever you want for the first three points, and then end it with that same final point: Is anyone really afraid of the Celtics past the second round? The San Antonio Spurs: This breaks my heart, but\u00a0\u2026 just take the Celtics blurb from above that was a redo of the Rockets blurb, add in whatever you want for the first three points, and then end it with that same final point: Is anyone really afraid of the Spurs past the second round? (Getty Images) Group V: The Angry, Rabid Dog That Has You Trapped in Your\u00a0Car Have you ever seen Cujo? That\u2019s this group. That\u2019s this team. The Cleveland Cavaliers: They have lost 12 of their past 21 games, including the past three in a row, which they were very clearly trying to win so they could lock up the no. 1 seed, and so that\u2019s at least a little bit troubling. They have the ninth-worst defensive rating in the league. They are fighting with each other during games. It\u2019s all a mess. And yet, here they sit. Because they have LeBron James, the single most terrifying player in the league, and nobody else has LeBron James, the single most terrifying player in the league. (Getty Images) Group VI: The Texas Chain Saw\u00a0Massacre Let\u2019s check in with the narrator of a documentary about the Golden State Warriors: \u201cThe film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of five youths, in particular Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin. It is all the more tragic in that they were young. But, had they lived very, very long lives, they could not have expected nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day. For them, an idyllic summer-afternoon drive became a nightmare. The events of that day were to lead to the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history, the Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\u201d That\u2019s this team.
