With this short morning routine, your life will quickly change. It may seem like a long list. But in short, it\u2019s really quite simple: Let\u2019s begin: 1. Get A Healthy 7+ Hours of\u00a0Sleep Let\u2019s face it\u200a\u2014\u200aSleep is just as important as eating and drinking water.

In the long-run, your health will fall apart. The goal needs to be long-term sustainability. 2. Prayer and Meditation to Facilitate Clarity and Abundance After waking from a healthy and restful sleep session, prayer and meditation are crucial for orienting yourself toward the positive. What you focus on expands. Prayer and meditation facilitate intense gratitude for all that you have. Gratitude is having an abundance mindset. When you think abundantly, the world is your oyster. There is limitless opportunity and possibility for you. People are magnets. When you\u2019re grateful for what you have, you will attract more of the positive and good. Gratitude is contagious. Gratitude may be the most important key to success. It has been called the mother of all virtues. If you start every morning putting yourself in a space of gratitude and clarity, you will attract the best the world has to offer, and not get distracted. 3. Hard Physical\u00a0Activity Despite endless evidence of the need for exercise, only one-third of American men and women between the ages of 25 to 64 years engage in regular physical activity according to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s National Health Interview Survey. If you want to be among the healthy, happy, and productive people in the world, get in the habit of regular exercise. Many people go immediately to the gym to get their body moving. I have lately found that doing yard work in the wee hours of the morning generates an intense inflow of inspiration and clarity. Whatever your preference, get your body moving. Exercise has been found to decrease your chance of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is also related to higher success in your career. If you don\u2019t care about your body, every other aspect of your life will suffer. Humans are holistic beings. 4. Consume 30 Grams of\u00a0Protein Donald Layman, professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of Illinois, recommends consuming at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast. Similarly, Tim Ferriss, in his book, The 4-Hour Body, also recommends 30 grams of protein 30 minutes after waking up. According to Tim, his father did this and lost 19 pounds in one month. Protein-rich foods keep you full longer than other foods because they take longer to leave the stomach. Also, protein keeps blood-sugar levels steady, which prevents spikes in hunger. Eating protein first decreases your white carbohydrate cravings. These are the types of carbs that get you fat. Think bagels, toast, and donuts. Tim makes four recommendations for getting adequate protein in the morning: For people who avoid dairy, meat, and eggs, there are several plant-based proteins. Legumes, greens, nuts, and seeds all are rich in protein. 5. Take A Cold\u00a0Shower Tony Robbins starts every morning by jumping into a 57-degree Fahrenheit swimming pool. Why would he do such a thing? Cold water immersion radically facilitates physical and mental wellness.When practiced regularly, it provides long-lasting changes to your body\u2019s immune, lymphatic, circulatory and digestive systems that improve the quality of your life. It can also increase weight-loss because it boosts your metabolism.

If you follow a simple pattern, you can accomplish all of your goals, no matter how big they are. A fundamental aspect of that is writing them down and reviewing them every single day. 8. Do At Least One Thing Towards Long-Term Goals Willpower is like a muscle that depletes when it is exercised. Similarly, our ability to make high quality decisions becomes fatigued over time. The more decisions you make, the lower quality they become\u200a\u2014\u200athe weaker your willpower. Consequently, you need to do the hard stuff first thing in the morning. The important stuff. If you don\u2019t, it simply will not get done. By the end of your day, you\u2019ll be exhausted. You\u2019ll be fried. There will be a million reasons to just start tomorrow.
