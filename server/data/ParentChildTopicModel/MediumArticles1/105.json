Let everyone else rest. The Heat are losing weight. From the Department of Very Unfair\u00a0Things The KAT and Ricky\u00a0Show Katie Baker: There may have been some empty seats at the Target Center on Wednesday as the Timberwolves, 11th in the West, defeated the L.A. Clippers 107\u201391. But the people who did show up made sure to represent Minnesota with deep authenticity. This guy has definitely burned the roof of his mouth on a Juicy Lucy and gotten kicked out of a beer league hockey game in his day. The Karl-Anthony Towns dunk he was cheering came courtesy of Lance Stephenson\u2019s good-fundamentals bounce pass and resulted in two of Towns\u2019s 29 points in the win over the Clippers, whose odds of home court in the playoffs grow longer by the day. The near-unicorn Towns added 14 rebounds for his 100th career double-double and generally looked like a giant, freakishly coordinated child destroying his playdates on a minihoop. Towns joined teammate Ricky Rubio (15 points, 12 assists) in finishing with a double-double; it was Rubio\u2019s 15th on the season, though the far more interesting stat is that he hit his 42nd straight technical free throw. Rubio, whose playmaking lately has been among the league\u2019s best, celebrated these various feats by looking at Tyus Jones the way your boo better treat you, I swear.\u00a0\u2026 It also happens to be the inverse of the way Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau interacted with the officials all night. (I\u2019m not certain Thibs knows that his team won.) Ouchie The Wizards Can\u2019t Ease up Just\u00a0Yet Schube: After a Wizards loss early this season, our own Katie Baker reported on Wednesday, coach Scotty Brooks singled out John Wall\u2019s lackluster defensive performance. And, yes, the Wizards will need to be better than the middle-of-the-pack team they currently are on D if they want to make noise in the playoffs. But forget all that for a moment. Because Wall and the Wiz can blow the bloody doors off any arena on the offensive side of the ball, and that\u2019s exactly what they did Wednesday against the Nuggets in a 123\u2013113 victory. Wall had 30 points and 10 assists, and gave me reason to keep doubting that he\u2019s actually right-handed: Bradley Beal added 23, Otto Porter Jr. chipped in with 22, and Bojan Bogdanovic nailed one gorgeous bank shot out of Tim Duncan\u2019s Olde Tyme Book of Basket Ball Fundamentals. Of course, it helped that the Wiz played the Nuggets, who on this night were basically the C-plot on an episode of The Knick: It was ugly: lots of Jameer Nelson, who is still in the NBA, running in circles and taking contested layups, and plenty of effort from Some Plumlee Brother. The Denver Tubercular Ward made it a game in the second half, though. Jamal Murray was extremely warm, Gary Harris got straight hot, and Markieff Morris got himself tossed for tagging Mason Plumlee right in the\u00a0\u2026 plumlees. Washington fended the assault off with some useful D and plenty of ball movement, but the uneven second half served as a good reminder of Brooks\u2019s message. The Wizards can score with anybody. How they defend, though? As the season careens toward the playoffs, that\u2019s the thing worth watching. Rumble, Young Man,\u00a0Rumble Witness the Greg Monroeissaince Jonathan Tjarks: Giannis Antetokounmpo had another headline-making night on Wednesday, with an absurd 32 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, four steals, and two blocks in a 104\u201393 victory over the Knicks. Yet, somehow, he had a lower plus-minus (plus-10) than Greg Monroe (plus-15), who has quietly turned his career around in his second season in Milwaukee. The guy the Bucks couldn\u2019t give away at the start of the year has become one of their most valuable players: They have a net rating of plus-5.9 when he\u2019s on the floor. Giannis checks in at plus-2.5; the now-injured Jabari Parker is all the way down at minus-2.5. Monroe has been rejuvenated by a move to the bench, where he has been given the freedom to anchor the second-unit offense and not do as much on defense. Last season, the Bucks tried to integrate the lumbering Monroe into an aggressive scheme that asked their big men to hedge and recover on screens past the 3-point line. They weren\u2019t forcing a square peg through a round hole so much as through a hole that didn\u2019t even exist. But Monroe is playing closer to the basket this year, and the Bucks are funneling penetration to him rather than asking him to move his feet in space. Wednesday was another typical night for Monroe 2.0: 17 points, eight rebounds, and three assists in 29 minutes. He used his sheer mass (6-foot-11 and 265 pounds) to attack a smaller backup center (Kyle O\u2019Quinn) in the post, an area where he\u2019s much more efficient this season\u200a\u2014\u200ain part because he\u2019s not going up against starting-level centers as often. He also did a great job of rolling hard to the basket and creating passing lanes for Bucks players, as well as crashing the offensive boards and getting easy putbacks. Monroe has always been an offensive machine, and it\u2019s much easier to see that in his new role. The role of sixth man typically goes to shot-happy guards who struggle to defend: think Jamal Crawford, or new Houston teammates Eric Gordon and Lou Williams. Monroe, along with Zach Randolph and Enes Kanter, is blazing a trail for big men whose back-to-the-basket offensive games and inability to defend on the perimeter have turned them into anachronisms on a starting unit. Giannis has made the Leap this season, but the Bucks wouldn\u2019t be making a playoff push if not for the reinvention of Greg Monroe.
