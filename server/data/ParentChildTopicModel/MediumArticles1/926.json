After you check out the results, I\u2019d love for you to help me figure out why this is happening in the comments below. How we got the data: analyzing 30,469 segmented sales calls with\u00a0AI Before I jump into the results, let me outline how we did this. 30,469 B2B sales calls were recorded, speaker-separated, transcribed, and analyzed using Gong\u2019s self-learning conversation analytics engine. All of the calls that were analyzed were pulled from companies that are highly similar to each other\u200a\u2014\u200asame industry, similar sales cycle lengths and deal sizes, etc. Further, while we couldn\u2019t guarantee all of the sales reps had similar backgrounds and experience (realizing that\u2019s a key part to this story), the analysis was done on fully on-boarded reps rather than new sellers. Here are the patterns we\u2019ve found (so far). Who \u201clistens\u201d better: men or\u00a0women? If you look at the data (and nothing else), you would conclude that men listen better than women. In the analysis, men, on average had a 42:58 talk-to-listen ratio, while women averaged 46:54, talking 9% more often than men. Not a huge difference. But wait, there\u2019s more.\u00a0.\u00a0. Men interrupt their prospect an average of 4.2x per hour. Women? 6.3x per hour\u200a\u2014\u200aabout 50% more often. Men also pause before responding longer than women on average: 1.5 seconds vs. 1.3 seconds. And finally, women tend to go on \u201cmonologues\u201d longer (and more often) than men do. By \u201cmonologue,\u201d I mean an uninterrupted streak of talking without the customer chiming in. When men go off on a monologue, they average 116 seconds. Women average 130 seconds. If you\u2019ve spent much time in the sales profession, you\u2019d start to conclude that men are the superior salespeople after looking at this data. Which is why the next data point wracked my brain\u2026 Despite these \u201cbroken rules,\u201d women are closing more\u00a0deals Even though the above data paints women as lousy listeners, women progress deals to the next opportunity stage at a higher rate than men do. They also close deals at a higher and faster rate than men. In our dataset, men had a 49% likelihood of moving opportunities to the next stage, while women boasted 54%. And women\u2019s win-rates were 11% higher than men\u2019s (on average). Let\u2019s unpack what this could\u00a0mean Now that I just data-dumped you, let\u2019s think about what this could mean\u2026 Science consists of both the quantitative (data), and qualitative aspects of a problem. One without the other doesn\u2019t tell the full story. In this case, the quantitative side of the story is looking at sales conversation analytics. The qualitative side of the story is listening to sales call recordings or observing them live to investigate what\u2019s going on to flesh out the rest of the story. So, how are women breaking some of the traditional rules of selling, yet still getting more deals done? Despite the fact that the data paints men as better listeners than women, for all we know, men could be twiddling their thumbs, thinking about something else entirely while they\u2019re supposed to be listening to their customer. Silence is not the same thing as listening. Rambling versus persuading Tonni Bennett, VP Sales at Terminus had an interesting observation to offer. She provided an example that highlights how quantitative data only tells half of the story. It\u2019s important to also understand the quality of the call. She once had two reps that both talked too much on calls: a male and a female. When the male talked too much, he rambled on in a way that derailed the conversation and hurt his credibility. He would often answer simple \u201cyes/no questions\u201d with a long winded response that sparked more questions from the prospect. While the woman also talked too much, she was usually making persuasive, strong selling points or sharing a customer story instead of rambling and going off on tangents. Tossing nerf balls around the\u00a0office Another female sales leader I know made the observation that she often sees men tossing around nerf footballs while on the phone with their customers. How often do you see women doing something like that? Your observations While there could be hundreds of other qualitative explanations of this, I\u2019d like to save them for the comments.
