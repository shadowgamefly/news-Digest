I came to the first conclusion after scoring a few measly views for each post on my blog, during the first 6 months. The second came after digging into the numbers behind my blog\u2019s traffic on Google Analytics. Here, I landed 4x more visitors from a high authority site (Lifehack) compared to one that was less publicly known (Growmap). I\u2019m not saying you should toss away all guest post opportunities from lower authority sites\u200a\u2014\u200athey still bring you some decent traffic and a backlink! But you get a higher ROI for your blog if you invest your time writing for a high authority site. So how do you determine a high authority site? Alexa. Basically, Alexa ranks over 30 million websites based on their traffic data, which is gathered from millions of Internet users who use Alexa\u2019s toolbar. In other words, Alexa is a good indicator to see which site is popular. With that said, here are the top guest posting sites I highly recommend you submit your post to. These are all top sites, all of them ranked within the top 100,000 on Alexa, that should help boost your blog\u2019s organic traffic. 1.
