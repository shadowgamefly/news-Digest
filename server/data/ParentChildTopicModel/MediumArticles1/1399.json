We danced around each other\u2019s feelings in awkward moments of poorly timed jokes and forced laughter, much like how we did when we first met. Though, he never knew that it was a complete set up. During college, my best friend worked at a electronic store with Kevin. She had instructed me to come visit on a day when \u201cthe guy who is totally my type\u201d was working. I was desperate for a new phone and slightly desperate in general, so I visited. She motioned him over to where her and I stood, \u201cKevin, can you help my friend out, I need to help an annoying customer\u201d, she lied\u2013 winking at me as she walked away. \u201cSure,\u201d he replied, smiling and extending his hand for a handshake. He was far more handsome than she described. He was tall and thin, donned in a flannel shirt, wearing vintage glasses that drew me to his azure pigmented eyes. His beard was reddish, a color darker than his hair. He had a strong jaw and a short beard that nearly masked it. His face was kind, yet almost stoic, like a beautiful painting I wanted to touch. I left the store with a new phone and an invitation for a drink with the blue eyed salesman. Though it was unbeknown to me at the time, we began the best relationship I ever had. Kevin would visit me at my brewery job every weekend, waiting in a booth with an IPA and the New York Times in hand. He came to my house when my family lost power during Hurricane Sandy to bring me gluten free snacks and red wine. Another time, after a particularly long shift at work, he showed up just to bring me a leather bound notebook so I could write because he knew how much I loved it. Kevin was the best thing that ever happened to me in ways that I didn\u2019t realize until I had ended things in order to go to graduate school. He was moving to New York and I eventually moved to Washington, DC. It seemed logical, but somehow I never let go of him completely. He was consistently the man I always referenced\u2013 the baseline of how I should be treated or how someone should act. He was the benchmark of whom I wanted to share my life with, but I always felt too scared to ever ask if he\u2019d be willing to fulfill such a request. We remained distant and cordial friends through social media and birthday texts, but I always yearned for more. And so two years after my mistake to sever what we had cultivated, I sat across from him haunted by not only my decision, but by the reality of his health. I felt saddened, confused, angry, the feelings incapacitated my heart as I sat swirling my straw and faking smiles at him. I wanted to to tell him what I had hid, the feelings I had suppressed but somehow had bubbled to the surface as the timer seemed to ring\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I was too late. He asked me as the check arrived, \u201cWhat are you up to this week?\u201d \u201cNothing really, just visiting my parents until I have to head back to DC,\u201d I said, tucking a piece of hair behind my ears, \u201cWhy, um, what do you have planned? You\u2019re at work half time, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, I have Thursday off though to get chemo.\u201d \u201cWhere is it?\u201d \u201cSloan Kettering on 60th,\u201d he said, as if he was describing a grocery store. \u201cNice, umm, I mean, I could come, I mean if you\u2019re allowed visitors or something, I can bring food or whatever. You get hungry right? Is that a stupid question? Gosh, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know how to handle these things,\u201d I said, fumbling over words, my eyes watering as I said them. \u201cNo, no worries at all. I get it, I somehow feel used to it, but I get it, I do. But, yeah, why don\u2019t you come, we can make a day of it!\u201d he said, almost cheerfully. \u201cSounds good.\u201d I promised myself that night as he walked me to the train, that how I felt about him could no longer be what drove my actions. I had to remove my selfish motives and put his health first, put him above me. Whatever time he had left was precious and fleeting. We spent Thursday in a sterilized room sprawled out in hospital chairs, his had a hook where they hung the chemo bags. We ate gummy bears and burritos\u2013his favorite combination. I listened to his rants about what he wanted to do after he was finished with treatments. We made a list of places he would ride his motorcycle that he hadn\u2019t yet bought. \u201cI used to be scared of dying from an accident, now I almost want the chance,\u201d he explained. But then, as the day dragged into the late afternoon, the tone evolved like the liquid pulsing from the bag above him. While ripping open another bag of Haribos, \u201cMaybe I am saying these things because I know they may never happen. If I do make it, can you force me to get a tattoo?\u201d he paused, unsure of how serious the statement sounded. It was as if he wanted to drag our immature conversations back to the reality that we avoided. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t promise that,\u201d I replied, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t heard what kind of tattoo.\u00a0.\u00a0. that really changes whether I have a reason to care.\u201d He grasped at his stomach laughing, dropping two gelatin candies onto the laminate covered table, his IV drip dangled behind him like an accessory. I refused to let the circumstance harden him, so I kept going. \u201cI will agree if you promise to get a tramp stamp with a dolphin somewhere in it, then I will pay for it and drive you myself,\u201d I assured him. I felt elated that I could make him laugh, hoping that it would comfort him in some small way. \u201cHow about an NSYNC tattoo? The no strings attached album cover might be able to cover these scars pretty nicely,\u201d pointing to his stomach where the surgery would be. \u201cNow we are making a worthwhile deal,\u201d I chuckled, preventing myself from crying, I sighed after minutes of laughter, \u201cWhen is the surgery?\u201d \u201cOnce chemo ends.\u00a0.\u00a0.about six week or so,\u201d he looked at the nurse and she nodded, as if getting her permission. \u201cAre you scared for the surgery?\u201d almost immediately regretting the question as it left my lips. \u201cYeah, I think I am the most scared for that part.\u00a0.\u00a0. that\u2019s how my mom died you know\u201d \u201cI thought she died from cancer, just like.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d I trailed, not knowing what I meant to say. \u201cNo, well yes, but she died when she went in for her first surgery, she never came out. They said she bled out, I still am unsure why, I never asked my step dad or my dad, I just kind of accepted it in a way.\u201d \u201cKev, I\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \u201cI know, but it happened so long ago, it feels surreal at times, like thinking about how young she was when she died, about eight years older than I am now.\u201d I stared at him, waiting to think of something to say, anything to say. He looked down as if he knew I was at a loss for words, a loss for the ability to even imagine what he was implying. I ignored the distend of his cheeks and stomach from the medicine and the circles that drooped below his eyes and pretended that none of what I saw was really happening. \u201cI know you and you\u2019re going to be okay. In fact, you\u2019re going to get that damn tattoo if it is the last thing I do and I am totally going to have to pay for it, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I said, trying to hold back the pity behind sarcasm. \u201cDamn straight you will\u201d, he said, almost giving me attitude while smirking. I smiled back, unsure of what it was that I was feeling. I felt unsure about everything\u2013the future, his ability to handle what was happening, his chance of living, my inability to figure out a way to support him.\u00a0.\u00a0. I was a mess. I needed to figure it out, but I didn\u2019t know where to go in my mind, I couldn\u2019t even put one thought in logical order, it all felt like falling in love with him again\u2013messy and fucking terrifying. It was like throwing my heart back into the ring and knowing it wasn\u2019t coming back unscathed. Instead, I just observed him, like an art piece, smiling and absorbing all I could with my eyes\u2013 I knew I couldn\u2019t touch it, but only look from afar. He was this entity I could admire because everything about him made me happy, just by being close to him. I loved the way he made faces when I talked about annoying people or the way he listened to me without ever interrupting. I loved the freckles that decorated his nose. He was whole and finished, he was a symbol of perfection, but he was dying. Everything about the fluorescent lit room reminded me of being home. Not by the decor or the physical state, but a state indescribable by words. It was a state defined by the notion that I wanted nothing more from the world because it felt as if its entirety could fit in the chair across from me. In that small room, separated from the others with a rubber curtain, I wanted to not just turn back time, but hold it in place. I wanted to crawl back into a world that had us drinking cheap alcohol on a deck in a suburban sprawl where cancer hasn\u2019t yet arrived. I wanted to crawl into a time would when debating politics would be our most serious conversation. In that hospital room, I remembered that I so hopelessly wanted to crawl back. The last time I saw Kevin, his hair was growing in, even darker than I had remembered it; it was a lackluster shade of fall leaves, orange in hue. He looked young again, grinning proudly as he went to hug me. He looked happy, unfathomably happy. It felt as if the cancer never happened. His wrinkle-less eggshell colored shirt enticed me to finally tell him the truth \u201cSo, can we start over? Now that the worst is behind us, we overcame what most will never endure, can we give us one more chance? I still love you.\u201d We sat at a bar in midtown Manhattan, twenty blocks from the place we sat thirteen months before. We stared across at each other waiting for the server. So much had changed: he had chemotherapy, radiation and one intensive surgery. He almost died in the ICU due to complications that occurred, but against everything, he lived. Eventually, he went back to work full time, received a promotion at his job and moved to Brooklyn and started a new relationship. I had went back to school the summer he got the surgery. I kept in touch, sent a five pound package of gummy bears and wrote him often. Over that year, I kept my promise. Kevin didn\u2019t know how I still felt and he never would because he had endured enough. Kevin deserved a life that didn\u2019t involve his past and I was just that; a reminder of all that happened. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d I asked, my secret still hanging in the air. \u201cPretty good, everything has been going really well, I am off to visit my family in block island in a few weeks. Besides that everything is pretty normal. Work is work, it\u2019s still a job.\u201d He avoided the topic I desperately wanted him to reveal\u2013the girl he was seeing. I found out through social media, a public display that read: she\u2019s mine, and I want people to know. My visceral reaction when I saw the first picture of her was to throw the phone, but instead I just \u201cliked\u201d the picture. I gave an empty gesture to the sunset photo, where the mystery girl looked from a dock onto the water. The juxtaposition was of her and a pier at dusk, masking any details of her face. I kept staring at it, obsessing over every detail I couldn\u2019t see, my mind raced. It felt like a loss I hadn\u2019t prepared. I was jealous of her in a way, she got to meet him now, when he was ready, after he had been young, idealistic, broken, then horribly sick. Now he was wise, kind, more patient and well, he was him, but better. It was fucked up to entitle him as a better person, but he was new in ways most people never get. He eventually brought up her name casually as if it had been years, like she had been in his life all along. \u201cSo what does.\u00a0.\u00a0. Jessica do? What\u2019s she like?\u201d I asked. \u201cShe works on a blog in Brooklyn. She\u2019s nice, a year younger than me. She\u2019s from Long Island,\u201d as if he was reading her bio from the blog itself. \u201cMhmm,\u201d I nodded, \u201cvery cool.\u201d I pretended to be okay as I forced my teeth to be seen behind my glossed lips, poorly disguising my resentment. \u201cA fucking blog\u201d, I thought, nearly sputtering the words aloud\u2013 I hated her. Thinking of him and her as a collective noun made my palms grow sweaty. I kept imagining this life where they ride their bikes in tandem to the park on Saturdays after a long brunch with friends. I wanted to scream at him. I wanted to pull his face to mine so I could taste him. I just wanted to feel him one last time. I wanted more time with him than I got. I hated him for moving on and I hated myself for feeling this way. But, what I hated most was that I could never tell him how I felt because I knew that no beautiful string of words mustered together would change what had already occurred\u2013what had already formed our current lives. As if he could feel my discomfort, he assured me that they weren\u2019t serious; he explained that his new fling was merely a consequence of internet convenience and proximity. But, I heard the readiness in his tone. This was the opportunity he wished for in the hospital room, but instead of a motorcycle, he opted for a one speed bike and a normal life in New York. I sat on my side of the booth, hands at my side and yearned to tell him things I should have said long ago, but refrained. I was aware of my selfishness, but underneath the aggression was a comfort in knowing I got to be there, even if there was gone. That somehow the time we had was irreplaceable, despite how fickle it all felt in the moment. \u201cI am happy for you, Kev,\u201d I said painfully\u2013 feeling my heart ache inside my chest. It dropped low, like it may fall completely. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said in voice that bordered sadness, lined with a guilt. \u201cI am, I really am, I\u2019ve always wanted this for you, you know me, I always get overly emotional\u2013attached even,\u201d I explained, wanting him to know it was my issue, not his. \u201cAnd you know me, how I am, but know that nothing ever went wrong with us. I\u2019ll always think of us.\u00a0.\u00a0. always,\u201d he said like it was a way to preserve a piece of what we were. I felt settled in his words, like they unlocked a part of what I was looking for all this time, a contentment I didn\u2019t think I could find. As we left the bar, I ran my hands over his tweed blazer while I hugged him goodbye. Long ago was a hospital room and now was a future he never thought he\u2019d have. Our memories were haunting yet gloriously beautiful because in all of them he let me live a small speck of his fear. He held back the curtain into the death that he saw so closely and detailed. As my hands brushed the fabric delicately, I thought about the ten-inch scar that stretches from his rib cage to his groin and the hole in his bicep where they stuck the tube to get chemo into his body. I thought about all the things that hurt him to make him better, and I felt lucky. I felt lucky in that moment, to have seen and to have felt him \u2013to have felt a feeling that wasn\u2019t mine to feel. I felt humbled to have been there when he thought he was running out of time and to have been there, when he had come to realize he was going to have much more than he planned. I was comforted as I let go of his torso, my arms unwrapping from his back and my head lifting from his chest. I stood taller on my toes, lifting my heels to kiss his cheek softly, knowing that in a parallel place, in a tiny hospital room somewhere, Kevin and I exist. We exist laughing over tramp stamps and motorcycle trips with smuggled burritos in our hands. We only exist in a place that will never live beyond the fear that bound us to it. *The real name has been altered to protect the person, since this is a true account.
