None of those teams has a losing record! But it\u2019s \u2019Cuse, Pitt, Wake, and South Carolina. And then Clemson should play the leader of the Bad Division, which has no teams ranked in the top 20 at the moment. We like college football because random explosions happen, and there were plenty of them this Saturday, as four undefeated teams lost on the road to unranked opponents.

Over their past two games, they crushed Texas Tech and TCU. But the Mountaineers\u2019 dreams of an undefeated season died Saturday in Stillwater, as they lost 37\u201320 to Oklahoma State. I did not really like Baylor. In past seasons, they\u2019d been a fun team to root for, a college football outsider suddenly running up the score on the big boys. But with each week, we seem to learn new details about how the school and former coach Art Briles handled sexual assault allegations against football players. Each win became abhorrent. Of course, most people at Baylor were not responsible for these failings. But there were some people who made the conscious decision to value football success over the safety of women on campus, and I imagine in their warped worlds, the team\u2019s record validated their disgusting decision-making. Baylor fell this weekend, too, losing at Texas, 35\u201334. It would be hard to explain to somebody 10 years ago our surprise at scrappy underdog Texas pulling an upset over mighty Baylor, but, yeah, that\u2019s what happened. I\u2019m glad Baylor lost, and I\u2019m sure the people who would\u2019ve had to vote an undefeated Baylor into the College Football Playoff are glad Baylor lost, too. By the time the sun set on Big 12 country, the league was out of undefeated teams. Oklahoma is now in the driver\u2019s seat for the conference title, but the Sooners have already lost to Houston and Ohio State. I\u2019m sure there is some scenario in which the Big 12 gets a team into the playoff, but it would require a cataclysm in other leagues. Sexiest Dance [Grabs largest megaphone I can find] [Grabs obnoxiously loud air horn] GAME-WINNING SAFETY ALERT Y\u2019ALLLLLLLLLLLL Wyoming beat 13th-ranked Boise State 30\u201328 on Saturday after recording a safety in the final two minutes, and Cowboys defensive end Josiah Hall let loose one of the finest safety dances ever performed (non\u2013Men Without Hats category). The win had some national implications. The Broncos were previously undefeated and seemed ready to roll through the Mountain West and claim the New Year\u2019s Six bowl spot reserved for a non-power-conference team. With a loss to Boise\u2019s name, another set of Broncos takes over, as 8\u20130 Western Michigan assumes pole position for that spot. But forget about that, and let\u2019s focus on the happy night in Wyoming. This is a really hard place to win. There aren\u2019t many elite football recruits in Wyoming\u200a\u2014\u200athere aren\u2019t many people in Wyoming\u200a\u2014\u200aso Cowboys coaches have to convince talented young athletes to come live in the mountains, away from the people, things, and lifestyles that they love. Yet Craig Bohl, who built North Dakota State into an FCS powerhouse from 2003\u201313, seems to be finding success. Wyoming is now 6\u20132, and this was its first win over a ranked opponent since 2002. So dance, Wyoming. Do the sexy safety dance. Do whatever dance you feel like. Do they have new dances in Wyoming, or are young people in Laramie square dancing in the club? I dunno. If you gotta do the do-si-do, make it the most lit do-si-do of all time. Best Punt and Punt\u00a0Return Sometimes it\u2019s not what you do with the ball. It\u2019s what you do while voluntarily kicking the ball to your opponent. Dante Pettis (AP\u00a0Images) The no. 4 Washington Huskies have mushed over the rest of the Pac-12 this season and rode undefeated into a game against 17th-ranked Utah on Saturday. A lot of Washington\u2019s success has been due to the play of quarterback Jake Browning, its steady-armed stud under center. He wasn\u2019t at his best in this one\u200a\u2014\u200atying a season low of two touchdown passes while tossing his third interception of the year\u200a\u2014\u200abut he did make a pivotal play in the Huskies\u2019 31\u201324 win. With the game tied at 24 and 5:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, Washington faced a fourth-and-8 from the opposing 41-yard line. What do you do? Go for the long eight? Kick a 58-yard field goal? PUNT??!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! The Huskies acted like they\u2019d go with the first option, sending the offense onto the field, but Browning pooched the ball. And it was beautiful! It bounded down to the Utah 1-yard line. Did Browning\u2019s punt win Washington the game? No, it was a punt. You can\u2019t win on punts. But the punt put the Utes in a situation where they had to be conservative. They ran three straight ineffective plays, and their drive went only 2 yards. That meant they had to punt from the back of their own end zone, on a shorter snap than a punt would typically require. That meant they had to use extra blockers to prevent a disastrous block, and that meant they had nobody to cover the punt when it traveled really far. It also meant that Washington\u2019s Dante Pettis had plenty of room to return the punt 58 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Sometimes, punting can be winning. Best Comedy Until Saturday, I thought Notre Dame was a bad football team. But I realized I\u2019ve been underestimating the Fighting Irish. They\u2019re not bad at football. They\u2019re great at comedy. They\u2019ve got all the elements for a slapstick success: a coach whose face turns bright purple when he\u2019s upset; thousands of haughty fans who act stunned by the slightest hint of failure, leading to hilarious reactions as shovelfuls of failure are heaped upon them week after week; and most importantly, a team that\u2019s willing to commit to the bit. The Irish raced out to a 20\u20130 lead on Miami in Week 9. Then they blew it, and this muffed punt gave the Hurricanes a 27\u201320 lead. Why did punt returner C. J. Sanders think it was a good idea to try to grab a wobbly bouncing ball four yards from his end zone? Comedy, that\u2019s why. But Notre Dame used a 41-yard Josh Adams touchdown to tie things up in the fourth quarter, and shortly after had the ball on the goal line with under two minutes to go. It seemed like nothing could go wrong for the Irish: Either they\u2019d score a go-ahead touchdown, or run down the clock until they could kick a go-ahead field goal. But comedy is about surprise when you least expect it. So tight end Durham Smythe dove toward the end zone, allowing Miami to pop the ball loose and recover. Why did a tight end think it was a good idea to stretch for the goal line, considering a likely first-and-goal at the 1 with under two minutes remaining would have been a great situation? Look, comedies don\u2019t always make sense. Just laugh, okay? Notre Dame won, 30\u201327. But here\u2019s the punchline: It\u2019s still only 3\u20135. Biggest Heisman\u00a0Moment Fifth-ranked Louisville had a close call against Virginia, as the Cardinals trailed the Cavaliers 25\u201324 in the game\u2019s final two minutes. But Heisman Trophy favorite Lamar Jackson came to save the day with this absolutely gorgeous 29-yard touchdown pass to Jaylen Smith: Jackson has had one of the most magnificent seasons a quarterback can muster. He\u2019s been brilliant with his arm, he\u2019s been brilliant as a runner. He\u2019s been great against great teams, he\u2019s been great against good teams, and he\u2019s been great against bad teams. Most weeks, Jackson\u2019s contributed a bushel of touchdowns to give his team a comfortable lead in the closing seconds. I mean, Louisville beat Florida State by 43. Not Saturday. Against Virginia\u200a\u2014\u200awhich not only lost to FCS Richmond in the 2016 opener, but lost by 17 points to FCS Richmond\u200a\u2014\u200aJackson and the Cardinals struggled. They only managed seven points in the first half, their lowest output of the year, and Jackson didn\u2019t score a rushing touchdown for the first time all season in the 32\u201325 win. But this was his Heisman Moment. He showed that he is Clutch, and a Leader, and that he has Grit\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s much more important than anything else. Being talented enough to beat a preseason title contender by 40 is good, but being a Clutch Leader against one of the ACC\u2019s worst teams is somehow better. Most Disrespectful Moment Back in September, Kansas won its first game of the season. The Jayhawks finished 0\u201312 last year, so it was cause for celebration, and the students stormed the field. They have not won since. Let\u2019s check in on the team Kansas beat, FCS Rhode Island. JESUS. Unlike Kansas, James Madison\u2019s fans did not storm the field. This game was about as big a mismatch as hypothetically possible. The Rams came into Saturday with only one win on the season, against Brown\u200a\u2014\u200aan Ivy League team that can\u2019t offer its players scholarships. Meanwhile, James Madison had only one loss, against a pretty good FBS team, North Carolina. The quarterbacks\u2019 stat lines told the story of the afternoon: JMU\u2019s Bryan Schor went 21-of-22 for 309 yards with five touchdowns; Rhode Island\u2019s Jordan Vazzano went 4-of-25 for 12 yards with five interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. But whatever, those are just blowout numbers. Alarming, monstrous, blowout numbers, but blowout numbers nonetheless. Here\u2019s what was disrespectful: Up 84\u20137 with more than nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, James Madison drove the ball to the Rhode Island 2-yard line. The Dukes probably could have scored a 13th touchdown to extend their lead to 91\u20137, but instead they opted to kneel four times, intentionally taking a turnover on downs rather than trying to get into the end zone. Someone tweeted at me that James Madison running back Trai Sharp could have scored a touchdown on his 23-yard carry with 9:33 remaining in regulation, but intentionally slid at the 2-yard line. I know what you\u2019re thinking: Isn\u2019t it nice that the Dukes chose to call off the dogs with the result well in hand? Sure, sure, sure, quite sportsmanlike. People looking at the box score will see that James Madison scored only 84 points and not 90, which is a very rare amount of points for a college football team to score. As such, somebody looking at the box score might think that Rhode Island is just a regular amount of awful, not an earth-scorching amount of awful that causes crops to wilt and livestock to die. But to people watching the game? They knew. They saw that James Madison made it clear it could score 90, and probably 100, but then yelled \u201cHEY, I KNOW THAT I COULD TOTALLY SCORE RIGHT NOW, BUT I\u2019M NOT GOING TO, BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE SO BAD AT FOOTBALL THAT YOU CAN\u2019T STOP ME FROM SCORING YOURSELF.\u201d There\u2019s a difference between not running up the score and making a show of not scoring. If you did this to my team, I\u2019d fight you. I would admit my complete inability to beat you in football, and therefore I would fight you. This is football. Let me try to stop you. I don\u2019t need your mercy. Weirdest Play We\u2019re going to look at some NCAA Division III football here, specifically a game between the Belhaven Blazers and Hardin-Simmons Cowboys in Jackson, Mississippi. This is just ridiculous nonsense: On a fourth-down play, Belhaven quarterback Hunter McEachern threw a backward pass to fellow QB Clayton Webb, who was supposed to then throw a forward pass. But all of his receivers\u2019 routes were covered, so instead of passing, Webb decided to punt. His punt was pretty awful, barely reaching the first-down sticks, but it bounced off a Hardin-Simmons player and was recovered by Belhaven. Plays like this are why football is beautiful: Every part of it went poorly. The design was bad and the execution was worse, and yet it resulted in a massive success. The 1\u20137 Blazers are coached by Hal Mumme, who is famous in football circles for innovating a lot of the Air Raid offense. As tactically brilliant as Mumme is, even he knows he didn\u2019t draw the play up this way. Mumme hasn\u2019t really succeeded as a head coach anywhere, although he did win at least six games in two seasons at Kentucky, which is as good as winning a national title elsewhere. That\u2019s the standard at Belhaven, too\u200a\u2014\u200athe Blazers are now 5\u201324 in three seasons under Mumme, and lost this game, 55\u201321. At least something went right. Best Callback\u00a0Joke When Jackson threw the game-winning touchdown for Louisville, two Virginia fans did this: It mirrored the sadness of a Virginia fan from last season, when the Hoos lost to Notre Dame on a last-second touchdown pass: Perhaps the front row of Scott Stadium is just very conducive to this exact expression of despair, but it seems so convoluted: I\u2019ve been let down by sports millions of times\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m a Northwestern fan\u200a\u2014\u200aand I have never slumped my entire upper body and drooped my arms in utter sadness. I like to think these Virginia fans were paying homage. They saw their team lose in tragic fashion, remembered the grief of previous Sad UVA Guy, and knew it was the only way they could properly mourn. I like the idea that Virginia fans go to the games and think: \u201cWe\u2019re in the front row. If the Hoos find a devastating way to lose, we gotta do the slump.\u201d Almost Best Callback Joke\u00a0(Almost) This one requires some backstory. Last year, Utah hosted ESPN\u2019s College GameDay and one fan used the opportunity to call former Cal star Marshawn Lynch dumb on a sign. Unfortunately, that sign featured a grammatical error. It was a tremendous failure, the equivalent of telling somebody he\u2019s a bad driver by rolling down your window, sticking your entire upper body out, and yelling at him as your car veers into a ravine. It put a face to the millions of people who write \u201cYOUR A DUMBASS\u201d in online forums. This year, Utah tried to atone for its sign sins: This is a great sign\u200a\u2014\u200aself-deprecating, clever, and canonical. Good job, Utes! Unfortunately, it still includes a mistake. This sign is not better than \u201clast year.\u201d It is better than the sign from last year. It should say, \u201cThis sign is much better than last year\u2019s!\u201d If I\u2019m a school hosting GameDay, I\u2019m having an English professor stand at the set entrance to make sure that all the students\u2019 signs are grammatically correct. Can\u2019t be looking bad on national TV. Worst Callback\u00a0Joke Last October, Michigan lost to Michigan State on a dropped punt snap that the Spartans returned for a touchdown as the game clock expired. It was a big deal. So this year, Michigan State fans came ready to mock their in-state rivals for that memorable finish: Unfortunately, Michigan didn\u2019t punt a lot. The Wolverines scored on their first four drives, had the first half end during their fifth, threw a pick on their sixth, and kicked a field goal on their seventh. Michigan didn\u2019t punt for the first 51 minutes of Saturday\u2019s game. Then, with nine minutes left and Michigan winning 30\u201310, the Wolverines were forced to punt. Spartans fans got to unleash their chant. It kind of backfired. Michigan won, 32\u201323. Worst Math With Michigan State trailing Michigan 30\u201310 early in the fourth quarter, Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio asked his team to attempt a 34-yard field goal. Kicker Michael Geiger missed it. Dantonio later offered this explanation: If Geiger would have connected, that field goal would have taken a three-possession game and made it a three-possession game. He missed, though, so the contest remained a three-possession game. Just last week, Iowa\u2019s Kirk Ferentz referred to trailing by eight points as a two-score deficit. Someone should gather the 14 schools in the Big Ten to figure out why the league\u2019s coaches are so confused by numbers. Dantonio\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t so bad: The field goal attempt was on fourth-and-goal from the 17-yard line, meaning the Spartans would\u2019ve needed to pick up 17 yards or get zero points. But the math was awful. And, well, last week, Dantonio ran a fake field goal 28 yards from the end zone with one second remaining in the first half, passing up a good chance at three points for virtually zero chance at seven points. Sometimes, Dantonio bets the house; other times, he lets the house collapse around him. Worst Swag For the past few years, Illinois has worn \u201cGray Ghost\u201d uniforms on homecoming, a nod to one of the best players in program history, Red Grange. In 1924, Grange stunned defending champion Michigan with a six-touchdown homecoming performance, dealing the Wolverines their first loss in two years and prompting legendary sportswriter The Ringer\u200a\u2014\u200aerrr, sorry\u200a\u2014\u200aGrantland Rice to describe him as \u201ca streak of fire\u00a0\u2026 a gray ghost thrown into the game.\u201d The uniforms are a really cool way to honor a moment that time might have otherwise forgotten. Unfortunately, they\u2019re trash: I get it \u201cgray,\u201d as in \u201cgray ghost,\u201d but it seems more like Illinois is honoring the last time its football program was successful by making the team look like it\u2019s on black-and-white TV. Maybe go red for Red Grange next time? Best \u2018College GameDay\u2019\u00a0Sign You know what? So do I. ", "child": "2008_1\t2008_2\t2008_3\t2008_4"}
