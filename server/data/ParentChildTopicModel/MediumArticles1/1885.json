Cancer thrives on sugar, so the first thing Kerry did was pursue an aggressive diet heavy in fruits and vegetables with no refined sugar. Second, cancer cannot survive in a temperature exceeding 105 degrees Fahrenheit so Infusio uses a hyperthermia machine to direct the heat to one specific area in the body to fry the cancer cells while preserving all the normal cells around it.
