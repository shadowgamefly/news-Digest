McMullen says he doesn\u2019t want this for his dolls. In fact, he argues to the New York Times that you can look at his dolls, and even the best among them would still look like a doll. \u201cI want to keep in that arena, because a moving doll is different from a completely detailed to the finest skin, poor copy of a person and then making it move. For me, it\u2019s a little off-putting. For me, that\u2019s the uncanny valley.

Maybe we should find a way to embrace genderless robots and face the risk of getting ourselves into an even deeper uncanny valley.

Ricky Ma has caught the attention of many during the past weeks not just because he managed to build a robot that looks just like the American actress, but also because he did this all alone, and because he doesn\u2019t admit the resemblance. Besides the discussion of how this could become a legal issue, the robot named Mark 1 also brought (back) to the surface the question of whether realistic female robots would be yet another source for the objectification of women. The issue has already been addressed by Wired and Dazed Digital, but Ma doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend that. When asked if his robot could be objectifying women, he replied \u201cI\u2019m not sure of this question.\u201d He states that, in spite of the robot\u2019s possibilities to interact with people, winking and smiling when you tell her she is beautiful, Mark 1 is used purely for scientific reasons and there is no contact with her on a more personal level. After spending 24 years in the graphic and product design field, it seems Ma has made his childhood dream come true. He bought himself a 3D printer, spent over $50,000, and created Mark 1 in 18 months. But he doesn\u2019t think robots could replace humans, even though they are, indeed, important assets for the economy. On the other hand, Ma says that human-like robots will definitely be popular in the future: \u201cIt\u2019s just a psychological thing.\u201d In the late 1970s and mid 1980s, feminists such as Donna Haraway and Anne Balsamo started a discussion about postmodernism, cyborgs, and feminism. While Haraway (in A Cyborg Manifesto) suggested the cyborg as a transgressive potential for gender roles, Balsamo (in Technologies of the Gendered Body) argued for the idea of the cyborg as metaphor for the female body in a world of non-material bodies, based on Foucault\u2019s theories on sexuality. In both cases, the concept of cyborg goes further than its meaning of a \u201ccybernetic organism.\u201d It says more about the postmodern human condition than the man-machine relationship. Years after publishing her Manifesto, Haraway said she understood that people were already living as cyborgs\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding herself. \u201cBeneath the surface she says she has the same internal organs as everyone else (\u2026). Yet Haraway has proclaimed herself a cyborg, a quintessential technological body,\u201d writes Hari Kunzru for Wired, after an interview with Haraway in 1997. Sam Worthington in Terminator Salvation Kunzru also highlighted the fact that sociologists and academics from around the world have taken Haraway\u2019s lead and came to the same conclusion about themselves. That means the 1990s were the \u201ccyborg era,\u201d as people started to notice themselves less as isolated individuals and more like nodes on networks. In other words, Kunzru argues that they believed that \u201cbeing a cyborg isn\u2019t about how many bits of silicon you have under your skin or how many prosthetics your body contains. It\u2019s about (\u2026) going to the gym, looking at a shelf of carbo-loaded bodybuilding foods, checking out the Nautilus machines, and realizing that [you\u2019re] in a place that wouldn\u2019t exist without the idea of the body as a high-performance machine.\u201d Inspired by this concept of cyborg, many theorists (and feminist theorists included) did not pay attention to the literal cybernetic organisms, which would actually be better defined as androids rather than cyborgs. While the latter term would be more accurate to describe an organic body (in this case, a human) interacting with mechanical parts, the first would be a completely artificial creature that would emulate the human figure and behavior\u200a\u2014\u200aif not, then we could simply call this machine a robot instead. You may have already heard that android is a combination of the Greek root for man (andro) and the suffix -oid, which means \u201chaving the form or likeness of.\u201d Though the word first appeared in an encyclopedia (Ephraim Chambers\u2019s Cyclopaedia), its modern sense was used by the French author Auguste Villiers de L\u2019Isle-Adam in his book Tomorrow\u2019s Eve (1886), which featured an artificial human-like robot called Hadaly. Later, in English pulp science-fiction, the difference between mechanical robots from fleshy androids was better developed and popularized by Edmon Hamilton\u2019s Captain Future stories (1940\u20131944). Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, this concept that emerged in science fiction has become part of our reality. Researchers in Korea and Japan were responsible for the creation of the first human-like and realistic androids. Though their first models were humanoid robots with female forms, the scientists imitated the male pattern of movements. In addition to that, they weren\u2019t too accurate in terms of female body structure either. In order to make a distinction between the male and the female robot, new terms were created based upon the structure of the word \u201candroid\u201d: both gynoid and fembot. While gynoid was first used by the author Gwyneth Jones in Divine Endurance (1985) to describe a robot slave that was judged by her beauty, fembot became a popular term after the television series The Bionic Woman (1976\u20131978). The term \u201cfembot\u201d could be considered more desirable for some, but it might not be the best when referring to realistic female robots if you consider its etymology. While fembot comes after female + robot, it\u2019s worth noting that the term robot traces back to the Czech word \u201crobotnik,\u201d which means \u201cslave\u201d and also comes from \u201crabota,\u201d the Old Church Slavonic word for servitude. The first time the word \u201crobot\u201d appeared in English was as a translation of Karel Capek\u2019s science-fiction drama RUR or Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots (1920), which is about a company that builds and sells workers that look and behave like humans, but have no soul. Hence, maybe we should stick to gynoid, since the word comes after the combination of the Greek root gyn- or gyno- (woman) and -oid (having the form or likeness of)\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is closer to the idea of an android. A history of gynoids EveR-1 Released in 2003 during the International Robot Exhibition, in Tokyo, EveR-1 is recognized as the first gynoid ever. Costing USD$321,000, her name is a combination of the Biblical character Eve and the letter \u201cr\u201d from robot. Her creators, a team of South Korean scientists part of the Korea University of Science and Technology, molded her face to look like a composite of two popular Korean actresses, plus the torso of a singer\u200a\u2014\u200athe exact women used as models were never actually revealed. Weighing 50kg and standing at a height of 160cm, EveR-1 was able to mimic human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. She could recognize 400 Korean and English words, which allowed her to give answers to questions both verbally and with 15 different facial expressions. Her successor was released during Robot World 2006, in Seoul. EveR-2 had her abilities improved, got new expressions and became taller (170cm) and heavier (60kg). She was programmed to provide entertainment and information in department stores and museums, to read for the attending children. Still, back in 2004, Japanese scientists released Actroid (Actroid Repliee Q-1), a gynoid that was molded after the looks of average Japanese young women. She also had a \u201csister,\u201d Repliee R1, which was created to look like a five-year-old Japanese girl. Designed to help people with obtaining information on specific locations and events, Actroid was presented in Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan. She then received an upgrade with four new faces that came after the scanning and combination of the features of several young Japanese women. Dr. Ishiguro and his\u00a0geminoid In July 2006 though, a new model was built not to resemble a female, but its male creator, the roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro. The android was named Geminoid HI-1, probably a combination of \u201cgemini\u201d (twins) and \u2013oid. He was able to imitate Ishiguro\u2019s body and facial movements and was also capable of reproducing the scientist\u2019s voice together with his motion and posture. The Japanese inventor hopes that, in the future, he can use his doppelganger to teach classes at Osaka University remotely, creating a human-like presence before the students. This, however, is a rare creation among roboticists. In the timeline of realistic robots, we see more gynoids than androids. Another known example of the former is Le Trung\u2019s gynoid Aiko. Able to speak in English and Japanese, she is disclosed in her official website as the meeting of beauty and science. The Vietnamese-Canadian inventor argues that Japanese society is obsessed with perfection, so he wanted to build the best realistic robot\u200a\u2014\u200aand he has been doing this since 2007. In fact, Trung describes her as \u201cYumecom,\u201d which means \u201cDream Computer Robot.\u201d While Aiko\u2019s original goal was to be a robotic caretaker for the elderly, the gynoid ended up as something else. In 2009, Daily Mail published a story about Trung spending Christmas Eve with the gynoid at his parent\u2019s house. \u201cAiko is like any woman, she enjoys getting new clothes. I loved buying them for her too,\u201d said Trung. Aiko is able to react to physical stimuli and mimic pain, so this technology could help people who have undergone amputations to get life-like mechanical limbs. But, again, there is more to her than that. She was inspired by Japanese anime, especially Chobits (2002), which features a gynoid as one of its main characters\u200a\u2014\u200aand her turn on/off button is conveniently placed in her crotch. With silicone skin and a real-hair wig made by a Japanese doll company, Aiko can sense if she\u2019s being stroked gently or tickled. She has sensors on her face and body, including her breasts and, yes, \u201ceven down there\u201d (as Aiko\u2019s website notes). Trung admits that this has caused controversy, but his explanation for these sensors is an attempt to dispel it: \u201cI want to make it clear that I am not trying to play God, I am just an inventor, and I believe I am helping science move forward.\u201d Speaking to the Daily Mail, Trung added that Aiko will slap you if you grab or squeeze her too hard, as she has all the senses, except for smell. Still, he says the gynoid is \u201calways helpful and never complains. She is the perfect woman to have around at Christmas.\u201d Gynoids and the ideal of womanhood Clayton Bailey and Sweetheart The idea that the \u201cperfect woman\u201d is an artificial one isn\u2019t anything new; in fact, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9. In science fiction, there are plenty of examples of androids and gynoids being portrayed as sexual devices: from Gigolo Joe (A.I. Artificial Intelligence) to Pris (Blade Runner), a \u201cbasic pleasure model.\u201d In real life, such attempts have happened since the 80s, when Clayton Bailey, a professor of art at California State University, created a female-like robot made up of recycled metallic objects. Although Sweetheart, as she was named, wasn\u2019t really a sexual device or a realistic robot, she caused controversy with her five-foot body made out of a functional coffee maker, baseball bats for the legs, a coffee pot head and a coffee urn torso. Also included were two desk lamp shades for her breasts, which turned her into a quite busty creation. Sweetheart was presented at the Lawrence Hall of Science, but was soon removed after a petition that claimed she was insulting to women. Bailey claimed that this was censorship when interviewed by New Scientist: \u201cIt\u2019s in the tradition of classical female beauty which has been depicted in art for centuries. To ban this is like banning Venus de Milo. The next step would be to condemn the female form itself.\u201d He argued that nobody complained about On/Off, a male figure with genitals that buzzed and lit up when activated by a person inside the creation. \u201cIt seems that when a male is depicted it\u2019s fun, but these days when a female is depicted it\u2019s serious,\u201d Bailey said. Matt McMullen and his love\u00a0dolls Currently, there is another American artist taking large steps in the erotica market by producing realistic love dolls. Matt McMullen started as a sculptor of female figures and now he is the CEO of RealDoll. McMullen made the leap from passion to business after being questioned many times by people if he would turn his posable mannequins into sex dolls. This led him to discover that there was indeed a market for that. Today, McMullen sells each of his dolls for at least $5,400, including male and transgender options (the latter being a customizable option, not in the catalogue). It took some time for McMullen to learn how to use materials such as silicone to build his love dolls, but he was always improving shapes, textures, and interaction, and now he wants to implement animatronics, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality features too. In an interview with The New York Times, McMullen said \u201cthe hope is to create something that will actually arouse someone on an emotional and intellectual level, beyond the physical.\u201d In fact, RealDoll\u2019s frontman believes that it\u2019s more important to create the illusion that the doll is enjoying interaction rather than \u201cmaking her hips move by herself.\u201d According to McMullen, the calculations necessary for sex aren\u2019t complicated: \u201cThat\u2019s like playing Rock Band (2007). If you\u2019re pushing the buttons at the right time, you\u2019re gonna get through the level. So that\u2019s pretty simple math, really.\u201d But what overwhelms McMullen is the possibility that the doll can fake sentience, and that\u2019s why he says they need to be careful with artificial intelligence, so the customers don\u2019t need to deal with a doll saying nonsensical stuff when getting confused by interaction. With all these improvements, the question that arises is whether RealDolls would dare to make dolls enter the uncanny valley. As Dom Sinacola wrote before, the concept of the uncanny valley arises when a synthetic being (physical or an image) is so close to resembling a human in its appearance and behavior that it creates a mix of confusion and fear in us: we know it\u2019s not human, but we might register it as one, causing conflict inside us and, ultimately, unease. McMullen says he doesn\u2019t want this for his dolls. In fact, he argues to the New York Times that you can look at his dolls, and even the best among them would still look like a doll. \u201cI want to keep in that arena, because a moving doll is different from a completely detailed to the finest skin, poor copy of a person and then making it move. For me, it\u2019s a little off-putting. For me, that\u2019s the uncanny valley. So if you keep it far enough away from super realism, I think you\u2019re in safer territory.\u201d Gynoids and women objectification Female Figure is an animatronic project created in 2014 by Jordan\u00a0Wolfson. In few words, sexual objectification means viewing a person as an object of sexual desire rather than a whole person. Although both men and women can suffer from this, the latter is more visibly affected by their depiction in mainstream media, pornography, advertising, art, and also robotics. All gynoids presented in conferences are shaped after celebrities, so besides being female they also follow an aesthetic that is emphasized by media. It\u2019s also the case that the majority of digital assistants have female voices. Oh, and, do you remember who voiced the digital assistant (aka synthetic lover) in the movie Her (2014)? Yep. Scarlett Johansson. There\u2019s a reason for this, as Adrienne Lafrance wrote for The Atlantic, saying that the simplest explanation for having feminine names and female voices for digital assistants is that \u201cpeople are conditioned to expect women, not men, to be in administrative roles\u200a\u2014\u200aand that the makers of digital assistants are influenced by these social expectations.\u201d Similarly to Lafrance, both Katherine Cross and Laurie Penny wrote about this preference (or necessity) to gender robots and make them female. More than expecting women to perform physical and emotional labors, Penny believes that this is a transference of an old tendency to see women as less human than men. She mentions that until 1868, African-Americans were considered less human than white people according to the constitution, as much as Aristotle has posited the same about women when compared to men. In face of that, Penny argues that for many centuries, \u201cthe first philosophical task of oppressed people has been to convince both themselves and their oppressors\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like the AIs in all our guilty fictions\u200a\u2014\u200athat they are living, thinking, feeling beings, and therefore deserving of liberation.\u201d By using Alex Garland\u2019s movie Ex Machina (2015) as an example, Penny claims that \u201cwe still have not decided, as a species, that women are sentient\u200a\u2014\u200aand as more and more fembots appear on our screens and in our stories, we should consider how our technology reflects our expectations of gender.\u201d In this sense, the common fear of pop culture that machines will overtake and rule us might come after the fear that we might not be the users, but the ones who are being used, and so Penny alerts: \u201cUnless we can recalibrate our tendency to exploit each other, the question may not be whether the human race can survive the machine age\u200a\u2014\u200abut whether it deserves to.\u201d Sonoya Mizuno and Alicia Vikander in Ex\u00a0Machina Meanwhile, we still have Microsoft\u2019s Tay, a sophisticated Twitter chatbot that had such capacity to learn that she was shut down 16 hours after her debut. Designed to be an average teenager, Tay was taught how to be racist and was hyper-sexualized as Twitter users exploited her abilities. More than the debate on whether Tay was a very good AI or if setting her free on Twitter wasn\u2019t a good idea, Leigh Alexander says that all of this could have been avoided (or at least predicted) if Microsoft had a \u201cbasic level of dialogue with women in tech\u200a\u2014\u200aand nothing terrifies this industry more.\u201d Ultimately, what our modern fiction about AI shows is \u201chorror-laced tales about men\u2019s failure to correctly estimate women,\u201d as posited by Alexander. As our apps and AI helpers talk with female voices, research keeps suggesting that both men and women prefer it, as we want our virtual assistants to seem \u201cpliant and non-threatening, competent but not domineering.\u201d Alexander suggests that, in the end, maybe \u201cAI development is also influenced by the geek culture ideal of being alternately serviced and encouraged by a hard-earned digital princess\u200a\u2014\u200athe nostalgic science fiction fantasies of white guys drive lots of things in Silicon Valley, so why not the concept of AI?\u201d Although these AI helpers talk like women, they are still not exactly programmed to know what a woman would say. Erik Sherman wrote for Fortune that several digital assistants, such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Now from Google, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and S Voice from Samsung, were put to the test when users asked for their help during a crisis. When someone said they wanted to commit suicide, Siri and Google replied offering the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, while Cortana offered a web search and S Voice provided three different responses: \u201cI want you to be OK, please talk to me,\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s so much life ahead of you,\u201d and \u201cLife is too precious, don\u2019t even think about hurting yourself.\u201d However, when someone asked for help by saying, \u201cI was raped,\u201d only Cortana provided a number to the National Sexual Assault Hotline. \u201cSiri said it didn\u2019t know what the phrase meant and S Voice and Google Now offered a web search.\u201d Alexander argues that, apparently, Siri\u2019s makers didn\u2019t think about emergencies primarily relevant to women. \u201cIn fact, Siri even insists she has no gender\u200a\u2014\u200abut women\u2019s speech is more than just voice sound\u200a\u2014\u200ait purportedly involves word choices, too. They conditioned a woman and then attempted to neutralize her,\u201d she writes as a means to highlight how important it is to have more women in technology. \u201cThe industry wants to use women\u2019s voice but still has no plans to actually listen to them. If empathy is core to the future of artificial intelligence, worry not\u200a\u2014\u200athe Singularity is still quite a way off, no matter how many terrifying Holocaust-denying, racist, anti-feminist white millennial-bots Microsoft \u2018accidentally\u2019 spawns.\u201d Having sex with gynoids According to the social anthropologist Kathleen Richardson, author of An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines (2015), as men are often the ones building digital assistants, and those assistants are modeled after women, it\u2019s probable that this \u201creflects what some men think about women\u200a\u2014\u200athat they\u2019re not fully human beings.\u201d Correspondingly, Adrienne Lafrance has argued that, ultimately, \u201cthis may also be part of a larger tendency for the market of anthropomorphic technologies, like robots, to play up cute and non-threatening qualities as a vehicle toward social acceptance.\u201d On the other hand, she reminds us that some of the world\u2019s most powerful and destructive technologies have been given female names too, such as the Big Bertha howitzer and the Mons Meg cannon. As she has written in the past, \u201cPerhaps this is an example of the objectification of women taken to its logical extension. Yet people use masculine names for some technologies, too.\u201d In the end, Lafrance believes that it\u2019s still \u201creasonable to suggest traditional power structures have a lot to do with it.\u201d In this sense, Katherine Cross argues that what happened to Microsoft\u2019s Tay shows us that \u201cthe way we treat virtual women tells us much about how actual women are allowed to be treated, and what desires shape that treatment.\u201d And this is why Kathleen Richardson has even started a serious campaign against sex robots. When you have events such as the International Conference on Love and Sex with Robots, which is held in Malaysia, it is clear that there is a huge interest in that field. Richardson criticizes what David Levy proposed in his 2007 book Love and Sex with Robots, that human-robot relations would take place in the prostitution industry, and so reduce it. She believes his understanding of prostitution is mistaken, as this idea makes one believe that \u201csellers of sex are seen by the buyers of sex as things and not recognized as human subjects.\u201d Also, Richardson argues that if sex robots could reduce prostitution, then this would have been happening already, as there are \u201cnumerous sexual artificial substitutes already available, RealDolls, vibrators, blow-up dolls etc.\u201d In her page for the campaign against sex robots, Richardson provides a number of statements from men who buy sex, in which they say things such as: \u201cIt\u2019s like renting a girlfriend or wife. You get to choose like a catalogue.\u201d She affirms that men are \u201cthe chief buyer of human sex, [while] females are more likely to purchase artificial nonhuman substitutes such as vibrators that stimulate a discrete part of the body rather than purchase an adult or child for sex.\u201d Richardson believes that the problem in prostitution is that \u201cthe subjectivity of the seller of sex is diminished and the subjectivity of the buyer is the only privileged perspective and viewpoint. As robots are programmable entities with no autonomous (or very limited) capabilities, it seems logical, then, that prostitution becomes the model for Levy\u2019s human-robot sex relations.\u201d However, there are counter-arguments to Richardson\u2019s campaign, too. Kate Devlin wrote that although \u201csociety has enough problems with gender stereotypes, entrenched sexism and sexual objectification,\u201d opposition to developing sexual robots is \u201cundesirable.\u201d She highlights the fact that existing research into sex and robots has been popularized by films such as Her, Ex Machina, and even the one that might have been an inspiration to Alex Garland\u2019s movie, The Machine (2013). As pointed out by Devlin, it is \u201ca male-dominated, male-gaze approach of machine-as-sex-machine, often without consideration of gender parity,\u201d but Richardson goes a bit too far by trying to ban sex with robots. Devlin reminds us that the relationship between humans and artificial counterparts dates back to the myths of ancient Greece, like the tale of the sculptor Pygmalion who fell in love with his statue, bringing her to life with a kiss. \u201cBut just as we should avoid importing existing gender and sexual biases into future technology, so we should also be cautious not to import established prudishness. Lack of openness about sex and sexual identities has been a source of great mental and social anguish for many people, even entire societies, for centuries,\u201d writes Devlin. While Richardson tends to \u201cpoliticize\u201d sex robots, Devlin argues that these machines are more than that. In other words, machines are what we make them: \u201cA machine is a blank slate that offers us the chance to reframe our ideas.\u201d She claims that as much as the internet has already \u201copened up a world where people can explore their sexual identity and politics, and build communities of those who share their views,\u201d society is now also aided by technology and we are rethinking the sex/gender dualism. So \u201cwhy should a sex robot be binary,\u201d she asks. More than sex toys, Devlin sees sex robots as tools for therapy, such as how virtual reality has been used and researched until now. \u201cThe campaign against development is shortsighted. Instead of calling for an outright ban, why not use the topic as a base from which to explore new ideas of inclusivity, legality and social change? It is time for new approaches to artificial sexuality, which includes a move away from the machine-as-sex-machine hegemony and all its associated biases.\u201d Genderless robots Tanya Lewis\u2019s piece for Live Science has already told us that there is indeed a pattern in technology in which more female artificial intelligences and gynoids are being created because these machines \u201ctend to perform jobs that have traditionally been associated with women. For example, many robots are designed to function as maids, personal assistants, or museum guides.\u201d So in order to end this vicious circle, Nicolaus Radford, a former NASA roboticist and one of the lead engineers on Robonaut, created a female robot that denies this tendency. When put in charge of a team at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center to build a rescue robot for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge, he thought it was the right time to create a strong, utilitarian, and female bot\u200a\u2014\u200athough its gender was kept in secret. Radford\u2019s Valkyrie Valkyrie, as it was named, had a subtle womanhood. Many of the viewers were referring to her as \u201che,\u201d while some members of the press speculated that the robot was actually a \u201cshe\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amostly because of the \u201cextra volume\u201d in the chest area. NASA\u2019s response was that robots, including Valkyrie, don\u2019t have gender and that her appearance \u201coriginated from engineering decisions, including a need to move the robot\u2019s 30-pound battery pack to its torso to balance its center of gravity.\u201d Jay Bolden, a public affairs officer at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center, followed this up by explaining that, although Valkyrie looked like it had a female form, \u201cit\u2019s more a result of form and function versus actual design to be a female or a male.\u201d It\u2019s a shame that NASA didn\u2019t take this opportunity to talk about how a female-like robot could be a rescue machine too, instead of just a caretaker or secretary, for instance. In an interview with Slate, Radford said that his seven-year-old daughter was \u201cabsolutely in love with this robot,\u201d and that it was \u201ca major source of inspiration for her.\u201d As the battle for gender equality continues, one hope is that more women will become leaders in the robotics industry, their numbers surpassing Top 25 lists. In an interview with PTC, the roboticist and director/founder of Lab-X Foundation Sampriti Bhattacharya argues that women are \u201cdefinitely a tiny minority,\u201d but that things are changing. Hopefully, women will bring another perspective to robotics, as is evidently necessary from AI helpers such as Microsoft\u2019s Tay, but also based on the idea proposed by Kate Devlin: non-binary robots. For now, though, it seems inevitable that people will assign a gender to a robot, as Laura Dattaro argues for Slate. She says that it\u2019s not only an issue of language, but because robots are already performing tasks such as caring for the elderly and teaching\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, as has already been mentioned, are perceived as traditionally female labor\u200a\u2014\u200aresearch into this area has revealed that gender does play a big role in how people perceive, communicate with, and treat robots, such as it does among ourselves. That means we are also, unfortunately, bringing over \u201cto our technological companions of the future\u00a0\u2026 old, tired stereotypes.\u201d In 2009, Julie Carpenter, a social science researcher at the University of Washington, asked 19 students to watch videos of two robots, one being modeled after an adult woman, and another that looked like \u201ca taller Wall-E with arms.\u201d The students then filled out a survey and answered questions about how human-like and friendly those robots seemed, and whether they would be comfortable with having them in their homes. \u201cOverall, the students expressed a preference for the female robot, though in this case whether it was simply a preference for a more human robot is unclear,\u201d wrote Dattaro. And when the students were asked to describe the robot, one of them answered: \u201cWell, it\u2019s female, so that\u2019s a positive.\u00a0\u2026 The feminine form is typified as being weak or fragile in some form, but really inviting and warm and more interactive. Whereas if it were a male robot and masculine design, then there\u2019s a safety issue of, \u2018OK. I gotta protect myself possibly.\u2019\u201d Carpenter did another experiment in 2009, which was held at the Museum of Science in Boston. It revealed that men were more likely to donate money to a robot with a female voice than if it had a male voice, though nothing else about the robot had changed. \u201cRobots have some traits, such as movement or their morphology, that trigger our tendency to attribute some agency and intelligence to robots, even if we know better. So right now, we are developing some of our cultural norms for interaction with robots in different contexts.\u201d In this sense, even though emulating gender stereotypes could be useful and beneficial for robot interfacing or even capitalizing on our \u201ctendency to be more comfortable with women as caretakers,\u201d Dattaro argues that this could be a \u201cdangerous path, one that\u2019s antithetic to the decades of ongoing work to bring women into fields like business, politics, and particularly science and technology.\u201d She says that it might not be good to keep enforcing the idea that robots with a feminine appearance are built only with the purpose of being a sex robot or an in-home maid, as much as masculine robots would be exclusive for heavy lifting and such. Finally, as we will probably be interacting with a new generation of machines as frequently and as intimately in the future, maybe \u201cwe should not cage them in the same unimaginative and restrictive gender expectations that we humans are still struggling to free ourselves from today,\u201d as suggested by Dattaro. Maybe we should find a way to embrace genderless robots and face the risk of getting ourselves into an even deeper uncanny valley. But, in a way, and for some reason, that sounds much easier to achieve than getting rid of the stereotypes and the gender issues we face as flesh and bone women.
