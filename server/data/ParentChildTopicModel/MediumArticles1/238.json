For example, retail was entirely LD in 1990, but in sectors where depth of stock really matters (like books), there\u2019s already been a shift to location-independence. Even clothing, which used to be based entirely on trying things on in person, is becoming more reasonable to buy online, thanks to improvements in shipping logistics. Groceries are likely to be among the last to move, because they\u2019re bulky and often require refrigeration. But since demand for these types of retail is entirely local (for the same reason!), grocery jobs are tied to local population, and behave more like LD/people than LD/plant. Generally, any LD jobs which remain such because their consumers must be local behave like LD/people jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aeven subsistence agriculture."}, {"94c2": "Some jobs may even split up. Consider elementary and secondary education: teaching today is really a fusion of two jobs, teaching and child care. The former is potentially LI; the latter is firmly LD. But the separation of these jobs into two different things is already being pioneered by home-schooling co-ops. It\u2019s quite possible that we\u2019ll see these grow in popularity, and turn into a larger industry, and the skillset of teachers split into the two groups. This will be a very slow change, of course, since its impact on the profession is so profound; teachers essentially remain LD/people until such a time as this happens. (At which point, we\u2019ll likely see a great deal of hand-wringing about the two different \u201cclasses\u201d of teachers, their different social status and pay, and so on.)"}, {"bdda": "To summarize the economic transition: Between roughly 1930 and 1990, the industrialized world was dominated by LD/plant jobs. Offshoring made many of these jobs location-independent from the employer\u2019s perspective (you can manufacture things anywhere and ship them), but not from the employee\u2019s perspective (you still need a factory to work at). This was just a transition to automation, however, where low-end LD/plant jobs were replaced by machines, and LD/plant jobs are increasingly specialized jobs held by a small number of people. This led to LD/people jobs like the service sector becoming the dominant employers. But with the rise of warehouses, online trade, and telecommuting, we\u2019re moving into a world where most of the jobs are LI, and the second-most are LD/people\u200a\u2014\u200ajobs which are location-dependent because they have to be next to their customers. LD/plant jobs, jobs location-dependent because they have to be next to specialized equipment, are becoming more specialized and a smaller part of the total employment picture."}, {"5be9": "Different players in this period will see different effects. Cities and towns will no longer have the \u201ccompany town\u201d effect, both for good and for ill; the idea of luring a single employer for such purpose will become less tempting. This will also reduce the bargaining power of companies relative to locales, which may affect the \u201ctax incentive\u201d industry quite a bit as well, but it also reduces the ability of locales to create sudden giant improvements. Essentially, this shift moderates the large up- and down-swings of economies into a more stable middle."}, {"899b": "Workers will be differently positioned, too. Traditional techniques for organizing workers won\u2019t work when workers are spread around the world, but new ones likely will. (The union Slack channel?) Succeeding in LI jobs will likely require somewhat different skillsets as well\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g., ones around organization and communication. These aren\u2019t highly specialized, but they will impose a cultural penalty on people who don\u2019t have them. Generational shift will almost certainly play a role."}, {"93f1": "More broadly, this will interact in complicated ways with existing social stratification. To work from home, for example, you need a partially quiet home. People who don\u2019t have access to this, because of homelessness or a large number of children they\u2019re responsible for, are likely to be excluded from an LI economy. Likewise, telecommuting will require some basic equipment, and it\u2019s quite possible that (especially at the lower end of the economy) companies will either require people to have it, or lease it to them at usurious rates, creating a sort of \u201ccompany store\u201d effect. This is likely to be a significant way in which companies oppress their employees."}, {"0b6f": "A few things we do now can significantly affect that. For example, if we move towards relatively open standards of hardware for telecommuting, so that it works from any standard computer or smartphone, there\u2019s both less opportunity to require people to rent expensive, specialized goods, and more opportunity for \u201cwork centers\u201d where such equipment is available by the hour. Such centers are actually an advantage for everyone, not just people with low incomes: they\u2019re the extension of modern co-working spaces, and are quite good for people who would like to telecommute, but not necessarily work from home."}, {"3d8f": "It is certain that, whatever happens, it will split along existing cultural and economic lines; the strong will try to use it to exploit the weak. But the possibility of creating local economic stability, and exiting the local busts which have devastated so many communities around the world (from collapsed company towns in Midwestern America to fields fallowed by drought in eastern Syria) creates a real option for this to do the opposite as well."}, {"c118": "The Long Term: 2035 and\u00a0Beyond"}, {"ff1b": "Economics, over time, becomes culture. America\u2019s modern culture was profoundly shaped by a few transitions between 1930 and 1955: the mass migration of nuclear families in search of (LD) work during the Depression, the huge rise in factory labor in the postwar period, and the rise of the \u201ccorporate welfare state,\u201d where public benefits like health care and retirement were mediated through employers, were all created then. This also enabled the very specific racial and gender lines of the 20th century: those factory jobs with access to social benefits were specifically limited to white men, with the expectation that white women would acquire them as dependents. (The deal of excluding non-white communities from benefits was key to passing many of the basic laws powering these, especially during the New Deal.)"}, {"2441": "The entry of women into the workforce, the end of the strange period where factory labor could move you into the middle class (think for a moment: when in history, apart from roughly 1945\u20131975, was such a thing even possible?

This doesn\u2019t just reverse the primary impetus of the major migrations of the 1930\u2019s; it may have significant effects on transnational migrations, at least ones for economic reasons. If people are fleeing poverty, and their homes still have reliable access to food, shelter, and security, then landing a relatively small amount of infrastructure can then effectively connect them to a global economy."}, {"dbfa": "A likely impact is that Generation A (the one just being born now, entering the workforce en masse late in the economic shift phase) is going to be far less concerned with moving to places for work, and far more concerned with where they live for other reasons. In the developed world, this could reverse the trend of nuclear families; staying close to your extended family suddenly makes a lot more sense. It could also lead to a decentralization of cities."}, {"c63e": "This is likely to have far-reaching impacts which are hard to guess. Cities have several advantages around infrastructure concentration and causing people to interact with a wide range of people; but this latter advantage might be replaced by online interaction through work. Alternatively, it might not, leading to increased tribalism as people live only near people familiar to them. Suburbs, exurbs, and the countryside, on the other hand, have advantages around quality of life; these are likely to become substantially more appealing if not counterbalanced by a lack of (LD) work."}, {"22f4": "Most interesting to me are the impacts on class, race, gender, and the like, but I don\u2019t know how to predict this. Will LI jobs have strong de facto racial or class barriers, like LD/plant jobs did in the 1950\u2019s, or will the changing requirements and generations move us to entirely different social schisms? It\u2019s hard to tell."}, {"89fd": "But for once, I\u2019m glad to be telling an economic story about the future which contains a real option for good news."}], "content": "The Future of Telecommuting Potentially Positive Economic\u00a0News? There\u2019s a common theme in news analysis about the economy: it tells you about how some new development will prove excellent for the rich, terrible for everyone else, and help bring about the decline of civilization. So it\u2019s a bit hard for me to say this, but I think there may be some actually positive news all around for once\u200a\u2014\u200aand it has to do with a change in telecommuting. The story begins with the graph above, which comes from Christopher Groskopf\u2019s recent article about the rise of telecommuting among software engineers.

The rest of this article will consist of me prognosticating; you should take it as seriously as you take any other so-called \u201cthink piece\u201d about the future, that is, with a large grain of salt. \u201cFoolhardy economic and technological prognostication.\u201d (Opens envelope) \u201cWhat is the largest growth industry of the early 21st century?\u201d With apologies to Johnny Carson, whose \u201cCarnac the Magnificent\u201d set the standard for thinkpieces for a generation to\u00a0come. This seems to split into three natural periods: the adoption phase, in which telecommuting starts to penetrate more industries, over the next 10\u201315 years; the economic shift phase, in which local economies react to having entirely different pressures, maybe between 2025 and 2035; and the long-term phase, where those changes in turn start to affect culture and society.

Adoption Phase: Now\u200a\u2014\u200a2030 The toolchain for telecommuting isn\u2019t complete yet (notably absent: a distributed whiteboard that doesn\u2019t suck), but by 2017 it\u2019s already suitable for a range of jobs. However, companies aren\u2019t going to change their behavior overnight; even a shift to telecommuting being acceptable tends to take about five years once a company has decided to do it, and it does require changes in all sorts of details of how people do things.

This will likely persist well into later phases, when new generations start spinning up businesses and not caring about those established norms. The existing business owners will be furious. But ultimately, any industry which can adopt telecommuting likely will, because it gives workers more flexibility and employers less costs. Economic Shifts: 2025\u20132040 What\u2019s interesting about this is that this creates a new economic axis which separates industries, much like \u201cblue-collar\u201d and \u201cwhite-collar\u201d did in the early 20th century: location-dependent (LD) and location-independent (LI) jobs. Jobs are generally location-dependent if they either involve operating a specific physical plant (manufacturing in a factory, agriculture, running a datacenter, working in a retail store) or physical interaction with people (child care, medicine). The set of location-dependent jobs would change over time, both because of industry adoption, and because changes in various industries may make things less location-dependent, as has been happening in retail. What\u2019s interesting is that this means some big, and potentially positive, changes for local economies. Say we\u2019re in the year 2035. By now, gen X is retiring, Millenials and gen Z are the senior people in offices, and the generation after Z\u200a\u2014\u200atoday\u2019s toddlers, let\u2019s call them gen A\u200a\u2014\u200ais entering the workforce in large numbers. Jobs which were LD just because of slow adoption of telecommuting by X\u2019ers and Boomers are now LI; the remaining LD jobs are either tied to physical plants, or to people. Physical plant LD jobs, though, are likely to be much smaller in number. These are precisely the jobs which have been most effectively automated in past decades; a modern factory or dockyard requires a small number of highly skilled workers, not a large number of low-skilled workers. By 2035, it\u2019s likely that most other plant management jobs, from warehouse management to agriculture, will have done the same. So even though these \u201cLD/plant\u201d jobs will be localized, they won\u2019t be a huge part of most local economies, since they just won\u2019t employ that many people. (Note, by the way, that the American jobs which moved to China over the years have started to leave China as well. Many of them aren\u2019t moving to Malaysia or elsewhere in Southeast Asia; they\u2019re simply disappearing outright, in favor of machines. Offshoring was simply a precursor to automation.) This means that industry economic cycles, and collapses of individual employers, no longer also mean the collapse of local economies, which can trigger the collapse of local infrastructure (social and physical), and ultimately make places even less suitable for companies to land. An LI-dominated economy is likely to have fewer geographically-localized disasters. Contrast this with LI jobs.

That gives them more economic stability as well. For some jobs, it\u2019s hard to tell which category they\u2019ll land in, but this three-way division still seems to work. For example, retail was entirely LD in 1990, but in sectors where depth of stock really matters (like books), there\u2019s already been a shift to location-independence. Even clothing, which used to be based entirely on trying things on in person, is becoming more reasonable to buy online, thanks to improvements in shipping logistics. Groceries are likely to be among the last to move, because they\u2019re bulky and often require refrigeration. But since demand for these types of retail is entirely local (for the same reason!), grocery jobs are tied to local population, and behave more like LD/people than LD/plant. Generally, any LD jobs which remain such because their consumers must be local behave like LD/people jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aeven subsistence agriculture. Some jobs may even split up. Consider elementary and secondary education: teaching today is really a fusion of two jobs, teaching and child care. The former is potentially LI; the latter is firmly LD. But the separation of these jobs into two different things is already being pioneered by home-schooling co-ops. It\u2019s quite possible that we\u2019ll see these grow in popularity, and turn into a larger industry, and the skillset of teachers split into the two groups. This will be a very slow change, of course, since its impact on the profession is so profound; teachers essentially remain LD/people until such a time as this happens. (At which point, we\u2019ll likely see a great deal of hand-wringing about the two different \u201cclasses\u201d of teachers, their different social status and pay, and so on.) To summarize the economic transition: Between roughly 1930 and 1990, the industrialized world was dominated by LD/plant jobs. Offshoring made many of these jobs location-independent from the employer\u2019s perspective (you can manufacture things anywhere and ship them), but not from the employee\u2019s perspective (you still need a factory to work at). This was just a transition to automation, however, where low-end LD/plant jobs were replaced by machines, and LD/plant jobs are increasingly specialized jobs held by a small number of people. This led to LD/people jobs like the service sector becoming the dominant employers. But with the rise of warehouses, online trade, and telecommuting, we\u2019re moving into a world where most of the jobs are LI, and the second-most are LD/people\u200a\u2014\u200ajobs which are location-dependent because they have to be next to their customers. LD/plant jobs, jobs location-dependent because they have to be next to specialized equipment, are becoming more specialized and a smaller part of the total employment picture. Different players in this period will see different effects. Cities and towns will no longer have the \u201ccompany town\u201d effect, both for good and for ill; the idea of luring a single employer for such purpose will become less tempting. This will also reduce the bargaining power of companies relative to locales, which may affect the \u201ctax incentive\u201d industry quite a bit as well, but it also reduces the ability of locales to create sudden giant improvements. Essentially, this shift moderates the large up- and down-swings of economies into a more stable middle. Workers will be differently positioned, too. Traditional techniques for organizing workers won\u2019t work when workers are spread around the world, but new ones likely will. (The union Slack channel?) Succeeding in LI jobs will likely require somewhat different skillsets as well\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g., ones around organization and communication. These aren\u2019t highly specialized, but they will impose a cultural penalty on people who don\u2019t have them. Generational shift will almost certainly play a role. More broadly, this will interact in complicated ways with existing social stratification. To work from home, for example, you need a partially quiet home. People who don\u2019t have access to this, because of homelessness or a large number of children they\u2019re responsible for, are likely to be excluded from an LI economy. Likewise, telecommuting will require some basic equipment, and it\u2019s quite possible that (especially at the lower end of the economy) companies will either require people to have it, or lease it to them at usurious rates, creating a sort of \u201ccompany store\u201d effect. This is likely to be a significant way in which companies oppress their employees. A few things we do now can significantly affect that. For example, if we move towards relatively open standards of hardware for telecommuting, so that it works from any standard computer or smartphone, there\u2019s both less opportunity to require people to rent expensive, specialized goods, and more opportunity for \u201cwork centers\u201d where such equipment is available by the hour. Such centers are actually an advantage for everyone, not just people with low incomes: they\u2019re the extension of modern co-working spaces, and are quite good for people who would like to telecommute, but not necessarily work from home. It is certain that, whatever happens, it will split along existing cultural and economic lines; the strong will try to use it to exploit the weak. But the possibility of creating local economic stability, and exiting the local busts which have devastated so many communities around the world (from collapsed company towns in Midwestern America to fields fallowed by drought in eastern Syria) creates a real option for this to do the opposite as well. The Long Term: 2035 and\u00a0Beyond Economics, over time, becomes culture. America\u2019s modern culture was profoundly shaped by a few transitions between 1930 and 1955: the mass migration of nuclear families in search of (LD) work during the Depression, the huge rise in factory labor in the postwar period, and the rise of the \u201ccorporate welfare state,\u201d where public benefits like health care and retirement were mediated through employers, were all created then. This also enabled the very specific racial and gender lines of the 20th century: those factory jobs with access to social benefits were specifically limited to white men, with the expectation that white women would acquire them as dependents. (The deal of excluding non-white communities from benefits was key to passing many of the basic laws powering these, especially during the New Deal.) The entry of women into the workforce, the end of the strange period where factory labor could move you into the middle class (think for a moment: when in history, apart from roughly 1945\u20131975, was such a thing even possible? We have the phrase \u201cworking class\u201d for a reason), the collapse of large-scale industrial labor, and the rise of global trade making such labor location-independent from the employer\u2019s perspective, but not the employee\u2019s, shook all of the basic principles of this. What happens in a post-telecommuting world? Unlike today\u2019s LD/plant-dominated world, in this world there\u2019s a lot less reason to move to a particular place for\u00a0work. The impetus for cultural changes is that we now have an economy (not just in the United States, but across the world) broken roughly into three subsets: LI jobs, the bulk of work at all socioeconomic levels; LD/plant jobs, a small and specialized set of jobs increasingly at the middle to high end of the spectrum; and LD/people jobs, likely to weight towards the lower end of the economic spectrum, defined by needing to be physically next to their customers, a smaller but significant set of jobs. Unlike today\u2019s LD/plant-dominated world, in this world there\u2019s a lot less reason to move to a particular place for work. This doesn\u2019t just reverse the primary impetus of the major migrations of the 1930\u2019s; it may have significant effects on transnational migrations, at least ones for economic reasons. If people are fleeing poverty, and their homes still have reliable access to food, shelter, and security, then landing a relatively small amount of infrastructure can then effectively connect them to a global economy. A likely impact is that Generation A (the one just being born now, entering the workforce en masse late in the economic shift phase) is going to be far less concerned with moving to places for work, and far more concerned with where they live for other reasons. In the developed world, this could reverse the trend of nuclear families; staying close to your extended family suddenly makes a lot more sense. It could also lead to a decentralization of cities. This is likely to have far-reaching impacts which are hard to guess. Cities have several advantages around infrastructure concentration and causing people to interact with a wide range of people; but this latter advantage might be replaced by online interaction through work. Alternatively, it might not, leading to increased tribalism as people live only near people familiar to them. Suburbs, exurbs, and the countryside, on the other hand, have advantages around quality of life; these are likely to become substantially more appealing if not counterbalanced by a lack of (LD) work. Most interesting to me are the impacts on class, race, gender, and the like, but I don\u2019t know how to predict this. Will LI jobs have strong de facto racial or class barriers, like LD/plant jobs did in the 1950\u2019s, or will the changing requirements and generations move us to entirely different social schisms? It\u2019s hard to tell. But for once, I\u2019m glad to be telling an economic story about the future which contains a real option for good news.
