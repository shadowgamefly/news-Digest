Stories is the place to find your sea legs. More on whom to follow later. The third part of Snapchat is \u201clive stories,\u201d which are awesome. They are either the local, geo-coded area you\u2019re in or a world event. Right now mine shows the Miami GOP Debate because that just happened and \u201cKobe/LeBron: The Finale.\u201d Think of this area almost like \u201cTwitter Moments\u201d if you know that product or trending. When the Paris massacre was happening I found this to be the single best source to get a quick sense of what was happening on the ground by everybody who was Snapping from Paris. It really was the best place on the Internet to get a sense. Better than FB, Twitter or any news site. This is a hidden story most don\u2019t understand. The fourth part is \u201cdiscover\u201d and this is the professional media part of Snapchat that you barely knew existed but your younger peers certainly know about. It has Vice, Tastemade, Vox, ESPN, Comedy Central, BuzzFeed and more. The final part of Snapchat for now is the most hidden and is a lot of fun, which is the secret part of Snapchat where you can take photos or videos of people with rainbows coming out of their mouths or do the \u201chead swap\u201d that you probably saw in the press. For now, avoid this until you grok the basics, which as a reminder is STORIES. Navigation The first time you use a video game it\u2019s really hard to program in your brain what each button or joystick does. The Xbox has X,Y,A,B plus bumpers and joysticks. Yet a few weeks in your mind automatically controls to joystick without thinking about it. So, too, Snapchat. Snapchat\u2019s navigation is through \u201cswiping\u201d but they leave breadcrumb clues of how to navigate that also work by clicking (for novices). The starting screen every time is the camera. This is the dog whistle. It\u2019s the frequency designed to keep old people out and keep the product cool and hip for young people. And make sure they can use Snapchat without mom & dad wanting to send Snaps to their friends or snoop on them. It\u2019s super ironic because while Twitter is busy trying to simplify its product for newbies Snapchat is trying to do the exact opposite. It\u2019s worth pondering. Open Snapchat. Look at the top of your screen in the middle and you\u2019ll see the Snapchat ghost. If you click on that it will take you to your personal home page on Snapchat. If it\u2019s just white nothing has changed and if it\u2019s a white ghost with a yellow box around it you have new followers. You can click on the ghost to \u201cnavigate up\u201d or when you get better at Snapchat you\u2019ll simply \u201cswipe down\u201d but both actions take you to your home screen. Here you should see your ghost (which you can personalize or add a picture to) in the middle. That\u2019s how others will see you when they search for you. You can change your name if you want to be called something else in the app. Below your name (and that of others) is a number and it took me for freaking ever to figure out WTF this was. It\u2019s your Snapchat \u201cscore,\u201d which is just a measure of how much you actually engage in the app. If you send and receive a ton of private messages to others your score will be high and if you don\u2019t, it won\u2019t. Don\u2019t worry about this. But if you DO see somebody with a high score then you can assume they\u2019re a power user\u200a\u2014\u200aat least worth knowing. Yes, I was up early this morning. If you\u2019re newer to Snapchat you obviously want to add some friends so you can click on that button. The easiest is obviously to add from your Address Book because that\u2019s where you can find out whom you know that actually has downloaded the app and may or may not use it. And of course you can add by user name (mine is msuster). This is also where you can share out your user name with friends or on Twitter by clicking the \u201cShare Username\u201d button that will allow you to text, email, Tweet, FB or just copy your user name to share with others. Ok. So here\u2019s how most newbies get forked. Now I\u2019m on the \u201cAdd Friends\u201d page and like the joystick in a video game I have no idea how to \u201cget back\u201d or ever where I\u2019m actually supposed to go. Fear not. Follow the breadcrumb. If you look in the top left you\u2019ll see the left arrow that guides you what to do next or when you become a pro you\u2019ll know to swipe right. You\u2019re back at your personal home page. Click on the top right tool button and you\u2019ll see your settings with your user name, birth date, email account, etc. This is where you also control whether any user can send you a Snap (think text or photo message) or just friends. This will say whether anybody can view your stories or just friends. Beyond some basics don\u2019t yet worry about settings. You can play around more with it once you grok the app. Breadcrumb nav top left and you\u2019re back at your user page. While there is more you can do on this page it\u2019s not important for now. Look for the breadcrumb nav out, which is at the bottom center. If you click it you are page at the \u201chome screen\u201d which is for you to take a photo or video. Pro users will \u201cswipe up.\u201d For now you\u2019re not going to take a photo or video but I\u2019ll come back to that. Remember Snapchat is about swiping for quick nav with breadcrumb nav clues for novices. If you look at the bottom of your screen you\u2019ll see buttons in each bottom corner. If you click on the bottom right it\u2019s the same as \u201cswipe left\u201d and if you click in the bottom left it\u2019s the same as \u201cswipe right\u201d so if you ever forget what to do you can click those. Let me tell you that as a beginner all the real stuff will come from swiping left (clicking the bottom right). Try that now. If you swiped left you\u2019re at the stories page. Here you\u2019ll see recent stories from people you follow. Some regular VC or tech people putting out stories include me, Justin Kan, Gary Vaynerchuk, Chris Sacca and several others. Probably the best known person now on Snapchat is Dj Khaled. He\u2019s worth following for now if for no other reason than he\u2019s prolific so you can follow how some people use stories. Frankly, the more tech equivalent and easier understood by you is probably Gary V. But when you hear everybody talking about \u201ckey\u201d or using the key symbol that\u2019s Dj Khaled. Or when you hear people saying, \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to have\u00a0\u2026\u201d that\u2019s Khaled, too. As in, \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to have a nice beautiful breakfast. But you gotta have it\u201d or \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to be healthy. But get on the treadmill.\u201d My thinking? They don\u2019t want you to use Snapchat. Use Snapchat. Trust me. Stick with it the same way you \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d Twitter in 2007 when you signed up but by 2009 you were using it effortlessly. When you\u2019re watching a story it will be either text or video. It could be one photo/video or 20 in a row. I have been using it like a short video blog where I\u2019ll take a topic and put out 10\u201315, 10-second videos on topics like Fund Raising, Tech PR, Recruiting or just \u201cA day in the life of a VC.\u201d Sometimes I interview tech friends. The beauty of the medium is the time constraint like Twitter. Because each video is only 10 seconds it forces you to get to the point. While you\u2019re watching if you want to \u201cfast forward\u201d you simply click on the photo or video and it skips to the next segment. So if I shot 15 short videos and you click on number 8 it will skip the remainder of that video and go to 9. If you want to cancel out of the entire story simply scroll down and it will take you back to the main stories page. Swipe left again (or if you look in the top right corner you\u2019ll see the reminder breadcrumb nav with the \u201cDiscover logo\u201d that you can press to take you to the Discover page. Here you\u2019ll see the professional and curated content. Yes, this is where your kids or nephews are reading news and watching comedy. Click on Tastemade\u200a\u2014\u200aone of my favorite channels. It\u2019s the Millennial version of The Food Network. It takes a while to figure out the nav of Discover but once you do it\u2019s a fun way to consume media. You may not be in the age to want to watch media like this but if you are in a job that requires you to understand the future of media and tech products you should at least force yourself to \u201cget it\u201d before moving on. You swipe left to see more videos or swipe right to go back to the last video. It is just a teaser on the main left/right axis. To watch a video or read a story (if it\u2019s text) you scroll up. Now you\u2019re watching Snapchat media videos that you barely knew even existed. Still think Snapchat is just for sexting? Scroll down to get out of that video, down again to get back to the main Discover page and if you forget what to do you can see the breadcrumb nav in the left as a guide to remind you to swipe right (or click on that nav) and you\u2019re back to stories. Swipe right again and you\u2019re back to the camera. For Slightly More Experienced Users Ok. You have the basics. But there is more. Swipe right from the home screen (the photo / video taking screen) and you\u2019ll see your messages if you have any. It\u2019s impossible to know what do to as a newbie. So let me hack through it for you. If you have a blue solid square it\u2019s a text message sent to you. It could be a group message or just for you. Snapchat doesn\u2019t tell you that, which is a product flaw they need to fix. If you see a red square it\u2019s a photo that was sent to you. If it\u2019s purple it\u2019s a video that has audio so it\u2019s a warning that you need to turn on your sound before clicking on it (or that you shouldn\u2019t open it if you\u2019re in a public setting where volume is inappropriate). If you have any blue messages here you can swipe right on them to read the message. Be careful. Once you come back to this message in the future it\u2019s gone. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s an ephemeral network. The beauty is that you can send a message to a person that disappears unlike a normal text. Call this an \u201cadvanced use case.\u201d But you can read this message and reply by typing and then hitting \u201csend\u201d in the bottom right. If you type and then hit the yellow button in the middle it will add your text to a picture of yourself. Don\u2019t do that for now if you\u2019re a newbie\u00a0:) Once done look at the top nav for breadcrumb clues. If you click the hamburger in the top left corner it will show you more details about the person who sent you the message. It\u2019s an easy way to follow somebody or to block them if they send you something inappropriate. Once you\u2019re read a message the person who sent it will be able to know. They also can know if you never read it. It\u2019s also important for you to know that if you ever take a screen grab of any message (text, photo, story, whatever) the person who created that message is alerted. It\u2019s ok to take a screen grab (it\u2019s even considered a sign of flattery within Snapchat etiquette) but just know people will know. To send somebody a message click on the top left nav of the messages screen, search for a name, click on their user name and it will put you in the messages screen. There are several hidden features here (like sending files from your phone) but I\u2019ll save those until you\u2019re an expert. More Advanced Users Ok. My guess is that you\u2019ll want to be a lurker for a while and consume media before producing your own stories. And you probably should learn the basics of sending texts, photos and videos to a few friends before publishing stories. But let me at least tell you how. The first thing you do is shoot video or a photo on the home screen. You can shoot in front of you or click the top right nav to go into selfie mode. As an experiment just take a photo\u200a\u2014\u200aI promise it won\u2019t get sent anywhere. Now you see a static image. If you click the top left \u201cx\u201d it will cancel the image (or video) so you can retake it. Look at the top right. You can type text over it by hitting the T or add an emoticon by hitting the palette left of the T. If you click the crayon to the right of the T you can draw/scribble on the photo. Look at the bottom left. The number tells you how long that photo will appear before disappearing in your story or in your personal message to friends. You can set it between 1\u201310 seconds. Immediately to the right is a bit of magic. It\u2019s the ability to save the photo or video to your camera roll WITHOUT it being saved in Snapchat or being sent to friends. This is a very useful feature once you\u2019re an expert. I won\u2019t elaborate now. Immediately to the right of the local save is the \u201cadd to stories\u201d button. This is a short cut to save your photo/video to a story. Click on this\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can still go back. I promise! It usually gives you the ability to add to \u201cmy story\u201d or to a local geo-coded story (mine shows \u201cOur LA Local Story\u201d). If you want to \u201cpublish\u201d you click on the chevron in the bottom right so don\u2019t click that if you don\u2019t want to publish. You can click the top left \u201cx\u201d to bail out. But this is the quick way to send something to a story. Here\u2019s the really, really nice thing about stories. You can publish a photo and you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re spamming anybody. Either they decide to watch your story or they don\u2019t! It\u2019s like Twitter or FB that way. No consumer will feel bothered by the fact that you published this. Some will see it, some won\u2019t. It will be live for 24 hours and then disappear. Or you can delete it if you want to take it down. Cancel out and then take another photo. This time instead of hitting the \u201cadd to stories\u201d tab click on the bottom right chevron. Now you see all the people in you\u2019ve added on Snapchat whom you can send messages to. If you click on the square to the right of their name it will prompt you to send them the photo or video in their private messages area. If you click on many people it will send it to all of them but not like a \u201cgroup message\u201d more like a 1-to-many message. In fact, they won\u2019t necessarily know you sent it to multiple people. And from this screen you can also publish to your own personal story. Super Advanced Now let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re a ninja and sending out Stories. If you swipe left from the home page (which remember is where you take photos / videos) then you\u2019ll see \u201cMy Story\u201d with all of your contributions over the past 24 hours. To the right My Story you see three dots in a column. If you click on that it shows you all of your individual photos / videos and show you how many times each has been seen or snapped. I\u2019m showing you mine right now. See each of these videos has been seen between by between 1,000\u20131,100 people and screen grabbed by 10\u201320. It tells me what time I uploaded thus I know what time this part of the story will disappear. I can click on the eyeball at it tells me exactly who watched my video and who snapped it. That\u2019s pretty cool! Swipe down to get back to your stories page. And if you see a little down arrow to the right of your My Story and click it then it saves your entire story to your local camera roll. Thus I\u2019ve saved all of my Snapstorms to my local camera roll and uploaded them to Dropbox. So I\u2019ll be publishing them in the future on a more permanent location. For now I\u2019m enjoying the fact that if people want to see them they need to turn in daily. The End As usual I wrote this in one sitting with no editing. I\u2019ve just been dying to find the time to write a how-to guide for many of my friends who don\u2019t get Snapchat. I promise to write more about how to get the most out of it and why I think it\u2019s important for media. In fact, it\u2019s the most important tool for media to come along since Twitter, FB, YouTube and Netflix. But I promise to elaborate another day. I also have a bunch of screen shots I can add to this post but I gotta get ready for work so I\u2019ll try to add later. And yes\u200a\u2014\u200aI know I need to plug in my mobile phone. Trust me, this will really bother people with OCD\u00a0:) Sorry. And don\u2019t forget to follow me to get a sense of how Snapchat stories work: https://www.snapchat.com/add/msuster And please don\u2019t forget to forward this post to a friend if you got any value. Thank you! P.S. I\u2019ll clean up any errors or typos later. Feel free to alert me in comments section. P.P.S. No, I don\u2019t take pitches on Snapchat. I do respond to messages when I can. I can\u2019t always. I have met people on Snapchat and moved the conversation to email and even phone. It\u2019s just like Twitter. I just met an entrepreneur in Kuwait and we\u2019re now connected on email. I met another in Chicago who I\u2019m going to see when I\u2019m there in May. I\u2019ve chatted with several from Israel, Ghana, South Africa, New Zealand\u200a\u2014\u200ayou name it. Like every other network my followers are entrepreneurs so it\u2019s a perfect place for me to engage. And until I persuade more VCs to engage I feel like it\u2019s a playground I have mostly to myself! ", "child": "2422_1\t2422_2\t2422_3\t2422_4"}
