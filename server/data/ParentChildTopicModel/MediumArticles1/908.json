Grey No matter what you want to accomplish in life, it\u2019s going to involve discomfort: A great career or business requires hard work. A healthy body needs exercise and foods you don\u2019t necessarily like. Meaningful relationships need vulnerability and compromises. In fact, anything worthwhile often requires that you do what you don\u2019t want to do. And that can be hard. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. You Are Not Your\u00a0Thoughts I used to take my thoughts very seriously. Whenever one of them popped into my head, I\u2019d immediately identify with it and perceive it as the \u201ctruth.\u201d If a thought told me I was tired and bored, I\u2019d immediately look for a way out. But I\u2019ve since learned that I am not my thoughts and that my mind is nothing more than a suggestion box. Because of that, I don\u2019t take my thoughts as seriously as I used to. And that, in turn, has made a huge difference in my subsequent behavior and the results I get. These days, when my mind tells me I\u2019m restless and should do something else, I simply thank it for the suggestion and then get back to the task at hand. Stimulus \u2013> Perception \u2013>\u00a0Response It\u2019s never the discomfort that stops you; it\u2019s how you perceive the discomfort. Your beliefs determine your response, and what you choose to believe is within your control. You can assign whatever meaning you want to discomfort. I used to believe it was a signal that I should stop. These days, I believe it\u2019s a signal that I should keep going. I\u2019ve decided that anytime I feel discomfort, that just means I\u2019ve stepped into my mental gym and that it\u2019s time for my mental resistance training. Exercise Your Willpower Muscle Willpower is a lot like muscle power. The more you exercise it, the stronger it will get. If you practice it for an extended period of time, you can change your behavior around completely. You\u2019ll be able to do what others dread doing and to stay away from things that others can\u2019t resist doing. That level of self-control is exactly what\u2019s needed to become a remarkable person and create extraordinary results. So, how do you get started? Practice Voluntary Discomfort He who sweats more in training bleeds less in war.\u200a\u2014\u200aSpartan Warrior Creed The best way to practice mental resistance training is through voluntary hardship. Here are a few examples: These are just a few ideas to help you come up with your personal mental resistance training. The important thing is that you choose one and commit to it. And just like in a physical gym, you don\u2019t want to use the heaviest weights right away. There\u2019s no point getting overwhelmed or injured. So, start small and then get a little bit every day. If your willpower muscle is weak right now, it\u2019s perfectly fine to start by making your bed each morning. Or reading one page in a book. Or flossing one tooth. How to Do What You Don\u2019t Want to\u00a0Do If you\u2019re thinking to yourself right now; \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of person who practices voluntary discomfort,\u201d be very mindful of the fact that this is the same voice you want to take control over. Don\u2019t take it as literal truth. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just a suggestion. And it\u2019s entirely within your power what you do with that suggestion. If you choose to take action despite what your mind is telling you, it holds no power over you. You can decide to perceive discomfort as mental resistance training from this moment forward. And each time you push through the resistance, you\u2019ll notice that you\u2019ll get a little bit stronger. If you stick to the practice consistently, with time, it\u2019ll become second nature to do what you don\u2019t want to do. You\u2019ll become a relentless action-taker. And that\u2019s when you can turn your most desired goals into reality. If you enjoyed this article, please click the heart so others can learn from it as\u00a0well!
