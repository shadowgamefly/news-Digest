Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make \u201cfree\u201d choices, while we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn\u2019t choose in the first place. This is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you choose. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how deep this insight is. When people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask: How empowering is this menu of choices for the need, \u201cI ran out of toothpaste\u201d? For example, imagine you\u2019re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list of bars. The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones comparing bars. They scrutinize the photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this menu still relevant to the original desire of the group? It\u2019s not that bars aren\u2019t a good choice, it\u2019s that Yelp substituted the group\u2019s original question (\u201cwhere can we go to keep talking?\u201d) with a different question (\u201cwhat\u2019s a bar with good photos of cocktails?\u201d) all by shaping the menu. Moreover, the group falls for the illusion that Yelp\u2019s menu represents a complete set of choices for where to go. While looking down at their phones, they don\u2019t see the park across the street with a band playing live music. They miss the pop-up gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee. Neither of those show up on Yelp\u2019s menu.

Hijack #2: Put a Slot Machine In a Billion\u00a0Pockets If you\u2019re an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a slot machine. The average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do this? Are we making 150 conscious choices? How often do you check your email per\u00a0day? One major reason why is the #1 psychological ingredient in slot machines: intermittent variable rewards. If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is link a user\u2019s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable. Does this effect really work on people? Yes. Slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks combined.

For example, they could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for when they want to check \u201cslot machine\u201d apps, and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those times. Hijack #3: Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI) Another way apps and websites hijack people\u2019s minds is by inducing a \u201c1% chance you could be missing something important.\u201d If I convince you that I\u2019m a channel for important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities\u200a\u2014\u200ait will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account\u200a\u2014\u200abecause (aha, I win) you might miss something important: But if we zoom into that fear, we\u2019ll discover that it\u2019s unbounded: we\u2019ll always miss something important at any point when we stop using something. But living moment to moment with the fear of missing something isn\u2019t how we\u2019re built to live. And it\u2019s amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up from the illusion. When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from those notifications, or go to Camp Grounded\u200a\u2014\u200athe concerns we thought we\u2019d have don\u2019t actually happen. We don\u2019t miss what we don\u2019t see. The thought, \u201cwhat if I miss something important?\u201d is generated in advance of unplugging, unsubscribing, or turning off\u200a\u2014\u200anot after. Imagine if tech companies recognized that, and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we define as \u201ctime well spent\u201d for our lives, instead of in terms of what we might miss. Hijack #4: Social\u00a0Approval Easily one of the most persuasive things a human being can\u00a0receive. We\u2019re all vulnerable to social approval. The need to belong, to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations. But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies. When I get tagged by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a conscious choice to tag me. But I don\u2019t see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first place. Facebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag (e.g. by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, \u201cTag Tristan in this photo?\u201d). So when Marc tags me, he\u2019s actually responding to Facebook\u2019s suggestion, not making an independent choice. But through design choices like this, Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line. Facebook uses automatic suggestions like this to get people to tag more people, creating more social externalities and interruptions. The same happens when we change our main profile photo\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook knows that\u2019s a moment when we\u2019re vulnerable to social approval: \u201cwhat do my friends think of my new pic?\u201d Facebook can rank this higher in the news feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we\u2019ll get pulled right back. Everyone innately responds to social approval, but some demographics (teenagers) are more vulnerable to it than others. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this vulnerability. Hijack #5: Social Reciprocity (Tit-for-tat) We are vulnerable to needing to reciprocate others\u2019 gestures. But as with Social Approval, tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it. In some cases, it\u2019s by accident. Email, texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories. But in other cases, companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose. LinkedIn is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations for each other as possible, because each time they reciprocate (by accepting a connection, responding to a message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they have to come back to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time. Like Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn\u2019s list of suggested contacts. In other words, LinkedIn turns your unconscious impulses (to \u201cadd\u201d a person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend doing it. Imagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, reciprocating each other\u200a\u2014\u200aall designed by companies who profit from it. Welcome to social media. After accepting an endorsement, LinkedIn takes advantage of your bias to reciprocate by offering *four* additional people for you to endorse in\u00a0return. Imagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity. Or if there was an independent organization that represented the public\u2019s interests\u200a\u2014\u200aan industry consortium or an FDA for tech\u200a\u2014\u200athat monitored when technology companies abused these biases? Hijack #6: Bottomless bowls, Infinite Feeds, and\u00a0Autoplay YouTube autoplays the next video after a countdown Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things, even when they aren\u2019t hungry anymore. How? Easy. Take an experience that was bounded and finite, and turn it into a bottomless flow that keeps going. Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl that automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people eat 73% more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they ate by 140 calories. Tech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds are purposely designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave. It\u2019s also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or Facebook autoplay the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious choice (in case you won\u2019t). A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing. Facebook autoplays the next video after a countdown Tech companies often claim that \u201cwe\u2019re just making it easier for users to see the video they want to watch\u201d when they are actually serving their business interests. And you can\u2019t blame them, because increasing \u201ctime spent\u201d is the currency they compete for. Instead, imagine if technology companies empowered you to consciously bound your experience to align with what would be \u201ctime well spent\u201d for you. Not just bounding the quantity of time you spend, but the qualities of what would be \u201ctime well spent.\u201d Hijack #7: Instant Interruption vs. \u201cRespectful\u201d Delivery Companies know that messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox). Given the choice, Facebook Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat for that matter) would prefer to design their messaging system to interrupt recipients immediately (and show a chat box) instead of helping users respect each other\u2019s attention. In other words, interruption is good for business. It\u2019s also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity. For example, Facebook automatically tells the sender when you \u201csaw\u201d their message, instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it (\u201cnow that you know I\u2019ve seen the message, I feel even more obligated to respond.\u201d) By contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle \u201cRead Receipts\u201d on or off. The problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary interruptions each day. This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design standards (potentially, as part of Time Well Spent). Hijack #8: Bundling Your Reasons with Their\u00a0Reasons Another way apps hijack you is by taking your reasons for visiting the app (to perform a task) and make them inseparable from the app\u2019s business reasons (maximizing how much we consume once we\u2019re there). For example, in the physical world of grocery stores, the #1 and #2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk. But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy, so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store. In other words, they make the thing customers want (milk, pharmacy) inseparable from what the business wants. If stores were truly organized to support people, they would put the most popular items in the front. Tech companies design their websites the same way. For example, when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the Facebook app doesn\u2019t allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed (their reasons), and that\u2019s on purpose. Facebook wants to convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things. Instead, imagine if\u00a0\u2026 In a Time Well Spent world, there is always a direct way to get what you want separately from what businesses want. Imagine a digital \u201cbill of rights\u201d outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through intentionally placed distractions. Imagine if web browsers empowered you to navigate directly to what you want\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially for sites that intentionally detour you toward their\u00a0reasons. Hijack #9: Inconvenient Choices We\u2019re told that it\u2019s enough for businesses to \u201cmake choices available.\u201d Businesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don\u2019t want you to make harder. Magicians do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don\u2019t. For example, NYTimes.com lets you \u201cmake a free choice\u201d to cancel your digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit \u201cCancel Subscription,\u201d they send you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone number that\u2019s only open at certain times. NYTimes claims it\u2019s giving a free choice to cancel your\u00a0account Instead of viewing the world in terms of availability of choices, we should view the world in terms of friction required to enact choices. Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill (like coefficients of friction) and there was an independent entity\u200a\u2014\u200aan industry consortium or non-profit\u200a\u2014\u200athat labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should be. Hijack #10: Forecasting Errors, \u201cFoot in the Door\u201d strategies Facebook promises an easy choice to \u201cSee Photo.\u201d Would we still click if it gave the true price\u00a0tag? Lastly, apps can exploit people\u2019s inability to forecast the consequences of a click. People don\u2019t intuitively forecast the true cost of a click when it\u2019s presented to them. Sales people use \u201cfoot in the door\u201d techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (\u201cjust one click to see which tweet got retweeted\u201d) and escalate from there (\u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay awhile?\u201d). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick. Imagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through which people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about what benefits and costs it actually had?). That\u2019s why I add \u201cEstimated reading time\u201d to the top of my posts. When you put the \u201ctrue cost\u201d of a choice in front of people, you\u2019re treating your users or audience with dignity and respect. In a Time Well Spent internet, choices could be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to make informed choices by default, not by doing extra work. TripAdvisor uses a \u201cfoot in the door\u201d technique by asking for a single click review (\u201cHow many stars?\u201d) while hiding the three page survey of questions behind the\u00a0click. Summary And How We Can Fix\u00a0This Are you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I\u2019ve listed a few techniques but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole bookshelves, seminars, workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these. Imagine hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked. The ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that\u2019s on our team to help us live, feel, think and act freely. We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our values, not our impulses, first. People\u2019s time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy and other digital rights.
