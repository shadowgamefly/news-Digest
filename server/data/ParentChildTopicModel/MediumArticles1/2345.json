Each time I fumbled in front of a girl, each time I ate alone in the cafeteria, I hated myself a bit more. Why am I so dysfunctional? I asked myself. Later, I decided to fight my shy side. Through self-help books and daily practice, I would \u201creprogram\u201d my personality\u2026 I would become a natural. All that effort payed off. I\u2019m a lot less shy today. But during all that time, I never considered that there could be an advantage to being shy. I only changed my mind after reading David Lipsky\u2019s Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself. In it, Lipsky follows David Foster Wallace on a 5-day book tour for Infinite Jest\u200a\u2014\u200awhich Time magazine considers one of the 100 greatest novels of the last century. Here\u2019s Wallace talking about his shyness: Well, I think being shy basically means being self-absorbed to the extent that it makes it difficult to be around other people. For instance, if I\u2019m hanging out with you, I can\u2019t even tell whether I like you or not, because I\u2019m too worried about whether you like me.

So that there\u2019s a kind of split consciousness that I think makes it difficult to deal with people in the real world. For a writer. But that actually comes in handy. When I read this, something clicked for me. Oh, I thought. I\u2019ve been playing mental chess all my life. Every social struggle I\u2019ve been through has been a mental battlefield\u200a\u2014\u200aa battlefield where I\u2019ve learned how to get inside people\u2019s heads and \u201csee\u201d how they think. Shyness, it seems, has an incredible upside: it teaches us to empathize. Is it really\u00a0shyness? Literary genius or not, David Foster Wallace fought depression all his life. In 2008, his wife came home to find him with a rope around his neck. If suicidal depression is the tradeoff for the benefits of \u201cmental chess,\u201d it is\u200a\u2014\u200ain my mind\u200a\u2014\u200anot worth it. But what if it is not shyness that leads to mental chess but one of its close cousins, introversion? Shyness vs Introversion Contrary to what most people believe, shyness and introversion are not the same thing. In her book Quiet, Susan Cain explains the difference: \u201cShyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Shyness is inherently painful; introversion is not.\u201d Introversion is, as far as we understand, mostly innate. Shyness, on the other hand, is something we acquire\u200a\u2014\u200aput a introvert into the world and there\u2019s a high chance she\u2019ll develop a fear of social humiliation. That\u2019s good news. If shyness is developed, it means that shyness can be overcome. Mommy, I want to be an introvert. Ten years ago, if you had asked me if I wanted to be born again as an extrovert, it would have been an easy yes. Now, it\u2019s an easy no. I\u2019ve realized that introvert have all sorts of advantages\u200a\u2014\u200amany of them related to Wallace\u2019s mental chess. Here\u2019s Sebastian Marshall, author of Gateless (one of my all-time favorite books), on the introvert advantage: \u201cIt seems much easier for introverts to learn how to navigate the social and political worlds than for extroverts to learn how to be alone and reflective without going insane. And being able to be reflective\u200a\u2014\u200ato self-modify, study, analyze, synthesize\u200a\u2014\u200ais probably the master meta-skill for nearly all of thriving at life.\u201d Introverts are naturally better at reflecting. This gives us the ability to learn and affect outcomes. We tend to start out lower (shy in school) but our \u201cceiling\u201d for improvement is also much higher. If you look at high-level performers, says Marshall, you see a lot of introspective types: Introverts pretty consistently run the world. George Washington, of course, was hyper-introverted. Churchill? Introvert. (He drank a hell of a lot when around people.) Hamilton? Introvert. Napoleon? Introvert. Tokugawa? Introvert. That\u2019s before getting into all your favorite inventors, scientists, etc. Introverts, the vast majority of them. I\u2019m not saying introverts are better than extroverts.
