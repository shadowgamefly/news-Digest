Why? Because Facebook was threatened and stole all of their good features and put them into Instagram and now Facebook itself, and so that feature advantage that Snapchat had is simply gone. It\u2019s just the way Facebook plays, right? That\u2019s why they bought Instagram because they Instagram as a threat.
