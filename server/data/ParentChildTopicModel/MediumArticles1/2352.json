Diagnosed with esophageal cancer, the famed Japanese conductor was rushed to the hospital. At 75 years of age, there was no guarantee he would survive. The only choice the doctors had was to cut into Ozawa\u2019s body and remove his esophagus. His stomach was then stretched up to his collarbone and surgically attached to his throat. To this day, he has a scar on his neck from where they sliced him. For an ordinary person, that would be end of a career. But not Seiji Ozawa. In less than a year, despite warnings from doctors, friends and family, Ozawa was back on stage doing what he had done for his whole life\u200a\u2014\u200amaking music. After surgery, the man could barely stand on the best of days. Yet, on stage, he was full of life. Another creative master, the novelist Murakami Haruki, was there to see Ozawa\u2019s performance. Haruki describes Ozawa\u2019s performance in Absolutely on Music: \u201cI was simply awestruck by the fierce intensity with which [Ozawa] threw himself into the work. I could not help worrying about his health, however, and how it would hold up under such a strain.

For Haruki, writing is life. These are two men from different disciplines, but at the core, they are one and the same. In Absolutely on Music, Haruki is constantly making connections between himself and Ozawa: \u201cIn the course of our many conversations, I began to suspect that Seiji Ozawa and I might have several things in common. Questions of talent or productivity or fame aside, what I mean here is that I can feel a sense of identity in the way we live our lives.\u201d What does Haruki mean by this way of life? How do Haruki and Ozawa differ from ordinary people? Haruki points out three similarities between Ozawa and himself. 1. Intrinsic Reward The first similarity Haruki is their perspective on work. \u201cFirst of all, both of us seem to take the same simple joy in our work. Whatever differences there might be between making music and writing fiction, both of us are happiest when absorbed in our work. And the very fact that we are able to become so totally engrossed in it gives us the deepest satisfaction. What we end up producing as a result of that work may well be important, but aside from that, our ability to work with utter concentration and to devote ourselves to it so completely that we forget the passage of time is its own irreplaceable reward.\u201d It is not just the book or product or musical masterpiece that drives them, it is the intrinsic reward. But there\u2019s something else to the above passage. Let\u2019s take a look that phrase at the end again: \u201c\u2026our ability to work with utter concentration and to devote ourselves to it so completely that we forget the passage of time\u2026\u201d Now compare with this excerpt from Steven Kotler\u2019s The Rise of Superman about the psychological state called flow: \u201cIn flow, we are so focused on the task at hand that everything else falls away. Action and awareness merge. Time flies. Self vanishes. Performance goes through the roof.\u201d The flow state\u200a\u2014\u200aalso known as \u201cthe zone\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ais the state of being completely absorbed in what you do. It feels really, really good. Another excerpt from Kotler\u2019s book: \u201cDuring a peak experience,\u201d Maslow explained, \u2018the individual experiences an expansion of self, a sense of unity, and meaningfulness in life. The experience lingers in one\u2019s consciousness and gives a sense of purpose, integration, self-determination and empathy.\u2019 \u201d Perhaps this is what Haruki and Ozawa experience when they are deeply absorbed in their work? For more clues, let\u2019s look at the next similarity. 2. Stay\u00a0Hungry Closely related to Ozawa and Haruki\u2019s love of their work is their constant search for a challenge: Secondly, we both maintain the same \u201chungry heart\u201d we possessed in our youth, that persistent feeling that \u201cthis is not good enough,\u201d that we must dig deeper, forge farther ahead. This is the major motif of our work and our lives. Observing Ozawa in action, I could feel the depth and intensity of the desire he brought to his work. He was convinced of his own rightness and proud of what he was doing, but not in the least satisfied with it. I could see he knew he should be able to make the music even better, even deeper, and he was determined to make it happen even as he struggled with the constraints of time and his own physical strength. Even when Ozawa earns the respect of everyone around him, even when he has enough money in his bank account to live for 200 years, he does stop challenging himself. He cannot stop challenging himself. Could this mindset be related to the flow state too? Let\u2019s look at a passage from a seminal book on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s Flow: \u201c\u2026the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person\u2019s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\u201d Aha. To enter the flow state, we need to be challenged. And in order to be challenged, we must never be satisfied\u2026 Now, on to the third similarity. 3. Stubborn Independence The third of our shared traits is stubbornness. We\u2019re patient, tough, and, finally, just plain stubborn. Once we\u2019ve decided to do something in a certain way, it doesn\u2019t matter what anybody else says, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do it. And even if, as a result, we find ourselves in dire straits, possibly even hated, we will take responsibility for our actions without making excuses. Hmm. Does stubbornness have anything to do with the flow state? To enter flow, activities must be done for their own, intrinsic reward. Think about a child building her sandcastle at the beach. She\u2019s not doing it for money or fame; she\u2019s doing it for fun. The flow state and play are close cousins. Sadly, society doesn\u2019t want its adults playing around. Here\u2019s Kotler again in The Rise of Superman: \u2026we have decided that play\u200a\u2014\u200aan activity fundamental to survival, tied to the greatest neurochemical rewards the brain can produce, and flat out necessary for achieving peak performance, creative brilliance, and overall life satisfaction\u200a\u2014\u200ais a waste of time for adults. If we are hunting the highest version of ourselves, then we need to turn work into play and not the other way round. When you have an idea that nobody has thought of before, family and friends are going to doubt you. They might tell you to \u201cgrow up\u201d or \u201cbe realistic.\u201d If you aren\u2019t stubborn, you might even listen to them. So there you have it. Three traits that Murakami Haruki shares with Seiji Ozawa. But maybe it\u2019s not three traits. Perhaps it\u2019s just one trait that the two of them share\u200a\u2014\u200aa deep, irresistible love for the experience of flow. They only look crazy to us. Want more?
