Gaining insights and feedback is important, but how do you then convey your plan back to the users? Public roadmapping for a product can be a transparent way to respond to users and communicate realistic plans for your\u00a0product. Last year at Front we decided to make our product roadmap public. Everyone can see which features we\u2019ve been working on, where they are in development, as well as future ideas. Everyone can vote for the features they want to see implemented in Front. Our roadmap is built entirely with\u00a0Trello. Trello already had all the capabilities we needed to strike the correct balance between transparency and control: cards are visible by everyone and everyone has the ability to vote on them, but only members of the team can push new idea cards. Should you want to build your own, here are the detailed instructions. When we launched this public roadmap, we didn\u2019t think much of it. A year later, we can give a definitive answer: the public roadmap is a huge success! Here\u2019s why, despite some misconceptions, your company may benefit from a public roadmap too. Dispelling The Competitor Myth Some people think we are crazy to launch a public roadmap. Their main concern is that our plans are visible to our competitors, thus making it easy for the other guys to see what we are up to and beat us at our own game. We disagree; instead we are taking a page out of Elon Musk\u2019s book.

They knew the difficult, yet valuable aspect was not the idea of reusable rocket stages, but to actually implement it in the real world. Of course, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re doing rocket science here, but we also don\u2019t plan on winning with ideas alone: we know execution is everything. If we can\u2019t beat our competition on execution, we can\u2019t\u00a0win. Why Transparency Builds A Community Building a community of users around a B2B product is not easy. There are not a lot of people sharing a pre-existing passion for customer support, or email clients, so we didn\u2019t expect our users to spontaneously start talking about Front. To encourage them to open up and discuss what we were making, we had to meet them halfway and give them things to talk about. The public roadmap is a huge part of this effort.
