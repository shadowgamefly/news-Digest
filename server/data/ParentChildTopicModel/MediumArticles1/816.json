I spend most of my nights and mornings thinking about my present problems and my future obstacles. When I need to feel grounded, I read The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. It smacks reality and truth across my face each time I read it. Reading it creates a cathartic experience every time. While I\u2019m reading it, my problems seem trivial, I\u2019m brought back to earth, and I feel refreshed. The book requires re reading, because the lessons in it take an entire lifetime to practice and master. I\u2019m going to share some of the lessons from the book today to help bring you back to earth and put your problems into proper perspective. Again, these lessons are simple and profound, yet difficult to follow. Take time to think about these lessons and try to move forward according to them. And buy the book. It\u2019s one you can revisit on a daily basis if need be. \u201cHow much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.\u201d How much of our lives are robbed by focusing on other people? We almost seem to enjoy and revel in it, even though it\u2019s both a waste of time and causes nothing positive to happen in our lives. What does it accomplish? Have you ever\u200a\u2014\u200aeven once\u200a\u2014\u200agained anything of value whatsoever by prioritizing someone else\u2019s actions over your own? Can you change someone else\u2019s thoughts, philosophy, and speech? Even if you can, is it worth the time you could\u2019ve spent living your own life? I see people sling mud at one another on the internet\u200a\u2014\u200awith so much energy\u200a\u2014\u200awhy? It never leads to anything good. Both sides are worse off and nothing gets resolved. We forget how fleeting life is and the fact we\u2019ll all be dead sooner than we think. How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it. This reminds me of the quote \u201cbeing bitter is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.\u201d It seems like we all have a masochistic relationship with anger. Again, why? This person has done something harmful to me. Ok. But it\u2019s done. How does my being angry change what happened? It doesn\u2019t. Why can\u2019t I just let it go? \u201cBecause they should pay for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Imagine a situation where they do pay for what they\u2019ve done. Do you think it will give you peace? Is it worth is if it comes at the expense of your own character? \u201cBecause they should feel bad for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Why? Because you said so? As difficult as it is, we need to realize people live according to their own scripts. We can either accept them as they are or try to change them.
