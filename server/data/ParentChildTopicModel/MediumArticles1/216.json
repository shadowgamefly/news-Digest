That took me a long time to understand. Granted, I\u2019m a stubborn idiot who has to learn things the hard way. But one thing I\u2019ve learned about the workplace is this: Things are not what they seem. Here are five cold hard truths about the workplace. Understanding them will help improve your professional life. 1. Co-Workers Are Not Your\u00a0Friends You\u2019re supposed to be best friends with your co-workers. At least, that\u2019s what people who call the shots at organizations want you to believe. But don\u2019t be fooled by all the phoniness. It all starts with the recruitment process. Recruiters, HR folks, hiring managers, they all try to convince you that they have an open culture. That they value teamwork. And honesty. It\u2019s all BS. All organizations are the same. Why?

That they will sacrifice a paycheck for your friendship? Not going to happen. Just be mindful of that and do your job. Stay professional. And have a good time with people at work. See them as professional relationships. Nothing more. Nothing less. 2. Perception Is\u00a0Reality This one is my least favorite truth and the one that I never got used to. And probably never will. That\u2019s my flaw. Look, you can pretend it\u2019s not about appearances at work, but it is. Looking busy and actually being busy are the same thing. Why? Because perception equals reality. If you\u2019re perceived as the office clown, you are one. No matter how hard you work. If you\u2019re perceived as a naysayer who always goes home at 5 pm, you are one. And no one will offer you any opportunities. Now, all this doesn\u2019t mean you should ONLY be about appearances. Of course not. The reality is much more subtle. It\u2019s about understanding that you have to be \u2018visibile\u2019, as people at corporations love to call it, and professional. 3.

You can\u2019t change others. But you can change yourself. 4. Couples Are\u00a0Targets Research shows that the more you see someone, the more attractive they become. That\u2019s why you\u2019re suddenly attracted to that co-worker you didn\u2019t notice before. And on one TGIF drinks, you start talking, some light touching happens, and boom: A spark.
