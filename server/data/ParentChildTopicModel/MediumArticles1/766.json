Mimicking real life, users wanted the ability to react differently to different posts. Hence, Facebook Reactions! Customer-orientation > product-orientation One of the fathers of modern marketing and renowned Harvard professor, Theodore Levitt, argued way back in 1960, that \u201cbusinesses should stop defining themselves by what they produced and instead define themselves by customer needs, desires and problems.\u201d In his now classic paper \u2018Marketing Myopia\u2019, he argued how the railroads in the US served as an example of an industry whose failure to grow was due to a limited market view. Those behind the railroads were in trouble not because the need for passenger transportation had declined. Rather, the industry failed because those behind it assumed they were in the railroad business rather than the customer transportation business. They failed because they were product-oriented instead of being customer-oriented. A company isn\u2019t a product-creating and product-enhancing establishment, but rather a customer-creating and customer-retaining establishment. Similarly, Nokia, once the undisputed leader in the mobile phone business, ultimately died as a phone company not because the demand for mobile phones as a product went down but because they didn\u2019t understand the needs of their customers as well as their competitors did. Forget features and product enhancements, understand customer needs and pain-points: HBS professor and disruptive innovation expert Clay Christensen shares the story of a fast-food restaurant chain that wanted to improve its milkshake sales. The company did what any self-respecting product company would do: Build better features in terms of what it saw as the ideal product. In this case, they made the milkshakes even yummier after inquiring about their customer demographics\u2019 taste buds. But alas, milkshake sales did not improve. The company then enlisted the help of one of Christensen\u2019s fellow researchers, who approached the situation by trying to deduce the \u201cjob\u201d that customers were \u201chiring\u201d a milkshake to do; the \u2018pain-point\u2019 users were seeking to solve by buying the milkshake.

Netflix founder and CEO, Reed Hastings, famously told his product team how Netflix wasn\u2019t actually competing against other streaming services, but with work, wine, outdoor sports and other solutions people tried, to pass a boring evening at home. This kind of thinking outside of your own product and from the customer\u2019s point of view is what separates great product leaders from the merely good; and it is little wonder then that, with such customer orientation, Netflix is one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Great PMs vs Good\u00a0PMs: The only companies who succeed over the long-term will be those who define themselves based on their customers\u2019 needs and desires and not those who bank on the presumed longevity of their products. Usually, PMs can become so focused on continually shipping features on time and delivering the next great product, that they may neglect to take the time to speak to actual users and fully understand the implications of their last product launch. The thing is that the real difference between a good and a great Product manager may take years to reflect in terms of impact on the market. It\u2019s easy to be a good PM in the shorter term by shipping a number of features and enhancements than a great PM who takes time off to figure out \u2018what to build\u2019 that actually solves the real user problem before rushing to build it.
