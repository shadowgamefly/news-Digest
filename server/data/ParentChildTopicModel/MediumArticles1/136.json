I travel with my husband when I can,\u201d she told Julia Ioffe of GQ last year. She\u2019s maintaining that facade even now, as she stays in New York with Barron while Trump\u2019s presidency gets underway. She is the only first lady since Abigail Adams in 1797 who chose not to immediately move into the White House, according to Anderson Brower. Some see this as a subversive declaration of independence, or a sign that her marriage is not as happy as they might claim. But it could just be her way of signaling that she\u2019s truly not starstruck by anything, even the office of the presidency. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see whether Melania continues to play by her own rules, or whether she grows into the more traditional aspects of the FLOTUS. She\u2019s already starting to become a bit more of a D.C. presence\u200a\u2014\u200aon Wednesday, as her husband works to dismantle the nation\u2019s health care system, Melania visited the Children\u2019s Hospital and issued a statement extolling the virtues of \u201cnature\u2019s elements into our daily lives.\u201d One thing is for sure\u200a\u2014\u200ashe\u2019s not a cartoon figure of a victim or a vixen. And projecting these assumptions onto her not only keeps us from recognizing her for the fully formed human being that she is, but also prevents us from holding her fully responsible for her words and actions. She\u2019s not the unconventional first lady many of us hoped for, but she\u2019s the one we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s time to hold her accountable for that.
