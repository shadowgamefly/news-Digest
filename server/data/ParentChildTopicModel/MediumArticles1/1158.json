In 2015, they added four features\u2026. Search for\u00a0Photos Using the Service Using Flickr is relatively easy and intuitive. First time users are asked to sign up and make an account. At first, because of Yahoo\u2019s decline, I was afraid users would have to have (or be forced to make) a Yahoo account, but users are allowed to use another e-mail address. In the future, Flickr might consider allowing users to sign-up with one of their social media accounts to streamline the sign-up process.

They are typically organized by the date taken, as well as the album or photos they are grouped in. Users, however, can change this based on their needs. Searching for photos is simple too.

Cherry Blossom\u00a0Search If that search wasn\u2019t enough, users can perform an advanced search using color filters, gradients, and other tools.
