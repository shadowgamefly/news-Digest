We\u2019re coworkers in some ways, but in other ways we\u2019re not. It\u2019s like a competitiveness that brings out cattiness sometimes. But that also forms a bond. The Jeff-and-Les thing is the perfect example. Jeff and Les, even after they got in that fight, I\u2019m around them every single day. They talk. They joke. When something happens in a big moment, we all sort of talk about what it means. Even though Jeff and Les literally hit each other, they stand up for each other.

Eject Jimmy.\u201d They really enjoyed it. Cataldi: We absolutely hate each other when we\u2019re competing. And then we immediately team up when necessity arises like this. What I do now, and the bully pulpit that I have now, there\u2019s never a time when I\u2019m not screaming at GMs who feel they don\u2019t need to make themselves available in a crisis with their team, like Bryan Colangelo, who\u2019s become invisible the last six months. I feel like I have this forum, and it\u2019s my responsibility to speak on behalf of all the media in the area and say this isn\u2019t the way you do it in Philadelphia. So, yeah, in that regard we\u2019re all on the team. But over the years, yeah, the team has its issues internally. Ford: Philly media is a really, really big, loud Thanksgiving table where, essentially, everyone is competing for the good drumstick. Everyone wants the good story. Everyone wants to be better than the other guy. But then we all go out to dinner. When we\u2019re on the road, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to have 12, 14 guys going out to dinner together. And being loud, by the way. McLane: The dynamic of what happens with our media is interesting. [Eagles director of public relations] Derek Boyko always says he\u2019d have a reality show about the inner workings and personalities on the beat. It\u2019s a weird crew. There are some guys who shall remain nameless, I don\u2019t know how they exist, but they exist. Hayes: The reality of any media group, but especially the closed group of media that\u2019s covered the same team for a long time, the reality is you form relationships with those people\u00a0\u2026 but, I mean, there\u2019s conflict at times. Kempski: If someone writes something dumb, pretty good chance that will get made fun of by us privately. And publicly. Hayes: The irony that Jeff\u2019s greatest champion in this is Les Bowen is palpable. In September 2011, a heated Twitter exchange between Bowen and McLane led to a physical confrontation at the Eagles practice facility. Parks: Twitter is the worst. Ford: It\u2019s hard to do nuance in 140 characters. And then you have two quirky, competing senses of humor in Jeff and Les. And it\u2019s all wrapped up in id. Id. We\u2019ve all got a lot of id. They competed hard and got into a fistfight in the work room at the NovaCare Complex. Parks: I was late that day. I was so pissed I missed it. I literally still think about it. Everyone talks about it, and I\u2019m still kicking myself for being late. Ford: The fight didn\u2019t surprise me. What happened [Sunday in the press box] surprised me\u200a\u2014\u200athat Jeff was ejected. But it didn\u2019t surprise me that Les supported him and backed him up. We all might be biting at each other, but were all in the same foxhole. Their thing has been over for years. There\u2019s a lot of history with us. McLane: Les and I, we had one little incident that got blown out of proportion. Honestly, that would have been another thing that never would have reached the light of day and would have been handled in house if bigmouth Howard Eskin didn\u2019t blab it on radio. Howard Eskin (longtime Philly sports radio/TV host, antagonist, Santa impersonator): I still think it\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s hilarious that it got to that point. Those guys still work together. It was hilarious. It was for the twitidiots and the Twitter world. It\u2019s nothing personal. Listen, I don\u2019t want to start any more fights with people. I can do that on my own. I don\u2019t need you to help me. This is true. He once threatened me in the Eagles locker room and it still makes me smile. Bowen: I\u2019m still not sure how much I\u2019m supposed to discuss what happened five years ago. That was a very tricky thing. We both worked for the same company and there was discipline involved and so forth. I will say that Jeff and I\u00a0\u2026 there was a time when we were very bitter and fierce rivals. That\u2019s much less true now. We know each other much better than we did years ago. We\u2019ve been around each other a lot more. We\u2019ve shared a lot of things. We\u2019re players, and they\u2019re the other team. You don\u2019t think that in a day-in and day-out basis. But it\u2019s very clear who\u2019s on which team. McLane: We\u2019re on the journalism team. Ford: Of course the locker room learned about [the fight] almost immediately. Players are fabulous gossips. They love all that kind of stuff. There was a media scrum around Michael Vick that day. And around the perimeter of the scrum was Asante Samuel. And he\u2019s going: \u201cJeeffffff. Leeeesssss. I know you\u2019re in there. Jeeffffff. Leesssss. Come out. I need to talk to yoooouuuu.\u201d The players couldn\u2019t get enough of it. They love that kind of stuff. That\u2019s what I remember most\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much delight Asante took in it. Kempski: It got to the point where Asante was being so intrusive that Vick just stopped talking and started laughing. Parks: I shot that video. I wasn\u2019t full time on the beat yet. I was trying to work my way up. I kept recording and I was like, \u201cOh shit, I think I have something.\u201d It was the first time that national people picked up my stuff and retweeted it. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with writing skill or talent. Maybe there\u2019s no ESP without Jeff or Les. It became such a big deal locally and nationally that it got made into a bizarre and hilarious Taiwanese computer animation. Kempski: That\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve made it. You\u2019ve done something special when there\u2019s Taiwanese computer animation of you. Bowen: I was embarrassed and wish people would drop it. Five years later people still haven\u2019t dropped it. Cataldi: Many of the guys we\u2019ve had in our press corps have been eccentrics. When you put them all in the same room, sometimes things get heated. You may as well sell popcorn. Parks: I wouldn\u2019t say me and Jeff are close. The beat is so competitive. We\u2019re coworkers in some ways, but in other ways we\u2019re not. It\u2019s like a competitiveness that brings out cattiness sometimes. But that also forms a bond. The Jeff-and-Les thing is the perfect example. Jeff and Les, even after they got in that fight, I\u2019m around them every single day. They talk. They joke. When something happens in a big moment, we all sort of talk about what it means. Even though Jeff and Les literally hit each other, they stand up for each other. I think there\u2019s a mutual respect there. Hayes: The fraternity we\u2019re talking about is something we take seriously. Ford: It\u2019s that thing about \u201cI can yell at my brother. I can even punch my brother. But you can\u2019t.\u201d Bowen: A year ago, I was at the viewing for Jeff\u2019s mom when the Eagles fired Chip Kelly. We don\u2019t hang out together. For one thing, he\u2019s 20 years younger than I am. But we all have dinner together on the road. We\u2019re cordial. I respect what he does, and I think he respects what I do. McLane: I have tremendous respect for Les. We\u2019re friends. Bowen: We\u2019re in a much different situation than we were years ago. It\u2019s not nearly as bitter or contentious between the papers. There used to be a lot of sniping back and forth. That doesn\u2019t occur anymore now that we\u2019re all in the same newsroom. That\u2019s discouraged now quite strongly. Cataldi: These are some really colorful people, funny to be around, really entertaining\u200a\u2014\u200aand they\u2019ll slit your throat if you look away for a second. I like it.
