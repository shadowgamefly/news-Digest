Bill Simmons makes his Most Valuable Player pick. It\u2019s historic. On Sunday afternoon, I was watching my daughter play soccer in Parts Unknown, California, right as Sergio Garcia was stealing the Masters from Justin Rose. The Masters app kept freezing on me, so I settled on clandestinely following the last few holes on Twitter. Out of nowhere, Russell Westbrook hijacked my feed\u200a\u2014\u200afirst by breaking Oscar\u2019s triple-double record, then by beating Denver on a 30-foot buzzer-beater to finish with a stupefying 50\u201316\u201310. And yeah, it\u2019s the Year of Stupefying Box Scores. But this one felt extra special: Westbrook had spent the previous two weeks on something of an MVP vigilante tour, one that was missing only a remember-it-10-years-from-now \u201cHOLY SHIT!!!!!!\u201d moment. Fans reacted accordingly, and in real time: exclamation points, all caps, weird GIFs and everything else that keeps Twitter indispensable. Within three minutes, I watched video of Westbrook burying that crazy heave, then being mobbed by teammates in a sports-movie ending that had everything but Explosions in the Sky. A little bit later, an awesome picture surfaced of Westbrook celebrating the shot\u200a\u2014\u200aflying through the air, body clenched, fuck-you face in full effect\u200a\u2014\u200aflanked by the faces of Nuggets fans reacting like their cars were getting towed. With that, Westbrook\u2019s MVP r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was complete: He pulled the first Oscar since Oscar, averaged a 32\u201311\u201310 for an entire season (it still seems like a typo), pulled at least 12 victories out of the deep recesses of the Thunder\u2019s sphincter, saved Oklahoma City from its post-Durant hangover, seduced a normally crusty NBA internet culture, generated a remarkable amount of respect from his peers, and generally wore down even his most passionate haters. I believe that Russell Westbrook will win the 2017 MVP trophy. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right pick. (Getty Images) Twenty years ago, Jackie MacMullan swung the MVP vote from Michael Jordan by writing one \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if the Mailman finally won?\u201d column for Sports Illustrated. In 2017, most media members agonize over their votes. Transparency helps\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t vote Westbrook or Harden fifth just to be a dick, and you can\u2019t toss a fourth-place vote to your hometown star without everyone knowing. We also have better metrics, better access to games, better in-the-moment enjoyment tools, better everything. We breathe the league every single day. It\u2019s a never-ending onslaught of information, opinion, dialogue, highlights and games. That constant noise spawns more peaks and valleys, more going-against-the-grain hot takes, more waffling, more getting-ahead-of-ourselves moments and waaaaaaaaaaay more hyperbole. (We\u2019re on a historic pace in 2017 of people using the word \u201chistoric.\u201d) For me, 2017 stands out as our first MVP Race On Demand. I wasn\u2019t going to watch the Thunder tonight, but Westbrook has a 32\u201310\u201312 going through three quarters? I\u2019m in! That made Westbrook-Harden-Kawhi-LeBron seem greater than it was. In reality, Stephen Curry\u2019s 2016 r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u200a\u2014\u200a30\u20137\u20135, 50\u201345\u201391%, 5.1 made 3s, 31.5 PER, and oh yeah, SEVENTY-THREE WINS\u200a\u2014\u200atrumps any 2017 MVP candidate. You know what made this year\u2019s battle so delightful? The flaws. LeBron\u2019s Cavs limped to a 23\u201323 record in their last 46 games; that dude hasn\u2019t played for a 30-loss team in nine years. Kawhi would be remembered as our least impactful offensive MVP since Wes Unseld. Westbrook, by every conceivable metric, has been the biggest ball hog in NBA history; he\u2019d also become the first MVP with fewer than 50 wins since 1982, when half the league was downing cocaine like it was vitamin B. Harden offers almost-as-big numbers as Westbrook and an undeniable ability to make teammates better\u00a0\u2026 and yet, Houston won only eight more games than OKC. Can we call it the most entertaining MVP race ever? For sheer greatness, I would stick the following four ahead of it. (Getty Images) 1987: Reigning three-time MVP Larry Bird submits his greatest start-to-finish season, throwing up a 28\u20138\u20139, creating the 50\u201340\u201390 Club (53\u201340\u201391% that year), setting the assists record for forwards and maintaining his Trash Talking/Basketball Jesus/Highlight Passing/Buzzer-Beating ceiling. He finishes\u00a0\u2026 third! MJ grabs the torch as the league\u2019s Next Great Superstar, breaks the non-Wilt record for points (37.1 PPG) and becomes the second player ever (still) to score more than 3,000 points in one season. He finishes\u00a0\u2026 second! And Magic gently grabs the car keys from Kareem for a career year: 24\u201312\u20136, 65 wins, at least 2,927 thrilling plays and his first (deserved) MVP trophy. Signature seasons from two of the six best players ever coupled with a breakout season for the GOAT? Yeah, we\u2019re not topping that one. 1962: A frenetic pace juiced everyone\u2019s numbers in the early \u201960s, turning it into the NBA\u2019s benevolent version of baseball\u2019s Steroid Era (complete with beers and Marlboro Reds). Two-time MVP Bob Pettit averaged a 31\u201319 and finished sixth. Jerry West tossed up a 31\u20138\u20135 and finished fifth. Elgin Baylor played only 48 games thanks to military obligations; poor Elgin lived in an Army barracks in Washington, flying out whenever he could (usually weekends) in coach on planes that connected multiple times, and somehow averaged a 38\u201319\u20135 BECAUSE ELGIN BAYLOR WAS APPARENTLY SUPERHUMAN. He finished fourth. Oscar dropped his triple-double season and won MVP bronze. Wilt averaged 50 and 26, scored more than 4,000 points, dropped 100 on the Knicks\u00a0\u2026 and finished second. And Russell was Russell: the best player on the best team, the greatest winner of all time. (He also averaged a 19\u201324 and probably blocked 230 shots a game.) Did you know the players voted back then? They gave Russell 51 of their 85 first-place votes; it\u2019s a wonderful example of how they felt about Russell and Wilt. In my NBA book, I ranked Russell second, Wilt sixth, West ninth, Oscar 10th, Elgin 15th, and Pettit 17th. Wake me when we get another MVP race with (a) six of the best 20 players ever, (b) the runners-up averaging a triple-double or 50 points a game, and (c) someone moonlighting as a part-time NBA star who never practices and still averages 38.3 points per game. 1993: After Phoenix stole Charles Barkley from the hapless Sixers, the Chuckster won our hearts on the \u201992 Dream Team, then averaged a 26\u201312\u20135 on a charming 62-win Suns team. (If small-ball NBA offenses were video game systems, the \u201993 Suns were Nintendo, Nash\u2019s Suns were PlayStation, and Curry\u2019s Warriors were Xbox One). The mainstream media had turned on an increasingly salty MJ (two straight MVPs, two straight rings, and six straight killer seasons, so his 33\u20137\u20136, 57 wins and first-team All-Defense somehow felt mundane), and they definitely weren\u2019t excited about Hakeem\u2019s outrageous Rockets season (26\u201313\u20134, 53% FG, 150 steals, 342 blocks, 55 wins, the best two-way center since Kareem) or Patrick Ewing anchoring Riley\u2019s almost-champ Bully Ball Knicks (24\u201312, 60 wins, lots of sneering). It was more FUN to vote for Barkley. And look, there are hundreds of reasons to complain about the internet these days. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Just know that the internet never, in a million bazillion katrillion years, would have allowed Michael Jordan to lose the \u201993 and \u201997 MVPs. He should have won seven, not five. But that \u201993 race headlined a spectacular year for talent: the MJ-Barkley-Hakeem generation hitting its peak right as the Shaq-Kemp-Payton generation was spreading its wings. And seven fewer teams! 2017 reminds me of 1993 in that respect; if the 2017 playoffs can be 90 percent as good as the 1993 playoffs, everyone is going to lose their fucking minds. 1990: Magic\u2019s shakiest MVP season: 22\u201312\u20137 and 63 wins, only he couldn\u2019t have defended Kevin Hart at that point. Barkley (25\u201312\u20134, 60% FG, 53 wins) garnered more first-place votes than Magic while playing for a mediocre Sixers team; he may have bested Magic if we\u2019d have known about Barkley\u2019s 66.1 true shooting percentage (????), 17.3 win shares, 27.1 PER, and 128 offensive rating. And MJ averaged a 33\u20137\u20136, dominated every advanced metric that we never knew about, and played his usual world-class defense on a 55-win Bulls team\u00a0\u2026 only the idiotic \u201cMichael doesn\u2019t know how to make his teammates better\u201d mainstream media backlash had blossomed into full-fledged ignorance. (Thank God Skip Bayless didn\u2019t have a show back then.) Magic ran the league; Jordan hadn\u2019t EARNED IT yet. Or something. (You know what? Jordan should have won eight MVPs. My bad, MJ. I counted wrong.) But here\u2019s where 1990 goes to another level. Mailman (31\u201311, 56% FG, 55 wins) and Ewing (29\u201311, 4 BPG, 45 wins) had their best offensive seasons ever\u200a\u2014\u200arepeat: EVER\u200a\u2014\u200aand couldn\u2019t crack the top three. Rookie David Robinson tossed up a 24\u201312 with 4 blocks and dragged the Spurs from 21 wins to 56\u00a0\u2026 all of which was good enough for sixth place. And Hakeem eked 41 wins out of a lousy Rockets team by doing this: 24\u201314, 50% FG, 2.1 steals, 4.6 blocks. I like a stat called \u201cstocks\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s just blocks plus steals. Hakeem had 550 stocks that season. HE FINISHED SEVENTH. Vintage seasons from two of the best five players ever, three of the four best post-Kareem centers (including Hakeem, who\u2019s a top-12 all-time guy) and two of the greatest power forwards ever? Yeeesh. Here\u2019s the good news: 2017\u2019s talent pool definitely mirrors that 1990\u201393 stretch. Check out my four All-NBA teams\u00a0\u2026 and keep in mind that I can vote for only three. All-NBA Fourth\u00a0Team Karl-Anthony TownsPaul GeorgeJimmy ButlerChris PaulDamian Lillard Notes: We\u2019re so deep that Marc Gasol, Hassan Whiteside, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Boogie Cousins and Klay Thompson couldn\u2019t make my FOURTH team. Anyway, I couldn\u2019t reward George and Butler with third-team spots for being the best players on fringe playoff teams. Chris Paul didn\u2019t play enough games to steal a John Wall/DeMar DeRozan spot; the good news is that he\u2019s officially grumpier than Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. After the All-Star break, Towns averaged a 28\u201313 with inconceivable 60\u201343\u201384% splits\u200a\u2014\u200aonly a 50-loss season ruined his candidacy. And poor Dame Lillard\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say. I really don\u2019t. After his All-Star snubbing, he averaged a 30\u20136\u20135 and dragged the Blazers into the playoffs\u00a0\u2026 and I don\u2019t have room for him. I feel terrible. Please don\u2019t write a dis track about me, Dame. The Nuggets Have Finally Identified Their CornerstoneAfter a rough start, Denver has unleashed Nikola Jokic and is suddenly looking like one of the most exciting teams in\u2026theringer.com All-NBA Third\u00a0Team Nikola JokicDraymond GreenGordon HaywardJohn WallDeMar DeRozan Notes: We can\u2019t penalize Jokic because his dopey coach needed two solid months to realize that he had the next Walton/Sabonis on his team. Since Christmas, Jokic has been 20\u201311\u20136 every night. Come on, Mike Malone. That\u2019s like not realizing you were sitting on Netflix stock. As for Draymond, he\u2019s been the night-to-night engine for the league\u2019s superior team, as well as the most malleable elite defender since Dennis Rodman. When KD injured his knee, Green held down the fort as Golden State\u2019s only rim protector. If Dray shot the ball better, and if his Uninterrupted videos were better, I would have flipped him with KD. I still fuck with Dray. (Sorry, I had to.) I don\u2019t even hold it against him that, if he had never nailed LeBron in the balls, Durant would be on the Celtics right now. Fine, that\u2019s not true. DeRozan proved that 2-guards could still score 27 a night on 18-footers, violent drives and free throws; you could easily imagine him playing with Frazier and DeBusschere 35 years ago. Wall\u2019s breathtaking speed and athleticism would turn him into an internet legend if Westbrook didn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s amazing that he hasn\u2019t hired Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly to take Westbrook out. And Hayward was the steadying offensive force on a sneaky-dangerous Jazz team\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if it feels weird naming someone with that beard-hair combo as one of the NBA\u2019s best 15 players, there was no way around it. More important, he easily won 2017\u2019s Mokeski Award as the league\u2019s best white player. His first Mokeski! What a moment! Enjoy the trophy, Gordon. See you in Boston in October. All-NBA Second\u00a0Team Anthony DavisGiannis AntetokounmpoKevin DurantStephen CurryIsaiah Thomas Notes: This summer, we\u2019re sending a SWAT team to New Orleans to get AD out of there. It\u2019s time. I\u2019m thinking mid-July, when nobody is paying attention. We can\u2019t allow him to turn into this generation\u2019s KG. Meanwhile, Thomas single-handedly won about 20 Celtics games, carried their nightly scoring burden (and then some), helped steal a 1-seed and quietly tossed up the greatest advanced metrics season by a 6-foot-and-under guy. (Throwing up a 29\u20136 every night with 3.2 3-pointers and 46/38/91% splits while playing just 34 minutes a game? And smarter defenses basically doubling you as soon as you crossed midcourt? I\u2019m still processing that one.) Isaiah Thomas: \u201cI Feel Like I\u2019m the Best Player in the World\u201dThe Celtics guard discusses what it takes to be one of the greatstheringer.com As for my podcast pal Durant, he gooses the MVP race to another level if Zaza never cut-blocks him like Richie Incognito. Even with KD missing 21 games, the Warriors finished 67\u201315 with one of the five highest point differentials ever. Let\u2019s say KD avoids Zaza, bumps them to 70 wins and finishes 27\u20139\u20136 with 50/40/90%, underrated rim protection, and the highest night-to-night efficiency of anyone. Would he have supplanted Kawhi as the \u201cbest guy on the best team\u201d choice? (I say yes.) Give me 61 KD games over 72 to 82 games of any forward not named LeBron, Kawhi or Giannis. His teammate Curry snares my no. 5 MVP spot for (a) being the most reliable star on the league\u2019s best-by-far team; (b) having one of the better quote-unquote \u201coff years\u201d: 25\u20137\u20135, 47\u201341\u201390%, 324 threes (second highest ever); and (c) his usual terrorizing of defenders who spend Warriors games yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t lose him! Where is he? SWITCH!\u201d And by the way, shout-out to Curry for leading the way on this: 2015\u201317 Warriors: 207\u2013391996\u201398 Bulls: 203\u2013431984\u201386 Celtics: 192\u2013541985\u201387 Lakers: 189\u201357 That\u2019s insane. As for Giannis, the Freak\u2019s breakout season\u200a\u2014\u200a23\u20135\u20139, 52% FG and a 6-seed for the injury-ravaged Bucks\u200a\u2014\u200aeasily earned him Unicorn of the Year honors despite Jokic\u2019s late charge. Sadly, the NBA\u2019s digital ballot rejected Giannis as my first-team center, even if the Freak could have fake-protected the fake rim on our fake team. (Could we have handled our fake business on both fake ends with the Freak, Kawhi, LeBron, Russ and the Beard? Please.) I settled on\u00a0\u2026 Rudy Gobert, my runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year, an offensive/defensive ratings god, an occasionally dominant force for the 50-win Jazz, the second-best French player ever, and a lifelong cautionary tale for anyone thinking about trading backward in the NBA draft just for cash. Speaking of that first team\u00a0\u2026 All-NBA First\u00a0Team Rudy GobertLeBron JamesKawhi LeonardRussell WestbrookJames Harden It\u2019s MVP time.

Question 1: If you replaced each MVP candidate with a decent player at his position for the entire season, what would be the hypothetical effect on his team\u2019s\u00a0record? We\u2019re using Marcus Morris and Jordan Clarkson as our \u201cdecent\u201d replacements\u200a\u2014\u200aMorris for Kawhi and LeBron, Clarkson for Westbrook and Harden. No offense, Marcus. Seriously, I don\u2019t want the Morris brothers mad at me. (Thinking.) Actually, we\u2019re going to use Kent Bazemore and Jordan Clarkson as our \u201cdecent\u201d replacements\u200a\u2014\u200aBazemore for Kawhi and LeBron, Clarkson for Westbrook and Harden. San Antonio fares the best because of its Belichickian infrastructure; it\u2019s hard to imagine them dipping below 47 wins even if Aldridge, Gasol, Ginobili, Green, Parker and Pop\u2019s beard were all better three years ago. On my podcast once, Seth Meyers described everything Lorne Michaels built as \u201cThe Machine\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200astars come and go, writers come and go, trends come and go, but the SNL machine keeps cranking out shows and remaining relevant. Trust the machine, Seth said. He might as well have been discussing the Spurs. And that\u2019s the best anti-Kawhi case other than his offensive impact (not nearly as profound as we usually expect from an MVP) and his workload (74 games, 33.4 MPG and just 2,474 total minutes). Only three MVPs played less than 2,650 minutes and weren\u2019t sidetracked by a lockout or strike: Curry in 2015 (2,613), Steve Nash in 2005 (2,573), and Bill Walton in the 1978 season (when he broke his foot, played just 1,929 minutes and still won). The Machine doesn\u2019t care; the Machine cares only about the playoffs. The Machine isn\u2019t built to spit out MVP candidates. If you switch Bazemore for LeBron, Cleveland gears its offense around Kyrie and Love and probably loses 18 to 20 wins, with an outside chance of turning into Portland East (a super-fun offensive team that can\u2019t guard anyone). Clarkson dents Houston and OKC in a more profound way; both teams would free-fall into the 20\u201325-win range. The Thunder\u2019s brain trust did everything possible to turn this post-KD season into a one-man MVP show, a savvy move for two reasons: They knew Russ wanted to shove it down Durant\u2019s throat, and they wanted to create a new narrative that wasn\u2019t \u201cKevin Durant ditched Oklahoma City for a bigger market and a franchise that might actually splurge on its players and try to keep the best ones.\u201d Replacing Westbrook with anyone this season would be like replacing Louis CK in a Louis CK special. As for Houston, remember when Mike D\u2019Antoni built Steve Nash a high-powered, ridiculously explosive race car in Phoenix that only Nash could drive? They did the same thing here: Every roster move and big-picture offensive decision was intended to leverage Harden\u2019s unparalleled slash-and-kick ability. D\u2019Antoni modernized that 2006 Suns car and accounted for better spacing, more 3s, and more screen-and-lobs, then handed the keys to Harden and stayed out of the way. You know who\u2019s driving that car into a wall? Jordan Clarkson. And since it\u2019s a steeper drop from 55 wins to 20\u201325 wins, Harden wins Question 1. Question 2: In a giant pickup game with every NBA player available and two knowledgeable fans forced to pick five-man teams, with their lives depending on the game\u2019s outcome, who would be the first player picked based on how everyone played that season? (Translation: Who\u2019s the alpha dog that\u00a0season?) Anyone who doesn\u2019t say \u201cLeBron\u201d is lying. You just are. For one game only, his ceiling is three floors higher than anyone else. We\u2019re all taking LeBron. Kawhi\u2019s defensive prowess makes him my second pick, especially if we\u2019re applying the Bob Ryan Doomsday Scenario\u200a\u2014\u200aif aliens landed and challenged us to a game of hoops, and we had to pick five guys to save the world. (I\u2019d want Kawhi just in case they had a 6-foot-9 alien with five arms that we needed to lock down.) I\u2019d pick Harden 3A and Westbrook 3B. If you have Russ, win or lose, Russ and only Russ is deciding the game\u2019s outcome. Is that a good thing? My biggest gripe with his 2016\u201317 campaign: his unwillingness to allow anyone else to do anything. I have one of those 100 percent full-blooded Italian moms who invites you over for dinner and does everything short of cutting your food and chewing it for you. Every pre-dinner exchange goes like this: Can we bring anything? No. Can we help in any way? No. Can I put salt on my food? No. Can I pour my own wine? No. That\u2019s Westbrook this season. He took 370 more shots than anyone else. He missed nearly 14 shots a game. He shattered the usage rate record (41.7%) and almost shattered the assist percentage rate (57.3%), a level of ball-hoggery that has no track record of ever translating to real NBA success (as covered in my Westbrook column last month). And yet, his night-to-night relentlessness was unlike anything that\u2019s ever happened in the league. Who played harder for six straight months than Russell Westbrook just did? Did you ever see Russ tired? Did you ever see him sweat? Did you ever see him breathing heavily? Have you ever seen a basketball star with a bottomless stamina tank? This wasn\u2019t an MVP season; this was performance art. Russell Westbrook gave more shits than anyone in the history of shits. And look, there\u2019s barely any difference between Westbrook\u2019s 32\u201311\u201310 and Harden\u2019s 29\u201311\u20138. (I\u2019d rather have the 29\u201311\u20138 and 400 more shots going to everyone else.) But the maniacal night-to-night drive that propelled Westbrook into the Oscar Club? Forty-two triple-doubles in 81 games? All those rebounds? All those times he went coast-to-coast, bounced off dudes like Zeke Elliott and finished in traffic? All those clutch shots when his legs should have been dead? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Could LeBron match that passion for any 48-minute game? Fuck yeah. But for 82 games? No way. With 14 years of NBA miles on him, he couldn\u2019t even do it for a month. LeBron wins Question 2, but Westbrook kind of wins it too. Question 3: If you\u2019re explaining your MVP pick to someone who has a favorite player in the race\u200a\u2014\u200aand your pick was a different player\u200a\u2014\u200awill he/she at least say something like, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like it, but I see how you arrived at that\u00a0choice\u201d? Anyone with half a basketball brain sees the cases for Kawhi, Harden and Westbrook. But if any Spurs, Rockets or Thunder fan heard a LeBron pick, they\u2019d immediately shriek, \u201cThey went 23\u201323 in their last 46! He had Kyrie and Love on his team! He won only four more games than Russ!\u201d Cross the King off. Stick him in fourth place. By the way, LeBron averaged 26\u20139\u20139, shot 55 percent and locked himself into another First-Team All-NBA selection and top-five MVP vote, which means he has the following streaks going: 1. Six straight Finals, with maybe a seventh coming 2. Twelve straight top-five MVP seasons 3. Ten straight First-Team All-NBAs 4. Thirteen straight seasons averaging at least a 25\u20136\u20136 5. He\u2019s still averaging a 27\u20137\u20137 with 50.1% shooting\u00a0\u2026 FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER. Don\u2019t shed any tears for LeBron\u2019s inevitable fourth-place MVP finish. He\u2019s fine. But if there were ever a season for LeBron to steal one last MVP trophy and pull even with MJ, this was the one. He won\u2019t ever get this close again, not unless he goes Lance Armstrong on us. If Maverick Carter starts flying to Germany every week this summer to allegedly raise funding for Space Jam 2, we\u2019ll know something\u2019s up. (Getty Images) Question 4: Ten years from now, who will be the first player from that season who pops into my head? (Every season belongs to someone to varying degrees.) The case for Kawhi: wins, efficiency, two-way play at the highest of levels. He\u2019s the NBA\u2019s third-best defensive player AND the league\u2019s sixth-best offensive player AND everyone\u2019s pick if we needed one defender to stop any great scorer in the last minute of any playoff game. The case against Kawhi: The 2016\u201317 season belonged to Westbrook\u2019s triple-double chase and the Durant-Russ feud, then the Warriors, then Harden and Moreyball, then the overflowing batch of explosive guards (Curry, Thomas, Wall, Lillard, Kyrie, etc.), then the unicorns (Giannis, Jokic, Porzingis, Embiid, maybe Towns), then LeBron\u2019s bizarre Cavs season, then Tankapalooza 2017\u00a0\u2026 and maybe THEN you\u2019d remember Kawhi and the Spurs? He would own the NBA season less than any MVP I can ever remember. Just for fun, here\u2019s \u201cwho owned the season\u201d in the 21st century. 2000: Shaq (MVP), then C-Webb/Kings2001: Iverson (MVP), then Peak Shaqobe2002: Duncan (MVP), then Kidd/Nets, then C-Webb/Kings2003: Duncan (MVP), then T-Mac\u2019s monster season2004: Garnett (MVP), then the bizarre Lakers (and Kobe\u2019s trial)2005: Nash (MVP), then Shaq/Miami, then the Artest melee2006: Kobe, then Nash (MVP), then Dirk/Mavs2007: Nash/Suns, then Dirk (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs2008: KG/Celts, then Kobe (MVP), then CP3, then T-Mac/Houston2009: LeBron (MVP), then Kobe/Lakers2010: LeBron (MVP), then Kobe/L.A., then Nash/Suns2011: Rose (MVP), then LeBron/Wade/Bosh2012: LeBron (MVP), then Lob City, then Durant/OKC, then Boston\u2019s last stand2013: LeBron (MVP), then the Harden trade2014: Durant (MVP), then LeBron/Miami, then Duncan/Spurs2015: Curry (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs, then Harden, then Westbrook2016: Curry (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs, then Durant/Westbrook You could glance at any of those names and say, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s when [blank] happened.\u201d That\u2019s happening with MVP Kawhi and the 2017 Spurs? Come on. I spent the past week trying to talk myself into him\u200a\u2014\u200abecause of San Antonio\u2019s success, and because they\u2019d never have anyone chase an MVP award like Westbrook did (and, to a lesser degree, like Harden did). But I couldn\u2019t get there. It\u2019s my own fault. I want my MVP to stand out in some uniquely impactful way. It\u2019s not baseball. It\u2019s not the Advanced Metrics Award. There\u2019s a performance art/water cooler/alpha dog wrinkle that Kawhi just never offered, mainly because the Pop Machine would never want him to have it. He\u2019s my third-place MVP pick. Spoiler alert: I\u2019m not voting for Westbrook, either. Was Russ the FUN pick? Absolutely. Did he own the season? Absolutely\u200a\u2014\u200ahe won Question No. 4. But he wasn\u2019t playing for the 2001 Sixers; he didn\u2019t have to do absolutely everything at the expense of never developing/nurturing/testing anyone else. Remember when we came out of the 2016 playoffs raving about how much we liked Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, and Andre Roberson? Why didn\u2019t they get any better? Why wasn\u2019t Adams as devastating in OKC as the Capela-Nene-Harrell trio was for Houston? Why wasn\u2019t Oladipo BETTER on a much better team? Why did they dump Ersan Ilyasova after only three games, and why wasn\u2019t it a bigger deal when he thrived in Philly and Atlanta? Why such a wasted rookie year for Domantas Sabonis? Everyone acts like Russ is playing with the Washington Generals\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has two top-three lottery picks and three other lottery picks in their playing rotation. Kanter and Oladipo have near-max deals. Adams has a nine-figure deal coming. Ilyasova scored 15 a night on Philadelphia. Those guys sucked? If a superstar guarantees you 45 wins, then Westbrook dragged them to\u00a0\u2026 47 wins? What? Meanwhile, the Rockets were pegged as a fringe playoff team with only one All-Star and even lower expectations than OKC. And we didn\u2019t know what to expect with Harden. After he finished second in the 2015 MVP voting, the Dwightbola virus turned him into a smoke-and-mirrors superstar last season. Why didn\u2019t it seem like he cared? Was he turning into a glorified DH? This year, a rejuvenated Harden grabbed the point guard reins (why doesn\u2019t he get more credit for switching positions, by the way?), made a bunch of role players better and transformed the Rockets into the league\u2019s second-best offense. And not just that\u200a\u2014\u200athey finished with one of the TEN BEST REGULAR-SEASON OFFENSES OF All TIME. (Here, look.) (Getty Images) Did Harden resonate as a performer like Westbrook did? Of course not. How do you compete with the NBA\u2019s John Wick? Just don\u2019t sleep on Harden\u2019s magical passing, his Ginobili 2.0 slash-and-kick game, his famous Eurosteps, his surreal ability to find open shooters from every conceivable angle, his heat-check 3s, his occasional WTF box scores (an MVP staple), his annoyingly effective tactic of leaping suddenly into off-balance defenders for fake 3s (he\u2019s the master at getting those calls), and his herky-jerky southpaw game that\u2019s basically a one of one. You\u2019d defend Russ by playing off him and hoping he jacks up 3s. You\u2019d have no idea how to defend Harden. He\u2019s just as durable as Westbrook, he\u2019s almost as relentless and he\u2019s even more dangerous because he uses everyone else on his team. And if you plugged this Harden season into a normal NBA year, when we weren\u2019t obsessing over feuds, triple-doubles, body language, an endless barrage of 50-point games and everything else? We would have run out of ways to write Harden-D\u2019Antoni comeback pieces two months ago. They figured out a better way to do Nash\u2019s Suns while nearly reenacting Tiny Archibald\u2019s legendary points-assists season? What???? But in that crowded 2017 landscape, Harden\u2019s mega-season has yielded only some kudos, Chris Ryan\u2019s Oscar contender Moreyball and that\u2019s it. I loved watching Westbrook this season. Repeat: I loved it. I never imagined we\u2019d see a Big O/triple-double sequel, just like I never imagined that Kobe could average 35 a game, or that Ron Artest could fight an entire section of Pistons fans without getting shanked. But if it\u2019s down to Harden and Westbrook, and both sides are relatively equal, and we\u2019re voting on offensive impact and team success over everything else and that breakdown comes down to this\u00a0\u2026 47 wins, 17th-ranked offense, zero chance of winning the title 55 wins, second-ranked offense (10th all time), puncher\u2019s chance of winning the title \u2026 I mean, what are we arguing about? And why the hell did it take me so long? I\u2019m picking James Harden.
