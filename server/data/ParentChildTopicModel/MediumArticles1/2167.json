These negotiations will not have any legal force but instead will prototype what it might be like for a large conference on design to try explicitly to design the future of design research.

To break with a too dyadic version of argumentation, each Debate will involve 3 participants, speaking for and against 3 distinct propositions. The following briefing papers are informing the resolutions that the invited Debaters will propose at the conference. (Speculative) Futures in Design\u00a0Research Design realizes preferred futures. The process for getting to the nature of preferred supposedly involves balancing a) the radical and the feasible (what Raymond Loewy called the Most Advanced yet Acceptable) b) the long-term and the short-term c) the particularities of some and what suits most (since design is the art and/or science of mass production for mass consumption) The centrality of futures and futuring to design suggests that core skills taught to research-based designers is: i) foresighting ii) scenario planning iii) backcasting Despite Futures being a moderately substantial discipline and practice, few Design Schools seem to explicitly teach its principles and techniques (though titling degree programs Design Futures seems currently in vogue).

Without robust approaches to futuring, designing seems easily dominated by technological solutions in search of problems, or worse, more or less random A/B tests in search of monetizable scale. Design Researchers needs to reassert the role of Design Research in Futuring and Futuring in Design Research. (Sustainable) Design Research for\u00a0Change Design is the expert practice of change-making.
