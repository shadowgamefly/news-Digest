Listen, we need The Kardashians to die hard and\u00a0tragic. We need them to stop inspiring Instagram and Vogue with visuals that have sent Millennials spiraling out of control as they penetrate their trust funds in an effort to Keep Up with lies that aim to render them years over what they should be inhabiting. The Kardashians must be laid to rest because they amazingly shifted pop culture in a direction that won\u2019t be thoroughly scrubbed away until the world finally finds a cure for viral narcissism.
