But why does your app need a good architecture? A simple answer is that everything should be organized in a proper way. So does your Android project. If not, the following problems sounds familiar to you: So, if you are going to build a high-quality app, you should care about the architecture. What does your app get from a proper architecture? Several upcoming questions maybe appear in your head. - So, what is the best architecture pattern for my Android apps? - And how can I apply that pattern in the most effective way? There is no single candidate that suits for all of your Android projects because design pattern is abstract and its implementation depends on specific requirements. Fortunately, the more we understand about it, the more effective and proper we apply them. You can use different architectures across different apps. Even, in one complex project, each module has its own structure. Another question? So, if I have never used any architecture in my Android apps yet. So, what should I do? Just pick up one of them. Read about it, try to apply it. After that you will become familiar to it and have your own best practices. Developers out there are talking about these following popular patterns: These architecture pattern above made me really confused at the first time. However, let\u2019s go with one of them and see how it works, after that you can understand the remaining ones. MVP in\u00a0Android MVP is strongly recommended because a lot of developers are using it now. Even, Google also provide its best practice example on Github. Definition is not always an interesting part but it is super important. We should even check it out again an again to understand it deeply. Image Credit: Tin\u00a0Megali Important points of MVP are: A small example This \u201chello-mvp\u201d app has been defined by two following functions: A simple version of the Model look likes this. The following contract keeps both functions of the View and the Presenter. It is a good guideline to keep track of their relationship. You need a concrete Presenter class in implementation. An implementation of the View is an Activity.(or a Fragment if you prefer that way). Above example is just a simple approach of applying MVP to Android apps. Hope that you find your own best practices for your projects. The full source code of can be found on Github repository. Finally, there are many resources about MVP in Android out there, but I highly recommend some of them which are listed below. The more we learn about it, the more effective we implement it. You can find how Dependency Injection works with MVP in the second article of this series\u00a0. Thank you for reading! Have a good time and happy coding \u2764\u00a0.
