Within minutes of talking to this girl we learned that: She didn\u2019t want to make fruit salad. She wanted to create a brand. She didn\u2019t want it to be fresh, good and hand-made, she wanted it to be cheap, fast and easy. She didn\u2019t want to serve a specific group of people, she wanted to serve everyone.

But she wasn\u2019t. When you want to start a fruit salad business, here\u2019s what any person with common sense would do: 1. Make fruit salad. 2. Try to sell it. You don\u2019t need a business plan for that, you don\u2019t need a team, you don\u2019t need an office and you sure as hell don\u2019t need $1,000,000 in funding. But common sense is in short supply in startup land these days. It seems to me the majority of founders confuse startup ideas with business ideas. There\u2019s a huge difference between the two. Most people have lots of business ideas. They\u2019re a dime a dozen. Very few people have true startup ideas. Startup world, if I could recommend just one book to you to solve all of this, I\u2019d say: Zero To One. Read Peter Thiel\u2019s book, Zero To\u00a0One. Here are the two main things it\u2019ll teach you: 1. The difference between a startup and a normal business. Two of the key traits of startups are: This makes startups well-suited to solve big, important problems by doing things in an entirely new way, instead of making incremental progress. According to Thiel, one is horizontal (like globalization, which scales and extends what exists already), the other vertical (like technology, which gives us a new way of doing things). The benefit of building a startup in Thiel\u2019s sense is that it can, if successful, turn into a monopoly, which ensures profits for a long time, that can then be used to created further, vertical progress. Here are the 4 key traits of a monopoly: Let\u2019s look at two examples. Google was a\u00a0startup. Before Google, no other search engine had developed a proper, proprietary technology it bases its results on. Yahoo had just gobbled together something from all the companies they had acquired, and so Google won. It\u2019s been a monopoly since pretty much 2000, when it first indexed more sites than any other search engine and Yahoo caved: they started using Google\u2019s technology. Google still reaps the profits of that monopoly 17 years later. If you\u2019re thinking about replacing the car as a means of transport, making grocery stores unnecessary or a way to use electric power in your house without sockets, those might be startup ideas. For a true startup idea, no one will ever tell you that \u201cit\u2019s a great idea,\u201d because what you\u2019re suggesting is unheard of. People will think you\u2019re crazy and you\u2019ll have to fight long and hard to convince the world. But if you pull it off, you\u2019ll make it a much better place. To find out if your startup idea is worth launching: Then, you can put your heart and soul into it and even if it falls flat on its face, you won\u2019t regret a single day spent on it. DuckDuckGo is a business. It doesn\u2019t replace or succeed search the way we do it now, but instead is another player in the search engine industry. DuckDuckGo creates competition. It\u2019s carved out a niche for itself (focus on privacy) and it\u2019s successful, but it\u2019s not a \u201cstartup\u201d in Peter Thiel\u2019s sense. If you\u2019re thinking about starting a lemonade stand, coding a fitness app, creating a content management software, video community website or new productivity tool, those are all business ideas. These are the kinds of ideas your friends will tell you are \u201cgreat ideas.\u201d To find out if they\u2019re worth launching: That\u2019s it. By getting some people to pay, you know your business idea is valid and it won\u2019t fall flat on its face. There. No risk involved. No capital needed. The second thing the book will teach you is this: 2. Which questions will help you find true startup\u00a0ideas? Based on Thiel\u2019s definition, you can use a variety of questions to pinpoint whether what you\u2019re about to embark on fits the idea of a startup. Here are the most important ones from the book: A lot of startups fail. At least 75%. And that\u2019s 75% of those, which have received funding already. I\u2019m not going to start a startup for the foreseeable future, but if I ever, this is the setup I\u2019ll use. When you use these questions to find your idea, run it through Thiel\u2019s filter and it passes, I think you\u2019ll have a decent shot. Then it\u2019s just years of failing, uphill battles and hard work and who knows, maybe, one day, the world will look back and think of you as someone who invented the future. Unless we change our thinking, we\u2019ll soon burn more money, time, energy and human ambition than we have in a long, long time. Even watching from the sidelines hurts so much I want to grab the entire industry by the collar, shake it and say: \u201cFRUIT SALAD?! What the fuck is wrong with you?!\u201d But I thought I\u2019d ask nicely first. So hey startup world, can you think of real ideas?\u00a0Please! Think it\u2019s smart?
