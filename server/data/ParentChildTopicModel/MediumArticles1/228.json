Start today, right now, to eliminate them from your life. When you do, you\u2019ll open up room for new positive habits to take their place. Any or all of these 10 habits is a good place to start because maybe all of them are destroying your happiness. 1. Postponing your\u00a0goals. Procrastination will keep you from reaching your goals more effectively than any external obstacle. Start today by taking one baby step toward a goal. Do the same the next day. It doesn\u2019t have to be much, but do something every day. Consistent effort is the key. 2. Living a mediocre\u00a0life. Step out of your comfort zone and remember that many of the greatest pleasures in life include some degree of risk. Happiness is not about avoiding the painful things in life; it\u2019s about chasing our dreams and aspirations. 3. Self-sabotaging. Any pattern that keeps disrupting your growth, your success, or your happiness has to stop. What\u2019s keeping you stuck? Find it and then find your way out of it. Develop patterns that support your highest goals. 4. Running from your problems. Start chasing the right things instead of running from what\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t look at problems as something to be ashamed of or avoid, but as an opportunity to learn and grow. 5. Worrying about your\u00a0flaws. Everyone has flaws, but it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019ll give them the power to keep you from doing what you want. Instead, take your flaws, find your strength in them, and make them work for you. 6. Trying to control everything. Control is an illusion. If you try to control everything, you will quickly become frustrated and angry. Instead, remember the only thing you can reliably control is your own reaction to the things going on around you and within you. To have command of yourself is a much more reliable source of happiness than trying to control everything around you. 7. Blaming\u00a0others. Nothing great has ever come from blaming or accusing others. The way to really be happy is to be accountable for your actions and responsible for your own consequences. 8. Trying to be something you are\u00a0not. Why do so many people want to be something they are not? What would it take to be happy with who you are, and celebrate your gifts and talents? Don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone else. Look in the mirror and see who you are\u200a\u2014\u200aand build on that foundation. 9. Living in the past or in the\u00a0future. The trick is to stay in the present long enough to truly figure out what makes you happy. What memories can you create today? What choices can you make to start creating happiness? 10. Constant complaining. Did you wake up in a bed? Do you have shelter and food? Don\u2019t take the necessities of life for granted. Be grateful for all of life\u2019s blessings: food, health, relationships, your mind, your heart. When you catch yourself complaining, take a moment to look around you in gratitude.
