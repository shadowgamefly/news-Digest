Everything appeared to be normal. People were going about their lives, unaware of the immense change undergone by the man being buried. His eyes, closed, begin their sightless stare into eternity. He is once more lying near his wife. She had been waiting there for the past six years. The two, looking from beneath, silently turning, faces upwards. Two people, side by side to turn together forever silently as the earth rotates. Left to spin slowly until the ground reclaims. My thoughts were drifting, I wondered, Where was the mind of this man? Memory repositories beneath the ground, redundant, soon to dissolve, no chance of asking him questions now. I thought, Everyone is saying how beautiful the flowers look. Do they realize that a man has been put from the face of the earth, never to be part of life again? Perhaps they do, maybe I need to understand this. My mind was spiraling into itself. A local man came up to me saying, \u201cIt was time.\u201d I was startled. I asked him in an exchange of small talk how things were at home, and he said, \u201cOh quiet, you know, nothing changes.\u201d Odd that he could say that. I thought, How could there be no change, do people forget so quickly? Something had changed, and they were witnessing it. Eighty-two years of etching his mark but where was he now? He must have made some impression other than that of fuel for the memory banks of those still living. 1956: \u201cStand back from the window; you\u2019ll be seen,\u201d said my grandmother. \u201cI want to see too,\u201d I said\u200a\u2014\u200aall of 6. \u201cWell, so do I, but there are ways of doing it, just peep through the side of the blind.\u201d said my grandmother in fear of the blinds flapping as the funeral cortege passed. \u201cHere is the first car; it will be and Bill and June.

A mother, my mind flicked to the coffin. So that it could mean something; one could be a father as well then. But if nothing ever changes perhaps this didn\u2019t mean enough.
