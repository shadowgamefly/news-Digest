Looking for\u00a0insight Insight is a term that is used in different ways, it\u2019s something of buzzword at the moment which means we need to define it precisely first. When we talk about insight in this article it\u2019s an actionable expression of human behaviour and the associated motivation. The difference between a \u2018finding\u2019 and an \u2018insight\u2019 isn\u2019t always apparent, generally an insight should feel inspiring to the designer in you. For example a \u2018finding\u2019 might look like this: Patients are often non-compliant, this makes their conditions worsen and GPs frustrated. This is valuable information to have found, but until we understand what causes the behaviour it will be difficult to design to improve the situation. An insight looks more like this: Patients are so nervous during appointments that they don\u2019t listen to their doctors. This is much more actionable as it highlights the underlying behaviour. To get to this underlying behaviour you basically need to keep asking why. At this point you can\u2019t quickly speak to the person you interviewed, but if you took good notes you should be able to piece together the answer. If you find it difficult to identify the underlying behaviour from your notes this is a good point to reflect on how you\u2019d approach the interview next time. Insights should be common across different research activities, if you have an insight drawn from only one or two interviews you should question how broadly applicable it is. The richest insights are supported by multiple research activities with data points, quotes, photos and observations all pointing to the same thing. You should be able to identify anything between 3 and 8 insights. Less might suggest your research didn\u2019t cover a wide enough range of people. More than 8 suggests that you\u2019ve not been critical enough and might be expressing the same insight multiple times. Grouping emerging\u00a0themes Begin by pulling post-it notes together into logical groups. Don\u2019t worry so much about the precise nature of each group, follow your collective instinct about what feels right. You may find that an area that felt strong in your head doesn\u2019t come together; or that disparate notes suddenly align. Equally others in the your team may spot patterns you had missed. Switch between confidently leading the discussion and humbly letting others lead you. As insights come together, quick names can help set them in your mind. Spending time and discussing the names of areas is important, the names you give might encompass other notes that haven\u2019t yet found a home in a group. Once a clear set of insight groups has come together, look what\u2019s left\u200a\u2014\u200ado they form a group of their own? Perhaps they start to fall away as they fail to make it into a group. Don\u2019t remove any notes yet, if they made it onto the wall they need to stick around for a little longer. Keep jumping between the groups you\u2019ve found and the left over notes. Telling stories As you review post-it notes, stories can help remind you of the user\u2019s point of view and the original observation; it might also help you remember more details from the interview. When i\u2019m working with a group and the conversations have dried up, I ask someone to tell me a story (any story will do) from the notes on the wall. It\u2019s amazing how quickly it opens up group conversation again. How to get\u00a0unstuck While I might be making the process of synthesis seem straightforward and logical, you will inevitably get stuck and feel lost.

Finding insight There isn\u2019t a perfect formula for an insight, but there are a few questions you can ask: If you answer yes to all of these questions you\u2019re probably in a good place.
