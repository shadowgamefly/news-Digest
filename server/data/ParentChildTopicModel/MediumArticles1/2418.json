Or maybe customers or partners and employees would be more inclined to work with Marc Benioff at Salesforce.com who has put protection of the social rights of his employees front-and-center in how Salesforce conducts business. Lastly we had to talk about \u201cthe dossier.\u201d Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it?\u00a0:) I wanted to ask Jonah about the decision of BuzzFeed to publish the dossier of Donald Trump and his potential interest in rather exotic showers in Russia and whether that may have influenced his treatment of the US relationship with Russia to to \u201ckompromat\u201d (compromising information potentially held about Trump). While the BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith had spoken about it publicly I had never heard any statements from BuzzFeed\u2019s CEO. You have to watch the video to get the full story (starting just after 23:30)\u200a\u2014\u200abut in essence it boils down to this: And Jonah stands by this decision stating that since the publication of the dossier a lot more research has gone into the claims and a lot of progress has been made in researching and tracking down details that wouldn\u2019t have happened had they not published it. He said reasonable people could come to different conclusions about this decision but they stand by their choice and he said anybody wanting to understand this better should watch this video between Brian Stelter and Ben Smith. If you have any interest in the future of online media or even better understanding fake news, why it exists and what to do about it\u200a\u2014\u200ado yourself and watch this short 30-minute video interview. Jonah is truly a pioneer in online media. ", "child": "2418_1\t2418_2\t2418_3\t2418_4\t2418_5"}
