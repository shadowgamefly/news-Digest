We\u2019re going to take the actions necessary to secure our family\u2019s privacy against the acts of reckless monopolies and their political puppets.

Step 1: enable HTTPS Everywhere As I mentioned, ISPs can work around HTTPS if they are able to factory-install spyware on your phone\u2019s operating system. As long as you can avoid buying those models of phones, HTTPS will give you a huge amount of additional protection.

For example, someone visiting Cars.com may be in the market for a new car, and someone visiting BabyCenter.com may be pregnant. That\u2019s where using a VPN comes in. How VPNs can protect\u00a0you VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. People have traditionally used VPNs as a way to get around websites that are blocked in their country (for example, Medium is blocked in Malaysia) or to watch movies that aren\u2019t available in certain countries. But VPNs are extremely useful for privacy, too. There are several types of VPN options, with varying degrees of convenience and security. Experts estimate that as many as 90% of VPNs are \u201chopelessly insecure\u201d and this changes from time to time. So even if you use the tools I recommend here, I recommend you take the time to do your homework. Browser-based VPNs Most VPNs are services that cost money. But the first VPN option I\u2019m going to tell you about is convenient and completely free. Opera is a popular web browser that comes with some excellent privacy features, like a free built-in VPN and a free ad blocker (and as you may know, ads can spy on you). If you just want a secure way to browse the web without ISPs being able to easily snoop on you and sell your data, Opera is a great start. Let\u2019s install and configure it real quick. This takes less than 5 minutes. Before you get started, note that this will only anonymize the things you do within the Opera browser. Also, I\u2019m obligated to point out that even though Opera\u2019s parent company is European, it was recently purchased by a consortium of Chinese tech companies, and there is a non-zero risk that it could be compromised by the Chinese government. Having said that, here\u2019s how to browse securely with Opera: Step #1: Download the Opera browser Step #2: Turn on its ad blocker Step #3: Turn on its VPN Step #4: Install HTTPS Everywhere When you\u2019re done, Opera should look like this: Presto\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can now browse the web with reasonable confidence that your ISPs\u200a\u2014\u200aor really anyone else \u2014don\u2019t know who you are or what you\u2019re doing. You can even set your VPN to a different country. Here, I\u2019ve set mine to Singapore so websites will think I\u2019m in Singapore. To test this out, I visited ipleak.net and they did indeed think I was in Singapore. Since the internet is complex, and data passes through hundreds of providers through a system of peering and trading traffic, US-based ISPs shouldn\u2019t be able to monitor my traffic when it emerges from Singapore.

If you want to use a VPN at the router level, and your internet connection is less than 100 mps, this router will probably suffice. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to pay a bit more for a router like this one. If you don\u2019t trust the router companies, you can modify a router using Tomato USB. It\u2019s an alternative open source Linux-based router firmware that\u2019s compatible with some off-the-shelf routers. Privacy is hard. But it\u2019s worth\u00a0it. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and has been declared so by the United Nations. Still, many people believe we live in a \u201cpost-privacy\u201d era. For example, Mark Zuckerberg claims privacy isn\u2019t that important any more. But look at his actions. He paid $30 million to buy the 4 houses adjacent to his Palo Alto home so he could have more privacy. Other people are just too jaded and shell-shocked by all the data breaches around us to believe that privacy is still worth the fight. But most people who say they don\u2019t care about their own privacy anymore just haven\u2019t really given it much thought. \u201cArguing that you don\u2019t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don\u2019t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEdward\u00a0Snowden Last week\u2019s US Senate vote is just the latest in a series of events that show how we can\u2019t trust governments to act in the interest of consumers when it comes to their privacy. We need stronger privacy protections enshrined in the law. In the meantime, we\u2019ll just have to look out for ourselves, and educate other people to do the same. I encourage you to read computer security expert Bruce Schneier\u2019s book \u201cData and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.\u201d I learned a ton from it, and am listening to it a second time.
