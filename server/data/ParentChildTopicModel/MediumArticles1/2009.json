The reason centers tend to snap the ball between their legs is not because it\u2019s the only legal way, but because they need to be in position to block right after the snap. If Butts\u200a\u2014\u200aBUTTS!\u200a\u2014\u200ahad been facing a pass rush here after a snap that turned his body perpendicular to the line, he would\u2019ve been in trouble."}, {"368e": "Second: What about the fact that the ball is THROWN TO THE GUY WHO SNAPPED IT? What the hell?"}, {"94c7": "Well, that\u2019s kosher too. It has to do with how the team is lined up:"}, {"bc35": "A team must have seven players on the line of scrimmage for a formation to be legal. Of these seven, the five in the middle are ineligible to catch a pass, and the two on the ends are eligible. In almost every scenario, the guy snapping the ball is one of the five ineligible, since teams normally surround the center with other offensive linemen."}, {"cbba": "Not here!

So throughout the day, we\u2019ll be celebrating the weird and wonderful moments that this silly sport has to offer. Grab an oatmeal creme pie and hang with us, won\u2019t you? Most Meaningful Result College football crowds learned how to wear identically colored shirts some time ago, but it still feels different when Penn State does it. The Happy Valley White Out was on this week, and the crowd was so loud that players seemingly couldn\u2019t hear whistles blowing plays dead. Fans had reason to cheer: The hometown Nittany Lions handed the visiting Ohio State Buckeyes, ranked second nationally and in the thick of the national championship race, their first loss on the year, 24\u201321. The Buckeyes got ahead early, but crumpled after taking a 21\u20137 lead, ultimately dooming themselves by allowing 10 points off of special teams screwery: On back-to-back fourth-quarter drives, Penn State blocked a punt and a field goal. The first gave the Nittany Lions the ball in field goal range, while the second was returned for a touchdown that wound up being the game winner. Ohio State had a chance to drive for a win, but the Buckeyes offense proved capable of little more than checkdowns. To this point in the season, we seemed destined for an Ohio State\u2013Michigan matchup of infinite importance. I mean, if you ask their fans, EVERY Ohio State\u2013Michigan game is of infinite importance, but this year the two teams actually appeared destined to face off as undefeateds for the right to play in the Big Ten championship game. The Game can still have College Football Playoff implications, though, as long as Urban Meyer\u2019s club avoids another stumble. As this upset should remind us, the Wolverines could also lose. But if they don\u2019t, and if both teams win all of their contests between now and November 26, the Buckeyes could topple Michigan and make the conference title game thanks to the head-to-head tiebreaker. And if the Bucks win that game, they\u2019d be 12\u20131 and a shoo-in for the playoff. After all, Ohio State has lost a weird game and gone on to make and win the playoff before. You might not remember\u200a\u2014\u200ait was a whole two seasons ago. But after needing overtime to survive Wisconsin in Week 7 and failing to even get that far against Penn State, I wonder if that\u2019s reasonable to expect. The passing game was inefficient, with J.T. Barrett netting only 5.7 yards per attempt. The hypertalented receivers couldn\u2019t get open, and the recently studly offensive line couldn\u2019t keep Barrett safe for more than a few seconds, even when Penn State wasn\u2019t blitzing. There was a 74-yard run by Curtis Samuel, but the receiver/RB hybrid got only two carries. Meanwhile, primary back Mike Weber managed just 71 yards on 21 carries. In an Ohio State fan\u2019s dream world, this was all caused by the white shirts, and the Buckeyes will snap back to being a juggernaut next week. But the problems in Columbus seem to go beyond attire at this point. Least Surprising Thing Texas A&M\u2013Alabama was THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE DAY: When the undefeated and top-ranked team in the country hosts the undefeated and sixth-ranked team in the country, we pay attention. But it was also a blowout, and that seemed normal: The Crimson Tide were 18-point favorites, and ended up winning by 19. Defensive end Jonathan Allen returned a fumble for a touchdown, meaning Alabama has now scored as many touchdowns on defense and special teams combined (12) as it has allowed overall. Oh, Allen also did this: AHHHH THAT\u2019S NOT A PERSON THAT\u2019S A TORPEDO. TORPEDOES SHOULDN\u2019T BE ALLOWED TO PLAY FOOTBALL. Texas A&M is good! The Aggies entered Saturday 6\u20130, with three wins over ranked teams and another win over Auburn, which wasn\u2019t ranked when the two played, but is now. That\u2019s good!!!! But the Aggies really didn\u2019t look like they belonged on the same field as Alabama. They briefly took a 14\u201313 lead in the third quarter, but then Bama decided it was time for carnage. The Tide have now played five games against ranked teams, and have won those games by an average of 25.6 points. We\u2019re used to Nick Saban\u2019s squad beating a lot of good teams, but this year Alabama is yawning while crushing the opposition. I\u2019m sure a lot of the buildings that Godzilla destroyed in Tokyo were very nicely built, capable of resisting massive earthquakes and what not. But Godzilla was too busy demolishing them to notice. College Football\u2019s Best Defender Is a PoetTexas A&M star Myles Garrett is so much more than a pass rushertheringer.com Most Stuff,\u00a0Overall Football video games in 2016 are amazing, but sometimes they\u2019re too demanding. I don\u2019t always want to have to think. Sometimes I\u2019m just trying to have fun, and a game forces me to read the defensive end and figure out whether the opposition is lined up in Cover 3. That\u2019s too much work. Sometimes I just want to put up dozens of touchdowns against a virtual opponent, and that\u2019s when I bust out my PS2 and pop in an old classic, Oklahoma vs. Texas Tech. The Sooners and Red Raiders each put up 854 yards on Saturday night, combining for an NCAA record 1,708 total. That\u2019s 5,124 feet of offense, or\u00a0.9705 miles. The two teams combined for 17 touchdowns and four punts. Texas Tech\u2019s Patrick Mahomes tied an NCAA record with 734 yards passing. He also led his team in rushing with 85 yards and two touchdowns. It\u2019s one of the greatest statistical single-game performances of all time. Oh, by the way: His team LOST, 66\u201359. To clarify: This dude set the all-time record for total yards and also scored while running the ball AND IT WASN\u2019T GOOD ENOUGH. Step your game up, Pat! Patrick Mahomes Isn\u2019t Another System QuarterbackKliff Kingsbury\u2019s latest muse is a breakout startheringer.com Is there such a thing as too much offense? Is there a point at which the complete failure of two defenses to do anything meaningful actually ruins our ability to enjoy a game? No, no there is not. Go for 900 yards next time, Pat. Best Performance by Lamar\u00a0Jackson Getty Images The Louisville quarterback and Heisman Trophy front-runner deserves his own category. At this point, it\u2019s unfair to put anybody else on his level. Jackson obliterated NC State on Saturday, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns while running for a fourth in the Cardinals\u2019 44\u20130 win. NC State, by the way, is not a bad team, having forced overtime against Clemson last week. Ahh, wait: Those were his halftime stats, and that was Louisville\u2019s halftime lead. This isn\u2019t an attempt to cop out of writing about the second half. Remember: It\u2019s not just that Alexander the Great conquered the entire known world; it\u2019s that he did so by the time he was 32. The Heisman Race That Wasn\u2019tWhy college football\u2019s most touted backs failed to live up to the hypetheringer.com Some people might be growing tired of hearing about Jackson\u2019s eye-popping numbers. Why should we get excited about another large number of yards and large number of touchdowns after already fawning over his big days against Charlotte, Syracuse, Florida State, Marshall, Clemson, and Duke? If that\u2019s happening to you, I\u2019d recommend actually watching Jackson. My breath still disappears every time I see him launching ludicrous lasers and whistling by would-be tacklers at warp speed. Best Performance, Non\u2013Lamar Jackson\u00a0Edition Utah\u2019s Joe Williams torched UCLA, putting up 332 yards and four touchdowns in a 52\u201345 Utes win. Remember when UCLA was ranked? Yeah, look at this: Williams totaled the most rushing yards of any player this season, passing BYU\u2019s Jamaal Williams in some quality Utahn usurpation. He also set the Utah school record and tallied the most rushing yards by any Pac-12 player since 2012. That\u2019s all incredible enough. But it\u2019s even more impressive from Williams, who announced his retirement from football about a month ago, citing injuries and \u201ca loss of desire.\u201d He\u2019d managed only 75 yards in the team\u2019s first two games, and he\u2019d lost two fumbles, and Kyle Whittingham yelled at him very prominently on camera. It seemed he didn\u2019t feel it was worth it. But the Utes got really dinged up at running back\u200a\u2014\u200aREALLY dinged up\u200a\u2014\u200aand came calling for Williams. He ran for 179 yards and a TD last week, and this week, he set a dang school record. It seems safe to say that unretiring was a good idea. Who do you guys think is going to win the NBA\u2019s MVP award this year? I see a lot of people picking LeBron or Steph, but after Williams\u2019s Saturday, I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s going to be Kobe. Biggest Humiliation LSU\u2019s Leonard Fournette, who last played on September 24, returned from his ankle injury on Saturday. I\u2019d say he\u2019s healthy. Few running backs have brutalized defenders the way Fournette has. And this was one of his finest works. The player Fournette nearly flipped is Deontay Anderson, a true freshman for Ole Miss whom ESPN ranked as the top safety in this past year\u2019s recruiting class. Pretty good! Unfortunately, Fournette, who finished the night with 284 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries, is one of the top-ranked anythings in the history of everything. College football generally pits players of the same age range and developmental status against each other. But that\u2019s a man trucking a teenager. Worst Week Ohio State\u2019s loss might seem like the headliner, and in terms of potential playoff impacts, it is; but when it comes to sheer shock value, no. 11 Houston\u2019s blowout 38\u201316 loss to SMU is actually the worst defeat any ranked team suffered in Week 8. To understand how big of an upset this was, consider that the Mustangs hadn\u2019t beaten a top-15 opponent since 1986. That year, SMU was in its last throes as a powerhouse thanks to the strategy of openly buying elite players. In 1987, the NCAA hit the program with its now-infamous death penalty, and in the 30 years since, the Mustangs hadn\u2019t bested a club of Houston\u2019s caliber. Congrats to SMU on the win; hopefully it can get another one before 2046. Meanwhile, the loss capped a horrendous week for Houston. Just a few days ago, the Cougars had a pretty good chance of earning the Group of Five\u2019s spot in the New Year\u2019s Six bowl games. And more importantly, the program appeared to be on the verge of being announced as a new member of the Big 12, meaning that in future seasons, Tom Herman\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t even have to worry about the difficulties of being relevant in a little league. They\u2019d be made. But the Big 12 decided not to expand. (Perhaps some Big 12 teams feared adding a very competitive team from the same state that produces the majority of Big 12 recruits.) And suddenly, Houston isn\u2019t even favored to win the league it\u2019s now forced to keep calling home. It really is all bad news: The Cougars\u2019 second loss isn\u2019t going to be damning enough to prevent Herman, their brilliant head coach, from getting poached at year\u2019s end. In a week, Houston\u2019s bright future turned into a mediocre present. Please don\u2019t leave, Paul Wall\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re all that\u2019s left. Weakest Coaching\u00a0Decision Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz likely finds toasting bread exotic. Despite this\u200a\u2014\u200abecause of this?\u200a\u2014\u200athe school recently gave him a massive contract extension that will pay him $4.5 million until 2026. The Hawkeyes did this even though it seems unlikely that a man who probably considers milk hard liquor was itching to leave a school he\u2019s worked at since 1999. Against no. 10 Wisconsin on Saturday, Ferentz flexed his ironclad dedication to timidity. In the first quarter, an Iowa receiver was ruled inches short of the first-down marker at the Wisconsin 49. Ferentz INSTANTLY sent his punt team on the field instead of going for it on fourth down, seizing the opportunity to give his opponent the ball. But his masterpiece came with only five minutes to go. Down 14\u20136, the Hawkeyes faced a fourth-and-5 at the Wisconsin 20. In a one-possession game, his decision was clear-cut. Go for it! You need a touchdown! You don\u2019t need a field goal! And kicking a field goal gives the opponent the ball with five minutes left! Ferentz called for a field goal. His kicker missed. When asked to explain his decision after the game, Ferentz gave an answer that seemingly implied he doesn\u2019t know that two-point conversions exist. You\u2019d think a man with such uncommon job security would feel confident taking risks. Instead, he\u2019s recommitted to making decisions so cautious they actively hurt his football team. Last year, when Iowa went to the Rose Bowl, many Hawkeyes fans claimed that they had witnessed the birth of a \u201cNew Kirk,\u201d one who sometimes rolled the dice. Well, midnight has struck, and Ferentz has turned back into a frog whose mating call is the sound of a foot punting a football. Iowans probably want to stop talking about Ferentz\u2019s salary and extension. Don\u2019t worry, guys: We\u2019ll only make fun of it for another 10 years and two months. Best Trick\u00a0Play This touchdown for Virginia\u2019s Evan Butts\u200a\u2014\u200aBUTTS! Butts is a tight end, but after some pre-snap movement, he ended up as the snapper on this play. He lateraled to Matt Johns, who serves as Virginia\u2019s holder but used to be its starting QB. North Carolina\u2019s defense promptly ignored Butts\u200a\u2014\u200aBUTTS!!!!\u200a\u2014\u200aand he waltzed into the end zone for the easiest touchdown throw of Johns\u2019s career. So, two things here seem weird. First: the snap. Is that legal? Yes: There\u2019s no rule saying players have to snap the ball through their legs. In fact, the rulebook says \u201cthe snap need not be between the snapper\u2019s legs.\u201d But the snap has to be \u201ca quick and continuous backwards motion.\u201d Butts\u2019s snap fits that description. The reason centers tend to snap the ball between their legs is not because it\u2019s the only legal way, but because they need to be in position to block right after the snap. If Butts\u200a\u2014\u200aBUTTS!\u200a\u2014\u200ahad been facing a pass rush here after a snap that turned his body perpendicular to the line, he would\u2019ve been in trouble. Second: What about the fact that the ball is THROWN TO THE GUY WHO SNAPPED IT? What the hell? Well, that\u2019s kosher too. It has to do with how the team is lined up: A team must have seven players on the line of scrimmage for a formation to be legal. Of these seven, the five in the middle are ineligible to catch a pass, and the two on the ends are eligible. In almost every scenario, the guy snapping the ball is one of the five ineligible, since teams normally surround the center with other offensive linemen. Not here! Notice how the two players at the bottom of the screen are about 2 yards behind the line of scrimmage? Butts\u200a\u2014\u200aBUTTS!!!!!!!!\u200a\u2014\u200ais actually the rightmost player on the line of scrimmage, which means he\u2019s allowed to catch a pass. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t matter much, as the Hoos lost 35\u201314. But still, good play. Congrats to Butts. Worst Trick\u00a0Play It actually doesn\u2019t look that bad on video, but I\u2019ll explain why it\u2019s problematic: Michigan State attempted that fake with one second left in the first half. So there was no next play: Either kicker Michael Geiger runs 28 yards to the end zone, or Sparty gets zero points. Kickers are not very fast or good at running, and it is hard for non-kickers to run 28 yards on do-or-die plays. I\u2019d say this was a bad idea. The attempt was a 45-yarder, which is hard to hit. But a slim chance of getting three points is better than an all-but-0 percent chance of getting six points. Harshest Whuppin\u2019 Last year Arkansas beat Auburn in four overtimes, and that kind of defeat stings. This year\u2019s game was a bit less competitive. The Tigers made some Razorback bacon, cutting and frying Arkansas in a 56\u20133 beatdown. Earlier in the year, Gus Malzahn struggled to pick a quarterback, rotating through somewhere between three and 11 options in the season-opening loss to Clemson. Malzahn himself could\u2019ve played QB in Week 8, though, as Auburn ran for 543 yards, a school record in an SEC regular-season game. Meanwhile, Arkansas ran for 25 yards. Twenty-five is less than 543. [Writer\u2019s note: Can we have copy desk check on this? I\u2019m not great at math. Please delete this before we publish. Thanks.] Auburn\u2019s a pendulum. In 2013, the Tigers were picked to finish fifth in the SEC West in the media\u2019s preseason poll. Instead, they made the national title game. Last year, that poll said they\u2019d win the league. Instead, they finished last in the SEC West. This year they were picked sixth in the division. They just ground a pretty good Arkansas team into mush. They\u2019d have to get past Alabama to make the SEC championship game, though. Maybe somebody should schedule a game between those two. Sometime in November sound good? Most Harbaugh\u00a0Moment It\u2019s gotta be this. It\u2019s not the first time Harbaugh\u2019s used this 10-man lineup, which he calls \u201ctrains\u201d and I plan to continuing calling \u201cThe Wolverine Centipede.\u201d But this time it led to a touchdown. The fact that he\u2019s running something so weird repeatedly and effectively is Harbaugh as hell. But wait. Actually, the most Harbaugh moment has to be this. It didn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s possible it wasn\u2019t even Harbaugh\u2019s call\u200a\u2014\u200afake punts are sometimes decided on the field by the players if the opponent is set up in a favorable way\u200a\u2014\u200abut still. Going for a fake punt up 34\u20130 is Harbaugh as hell. BUT WAIT: NO, THAT\u2019S IT. THAT\u2019S THE MOST HARBAUGH THING TODAY. Sorry, it\u2019s hard to pick. Jim Harbaugh exists at 100 percent of his potential every second of his life. Jim Harbaugh Isn\u2019t a Football Coach\u200a\u2014\u200aHe\u2019s an ExperienceWhat\u2019s it like inside this Michigan Man\u2019s brain?theringer.com Most \u201cCollege Football After Dark\u201d\u00a0Thing Pac-12 teams play their games after the rest of the world\u2019s bedtime, and these wee-hours contests often provide college football\u2019s weirdest moments. Defense is optional. If you drink for every point, you\u2019ll die. Friday night, Oregon took on Cal in a game that had the highest over/under total in recorded history, with Vegas predicting the teams would combine for 89 points. Somehow, the oddsmakers underestimated. I didn\u2019t spend my Friday night watching football. I went to some bars in Williamsburg with my girlfriend. At about 10:45 p.m., we arrived at one that had a TV, and I noticed Oregon-Cal had just started. We left at about 1 a.m., and I noticed it was still going. I got home a little bit before 2, and I looked at my phone to check the score and found that THE GAME WAS STILL GOING. My girlfriend went to sleep, like a normal person. I watched two subpar Pac-12 teams play football for another hour. Cal beat Oregon 52\u201349 in double overtime at 2:56 ET on Saturday morning, mercifully providing a loophole that allows me to write about this game in an article called \u201cSaturday Superlatives.\u201d The Golden Bears ran 118 plays, an FBS record. You have to be a glutton to enjoy College Football After Dark. There are more than enough hours of football in a week, and yet some of us still skimp on sleep to fulfill a perverse desire to witness disgusting amounts of points. All we can hope is that our friends and family never discover our disturbing habit. Most \u201cYou\u2019re Old\u201d\u00a0Thing Yes, Jeff George Jr. is Illinois\u2019s starting QB. I think this makes me feel particularly old because Jeff George Sr. kept playing for quite a long time\u200a\u2014\u200ahis last appearance on an NFL roster was in 2006, 16 years after he left Illinois. The younger George is a 20-year-old redshirt freshman. He entered the year as a third-stringer, but starter Wes Lunt got hurt, and so did backup Chayce Crouch, so George Jr. is Illinois\u2019s starter now. Following this news, I made an important discovery, finding this on George Jr.\u2019s Illinois bio page: So, either the question was \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite athlete\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, besides your dad,\u201d or Jeff genuinely prefers Tom Brady to his dad. I\u2019ve actually uncovered some other results from George\u2019s survey: Favorite former Illini athlete: Juice Williams Favorite dad: Peter Griffin from Family Guy Favorite NFL quarterback with two first names: Matt Flynn Favorite Jeff: Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos George\u2019s day didn\u2019t go too well: He went 0-for-7 with an interception in the first half and finished just 4-for-15 with a touchdown. The lesson: It\u2019s probably a bad idea to start a freshman against the no. 3 team in the country, even if his dad was once a no. 1 pick. (And even if he likes Tom Brady.) Least Respectful Moment Some backstory here: After the Big East collapsed, the sad state of UConn football left the Huskies without a conference. They wound up in the AAC, a second-tier league with no other teams anywhere near Connecticut, and they went 3\u20139 in 2013, their first year in the league. They remained awful in 2014, winning only one conference game, against UCF. So in 2015, head coach Bob Diaco announced that UCF was now UConn\u2019s rival. There was no connection between the schools other than the fact that the Huskies had just beaten the Knights. But UConn couldn\u2019t say that about any other AAC foe, so it was their only choice. They even made a trophy and a countdown clock! One problem: UCF straight-up refused to acknowledge the existence of the rivalry. This was embarrassing for Diaco, who no-commented when asked about the trophy this week. But apparently UConn brought it on the field for today\u2019s game anyway. And when UCF won, the Knights declined to take it. It\u2019s one thing to get left at the altar; it\u2019s quite another to send out invitations only to have the supposed bride publicly say, \u201cUhh, what wedding?\u201d I like rivalry trophies; they\u2019re neat traditions, and it\u2019s cool to see athletes lifting hideous hunks of wood and metal. But I think my favorite is this unrequited one. Best Swag For millennia, waves have inspired fear and wonder. In Japan, Hokusai painted the Great Wave off Kanagawa, beautifully demonstrating the unrelenting power of nature. In The Great American Novel, Moby-Dick, Herman Melville wrote not about America, but about the untamed ocean. And who can forget George Costanza\u2019s simple, but iconic words: \u201cThe sea was angry that day, my friends.\u201d Presumably with those inspirations in mind, Tulane is wearing these helmets against Tulsa today. That\u2019s the Angry Wave an old mascot from the 1960s. He does not have a proper name. He is just Angry Wave.

I hope Tulane wears these constantly. Its current mascot is a pelican named \u201cRiptide,\u201d which is infinitely inferior to a furious liquid. Please bring us more Angry Wave.
