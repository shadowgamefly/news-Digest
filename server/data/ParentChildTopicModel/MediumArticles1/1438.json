My first viral post reached 62,000 people. That was a total accident. After that rush, I had to know more. What makes the internet tick? Why do some posts go viral and some disappear into the river of Internet stuff? So I jumped on another platform, studying every angle to see if I could replicate my success. Before too long, I\u2019d created another viral post that reached 470,000 people. I made that one on purpose. My work on Quora has not only gotten me published on world-renowned platforms, it\u2019s been seen over 2 million times. 2 *MILLION* I am honored and humbled. Before we go any further, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: It is not immoral for you to know how the system works. I used to be proud of my ignorance.

This post will also help with that. You spend a lot of time and energy on what you do. Your work deserves to be seen. 1. Determine what is *unique* about the platform. Take a look at the main display for an answer in my Quora feed: At first glance, everything seems pretty normal. Profile picture? Check. Share buttons? Sure. Preview of the content? Seen it before. But take a closer look\u200a\u2014\u200aright up beside the profile name. In Quora, that\u2019s called a \u201ccredential,\u201d and it gives me a chance to know something about you before I get into your actual work. This is a completely unique function to the site which the top writers use to great effect. Check out these examples: A simple tweak, but it works. Can we find something unique about Medium as well? Let\u2019s take a look: At a glance, we see something different from other platforms around the post \u2014publication names. Publications are unique to the Medium platform, and therefore something you must address to get the most out of each post. To go viral, you have to think about what the consumer sees, not just you the creator. This leads me to\u2026 2. Address the whole viewing area, not just your\u00a0post I\u2019ll use YouTube as an example here since there is a massive amount of visual information to process. In your dreams, people come across your video like this: Look at all that screen space! And all my stuff is on the side! But in reality, you\u2019ll be lucky to get this: Ariana, I love you (apparently). What does that mean? You have to know when and where you\u2019ll pop up, and what little things you can do to make your video stand out. In this case, the custom thumbnail is the X factor of the viewing area. It\u2019s almost not worth posting without one. Take a look at the example below. The content of the video with the red box is almost identical to the one in the green box. But guess which one I\u2019m more likely to click if I\u2019m impartial? I pick red. Looking further, we see 2 other chances to grab attention Put AT LEAST as much thought into these as the content itself. Remember, this isn\u2019t just about YouTube. Every platform offers you multiple chances to stand out, but you typically only have a millisecond to hook a new person. 3. ASK for\u00a0shares This is the easiest way to get traction, but 90% of people don\u2019t do it. If you feel shy about asking for shares or recommends (like I did), ask yourself two questions: \u201cDo I believe this is quality\u00a0work?\u201d \u201cDo I believe a single other person on the planet could benefit from\u00a0it?\u201d If the answer to both these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d how could you possibly be embarrassed to ask for a share? Be as creative as you want with this ask, just don\u2019t be apologetic. A simple, strong request for shares goes a long way. 4. Use tested headlines. How do you figure out what makes a good headline? Step 1: Go to the platform in question. Step 2: Click \u201ctop stories\u201d or \u201ctrending\u201d or whatever channel highlights the best stuff. Step 3: Copy the crap out of those headlines. I just did this on Medium\u2019s Top Stories and immediately found a pattern: The pattern is quotes. Next time I\u2019m hurting for a headline, I\u2019ll just grab the best quote from the post and use it instead*. As you learn and experiment with headlines that work, you can also copy your own successes. When something works once, you are allowed to use it again. Like this: To be honest, I\u2019m crediting the extra 600+ recommends to the attractive eyes on the first\u00a0post. (*Note\u200a\u2014\u200aThe last post in the Medium Top Stories example doesn\u2019t purely use the quote tactic, but I included it because it copies other patterns which are successful on Medium: 5.

Watch how you are pulled in: \u201cSomewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the pages and stand boldly before\u00a0you.\u201d Translation: You have to read the whole book, maybe more than once, before you get what I\u2019m saying to you. \u201cYou will recognize this secret at least once in every chapter.\u201d Translation: You better read until the end or else you won\u2019t get all the secret has to offer \u201cWithout the secret, [men and women] might go through life as failures.\u201d Translation: Do you really want to be a failure?
