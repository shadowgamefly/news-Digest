There was Trump wine, there were Trump steaks, there were pictures. We know this because Mike Allen of Axios posted a bunch of pictures on Twitter last night. It was off the record, but you could post pictures, as he told us in his tweets. And then there was one final picture of all of the reporters who went to this, smiling with Donald Trump, giving his little thumbs-up there."}, {"d944": "Jon Lovett: Like a class photo."}, {"f400": "J.F.: So this obviously engendered quite a bit of criticism on Twitter last night. Some reporters and liberals thought it was completely outrageous because Trump has threatened the press and refused to hold a press conference in [145] days. Others thought, \u201cHey, it\u2019s an off-the-record meeting. You get to talk to the president-elect of the United States. What reporter refuses that? You can learn important information.\u201d And then I think everyone thought the picture was pretty fucking silly."}, {"d93c": "J.L.: No one\u2019s a fan of the photoshoot.

So at this point [in 2008], Obama had held like a half dozen or more availabilities with press. Trump hasn\u2019t done that; he hasn\u2019t named a real press secretary. They\u2019re talking about it being [an] RNC communications guy, Sean Spicer. He might be a known quantity with the press, but he\u2019s certainly not in the Trump inner circle the way Robert Gibbs was [with Obama] back in 2008. I think it\u2019s absolutely fine to do off-the-record conversations with the press. I think it\u2019s good for them to get to know him. I set up many of those myself with President Obama."}, {"8a5f": "It\u2019s that I don\u2019t think the press corps is fighting hard enough for things that are really important. That\u2019s what makes me nervous. The way the correspondents\u2019 association has been relatively impotent so far as they\u2019ve seen their access curtailed and they\u2019ve gotten nothing from the Trump Organization. I think the photo sort of encapsulates it because it has this sort of giddy tone of a tourist snapping a photo when they met a celebrity. It doesn\u2019t bring with it the gravitas of how serious the job is. Especially when it\u2019s a president who\u2019s more hostile to the press than any since [Richard] Nixon."}, {"6445": "J.F.: This is an example of sort of asymmetrical warfare. Trump violates norms and institutions all the time and then he counts on the rest of us to not. So, like, \u201cTrump, you\u2019re not supposed to threaten the press. You\u2019re not supposed to get your crowds riled up and attacking the press. You\u2019re not supposed to restrict access. You\u2019re not supposed to do these things.\u201d But it\u2019s not law. At least most of it\u2019s not law, but it\u2019s just the way things are done. Trump says, \u201cFuck the way things are done. I\u2019m going to do whatever I want.\u201d The press, on the other hand, will say, \u201cOff-the-record meetings happen all the time. That\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re going to go to the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner when Trump goes and tells jokes. That\u2019s what we always do.\u201d"}, {"cbf7": "J.L.: Look, and when they call me and offer me a contract to write those jokes, who am I to say no to that check? I\u2019ve got to eat."}, {"c54a": "J.F.: So Trump wins on both accounts. Because when he wants to violate norms and shake up institutions, he can, and when he wants to use them for his benefit, like he did last night, he can also do that."}, {"ff32": "The Press Needs Trump More Than Trump Needs the\u00a0Press"}, {"afa4": "J.L.: Two things. One, this is not the first time the press have challenged an off-the-record gathering because there hasn\u2019t been enough on-the-record access. Amy Chozick of The New York Times was talking about how in 2008, The New York Times and the AP sat out of an off-the-record gathering with Hillary Clinton because she wasn\u2019t doing enough on-the-record conversations and, moving forward, [Clinton] did more on-the-record conversations. So it\u2019s of course fine for reporters to talk to politicians off the record as long as there is also plenty of on-the-record conversation. So this is not only a case where they\u2019re not upholding a norm, they\u2019re bending over backward to give this guy credit and to give him a chance because they\u2019re so afraid of losing access because Donald Trump understands that at this point, the press needs him more than he needs them."}, {"affb": "J.F.: Right. There was a reporter who tweeted on Friday that if Obama had done more press conferences, he would have left a better legacy and it would\u2019ve made it easier to hold future presidents\u2019 feet to the fire in terms of that kind of access, and I thought that was an incredibly stupid [and] naive thing to say because they are the ones who have to hold presidents accountable. If the press corps wants to demand more access, they need to be far more adversarial than they\u2019ve been. And you have Reince Priebus on TV talking about fundamentally changing the way you do press briefings. Not only access to Donald Trump himself but even just the press secretary. So there was this erosion of access and [the media\u2019s] response has not been close to sufficient to me with how serious of a threat this is to all of us who rely on the press for information."}, {"1e06": "But isn\u2019t it a bit of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma too? Because for the press to take action here, they have to all agree to do it together. And if a couple of them decided to protest last night and not go to Mar-a-Lago, then they lose out and their competitors go and get the information, right?"}, {"c665": "J.L.: Yeah, but that\u2019s always the cost of fighting for a better kind of access at the expense of short-term access that benefits the candidate or the president. Yes, that\u2019s always why things end up off the record.\u00a0\u2026 There are so many outlets. There are so many reporters. They are all competing for the same limited amount of attention from powerful people. Look, the Obama administration has made use of that power dynamic and now Trump, without the same kind of moral standards, is using it even more. And that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be unless these outlets and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association find a way to use its muscle."}, {"d27e": "T.V.: The broader problem is that it used to be that there could be some utility in reporters\u00a0\u2026 refusing to go to a briefing as a group. In that it would have an actual cost for the president in terms of getting his message out. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know that that avenue is there anymore. Like [Trump\u2019s] best buddy Sean Hannity is always going to be there to take his phone call and put him on air. Trump adviser Joe Scarborough will always welcome his call on Morning Joe.\u00a0\u2026 So that\u2019s the change in the landscape of the media that gives Trump even more power and means the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association needs to be even tougher than they\u2019ve been."}, {"d5a9": "J.L.: And maybe also recognizing that there\u2019s a double-edged sword in that if a lack of access doesn\u2019t cost Trump that much, then maybe access doesn\u2019t get him that much and doesn\u2019t get [the media] that much."}, {"a512": "T.V.: Right. Look at Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair had [the most] daily sign-ups in [its 103-year] history because Trump attacked them on Twitter. There is a good business to be made in being adversarial. The three of us know a little something about that on this podcast. So reporters need to get as tough as humanly possible and start digging into this guy. And who cares if you get a backgrounder with Reince Priebus? Move on. Figure out a way to do your job without it."}, {"c92a": "J.F.: Also, does Trump really want to be seen smiling, thumbs-up, with the crooked media?"}, {"58c1": "J.L.: He does, because it says, I own these people now.
