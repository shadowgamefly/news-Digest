Though it\u2019s a basic need, there are many in India who can\u2019t afford high priced electricity. So the government has worked out slab systems to make it affordable for the poor. Basically the more electricity you consume, the higher charges you will pay per unit. Anything above 500 units in a bi-monthly cycle will put you into the highest slab. The table below shows the slab system in the state I live in. Top level slab: My current bi-monthly bill is \u20b92700, which puts me in the top slab. Based on that, I worked out my electricity cost breakup for my bill. My actual bi-monthly consumption without the solar unit for the last two\u00a0months. Effect of Solar: I\u2019m currently consuming 647 units in this bi-monthly cycle. Let\u2019s say my solar unit reduces my electric consumption by 1.5 units a day, or 90 units in two months.

Savings with\u00a0Solar I will save \u20b9600 every two months. Since the actual cost of the solar unit was \u20b920000, it will take around six years to recover that cost.

WITH Solar (less 90 units): Bi-monthly consumption with AC for the next two\u00a0months. AC is the killer: Once the rainy season begins in a couple of months, I will switch back to fans instead of the AC.

WITHOUT Solar: Bi-monthly consumption without AC for the next two\u00a0months. WITH Solar: Bi-monthly consumption without AC for the next two\u00a0months. Conclusion In both cases, consumption will be below 500 units so I will drop down to a lower slab and pay less per unit. What\u2019s more, in the \u2018no AC\u2019 scenario, the savings from using solar power is barely \u20b9270 every two months. At this rate, it will take more than 12 years to recover my \u20b920000 investment.
